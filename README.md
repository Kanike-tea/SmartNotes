# SmartNotes
SmartNotes is a deep learning–powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system designed to accurately transcribe handwritten text from scanned or digital note images. It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTM) within a CTC-loss-based CRNN architecture to efficiently recognize unconstrained handwriting.
