processing operations. In contrast, CISC processors have dedicated registers for specific
purposes.

4. Load-store architecture—The processor operates on data held in registers. Separate load
and store instructions transfer data between the register bank and external memory.
Memory accesses are costly, so separating memory accesses from data processing pro-
vides an advantage because you can use data items held in the register bank multiple
times without needing multiple memory accesses. In contrast, with a CISC design the
data processing operations can act on memory directly.

‘These design rules allow a RISC processor to be simpler, and thus the core can operate
at higher clock frequencies. In contrast, traditional CISC processors are more complex
and operate at lower clock frequencies. Over the course of two decades, however, the
distinction between RISC and CISC has blurred as CISC processors have implemented
more RISC concepts.

1.2 THE ARM DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

‘There are a number of physical features that have driven the ARM processor design. First,
portable embedded systems require some form of battery power. The ARM processor has
been specifically designed to be small to reduce power consumption and extend battery
operation—essential for applications such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants
(PDAs).

High code density is another major requirement since embedded systems have lim-
ited memory due to cost and/or physical size restrictions. High code density is useful for
applications that have limited on-board memory, such as mobile phones and mass storage
devices.

In addition, embedded systems are price sensitive and use slow and low-cost memory
devices. For high-volume applications like digital cameras, every cent has to be accounted
for in the design. The ability to use low-cost memory devices produces substantial savings.

Another important requirement is to reduce the area of the die taken up by the embedded
processor. For a single-chip solution, the smaller the area used by the embedded processor,
the more available space for specialized peripherals. This in turn reduces the cost of the
design and manufacturing since fewer discrete chips are required for the end product.

ARM has incorporated hardware debug technology within the processor so that software
engineers can view what is happening while the processor is executing code. With greater
visibility, software engineers can resolve issues faster, which has a direct effect on the time
to market and reduces overall development costs.

The ARM core is not a pure RISC architecture because of the constraints of its primary
application—the embedded system. In some sense, the strength of the ARM core is that
it does not take the RISC concept too far. In today’s systems the key is not raw processor
speed but total effective system performance and power consumption.
