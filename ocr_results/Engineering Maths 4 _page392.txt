SAMPLING THEORY 383

The total shaded area 0.05 being the level of significance of the test, represents the
probability of making: type-I error. (rejecting the hypothesis when it should have been
accepted). The set of values of z outside the range — 1.96, 1.96. constitutes the critical

(significant) region or the region of rejecting the hypothesis whereas the values of z

within the same range constitutes the insignificant region or the region of acceptance
of the hypothesis.

- _ © One tailed and two tailed tests

In our test of acceptance or non acceptance of a hypothesis we concentrated on the
value of z on both sides of the mean. This can be categorically stated that the focus of

attention lies in the'two "tails" of the distribution and hence such a test is called a twvo
_ tailed test. : '

Sometimes we will be interested in the extreme values to only one side of the mean in
which case the region of significance will be a region to one side of the distribution.
Obviously the area of such a region will be equal to the level of significance itself. Such
‘a test is called a one tailed test.

" The critical values of z :~ 1.96 , 1.96 as already stated with reference to 5% and 1% level

", of significance can be understood as the values in respect of a two tailed test. However
the critical values of z in respect of a one tailed test (as found in the table of areas under a
normal curve) are [- 1.645, 1.645] ; [- 2.33, 2.33] at 5% and 1% level of significance
respectively.

The following table will be useful for working problems.

Critical values of z

Two-tailed test -1.96 and 1.96 —2.58 and 2.58

Tests of significance for large samples
e Test of significance of proportions

In the discussion of probability distributions we have remarked that the normal

distribution is the limiting form of the binomial distribution whenn is large and neither

. pnorq is small. Let us suppose that we take N samples, each having n members. Let p
be the probability of success of each member and q of failure so that p+q = 1.The
frequencies of samples with successes 0, 1, 2,... mare the terms of the binomial

* expansion of N (q +p)". Thus the binomial distribution is regarded as the sampling
distribution of the number of successes in the sample.

"” We know that the mean of this distribution is np and S.D is Vupq.

‘Let us consider the proportion of successes.
