116 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

= Inserting an entity in a superclass implies that the entity is mandatorily
inserted in all predicate-defined (or attribute-defined) subclasses for which
the entity satisfies the defining predicate.

= Inserting an entity in a superclass of a total specialization implies that
the entity is mandatorily inserted in at least one of the subclasses of the
specialization.

The reader is encouraged to make a complete list of rules for insertions and dele-
tions for the various types of specializations.

4.3.2 Specialization and Generalization Hierarchies
and Lattices

A subclass itself may have further subclasses specified on it, forming a hierarchy or
a lattice of specializations. For example, in Figure 4.6 ENGINEER is a subclass of
EMPLOYEE and is also a superclass of ENGINEERING_MANAGER; this represents the
real-world constraint that every engineering manager is required to be an engineer.
A specialization hierarchy has the constraint that every subclass participates as a
subclass in only one class/subclass relationship; that is, each subclass has only one
parent, which results in a tree structure or strict hierarchy. In contrast, for a
specialization lattice, a subclass can be a subclass in more than one class/subclass
relationship. Hence, Figure 4.6 is a lattice.

Figure 4.7 shows another specialization lattice of more than one level. This may
be part of a conceptual schema for a UNIVERSITY database. Notice that this
arrangement would have been a hierarchy except for the STUDENT_ASSISTANT
subclass, which is a subclass in two distinct class/subclass relationships.
