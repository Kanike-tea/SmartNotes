— place their 4-bit ID numbers on four open-collector lines ARB 0 through ARB 3 .
¢ A winner is selected as a result of interaction among signals transmitted over these lines.
¢ Net-outcome is that the code on 4 lines represents request that has the highest ID number.
Advantage:
This approach offers higher reliability since operation of bus is not dependent on any single device.

ARBO

Interface circuit
for device A

Figure 4.22 A distributed arbitration scheme.
For example:

» Assume 2 devices A & B have their ID 5 (0101), 6 (0110) and their code is 0111.
» Each device compares the pattern on the arbitration line to its own ID starting from MSB.
> If the device detects a difference at any bit position, it disables the drivers at that bit position.
> Driver is disabled by placing 0” at the input of the driver.
> Ine.g. “A” detects a difference in line ARB1, hence it disables the drivers on lines ARB1 & ARBO.
> This causes pattern on arbitration-line to change to 0110. This means that “B” has
won contention.
BUS
* Bus — is used to inter-connect main-memory, processor &I/O-devices
— includes lines needed to support interrupts & arbitration.

¢ Primary function: To provide a communication-path for transfer of data.
¢ Bus protocol is set of rules that govern the behavior of various devices connected to the buses.
¢ Bus-protocol specifies parameters such as:
— asserting control-signals
— timing of placing information on bus
— rate of data-transfer.
A typical bus consists of 3 sets of lines:
1) Address,
2) Data &
3) Control lines.
¢ Control-signals
— specify whether a read or a write-operation is to be performed.
— carry timing information i.e. they specify time at which I/O-devices place data on the bus.
© R/W line specifies
— read-operation when R/W=1.
— write-operation when R/W=0.
¢ During data-transfer operation,
> One device plays the role of a bus-master.
> Master-device initiates the data-transfer by issuing read/write command on the bus.
> The device addressed by the master is called as Slave.
© Two types of Buses: 1) Synchronous and 2) Asynchronous.
