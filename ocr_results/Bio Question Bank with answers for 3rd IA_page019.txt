images of the body's internal structures and functions, bio-imaging can help to
improve patient outcomes by enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses, and more

effective treatments.

e Advancements in research: Bio-imaging technologies are also important in
advancing medical research, by providing detailed images of the body's internal
structures and functions, which can help researchers to better understand the

underlying mechanisms of diseases and develop new treatments.

Ans. (a) Electronic nose

The electrical nose, also known as an electronic nose, is a technology used in food science for
the analysis and characterization of food and beverage aromas and flavors. The electrical nose
typically consists of a sensor array that is capable of detecting and quantifying volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) in food and beverage samples.

Technology behind the Electronic Nose

The sensors in the electrical nose work by measuring the changes in electrical resistance or
capacitance that occur when the sensors are exposed to volatile organic compounds. Each
sensor in the array is designed to respond to a specific range of volatile organic compounds,
and the combination of signals from all of the sensors allows for the analysis of the overall
aroma and flavor profile of a sample.

Sensor Array in Electronic Nose

In electronic nose applications, a sensory array refers to a collection of multiple sensors that
are designed to detect and analyze odor molecules. The sensors in the array are often selective
to different chemical properties or patterns, allowing for the identification and differentiation
of various odors. Here are some examples of sensor types commonly used in sensory arrays for
electronic noses:

Metal Oxide Sensors (MOS):

Metal oxide sensors, such as tin oxide (SnO2) or zinc oxide (ZnO) sensors, are widely used in
electronic noses. They detect changes in electrical resistance when exposed to different odor
molecules. MOS sensors offer broad sensitivity to a wide range of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs).

Conducting Polymer Sensors:

Conducting polymer sensors are made of organic polymers that undergo changes in electrical
conductivity when exposed to specific odor molecules. These sensors can be tailored to be
selective to different types of odors based on the polymer composition.
