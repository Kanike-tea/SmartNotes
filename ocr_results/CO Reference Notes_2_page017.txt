* EQU informs the assembler about the value of an identifier (Figure: 2.18).
Ex: SUM EQU 200 ;Informs assembler that the name SUM should be replaced by the value 200.
ORIGIN tells the assembler about the starting-address of memory-area to place the data block.
Ex: ORIGIN 204 ;Instructs assembler to initiate data-block at memory-locations starting from 204.
* DATAWORD directive tells the assembler to load a value into the location.
Ex: N DATAWORD 100 ; Informs the assembler to load data 100 into the memory-location N(204).
+ RESERVE directive is used to reserve a block of memory.
Ex: NUMI RESERVE 400 ;declares a memory-block of 400 bytes is to be reserved for data.
+ END directive tells the assembler that this is the end of the source-program text.
+ RETURN directive identifies the point at which execution of the program should be terminated.
+ Any statement that makes instructions or data being placed in a memory-location may be given a
label. The label(say N or NUM 1) is assigned a value equal to the address of that location.

GENERAL FORMAT OF A STATEMENT

+ Most assembly languages require statements in a source program to be written in the form:

Label | Operation | Operands | Comment

1) Label is an optional name associated with the memory-address where the machine language
instruction produced from the statement will be loaded.

2) Operation Field contains the OP-code mnemonic of the desired instruction or assembler.
3) Operand Field contains addressing information for accessing one or more

operands, depending on the type of instruction.

4) Comment Field is used for documentation purposes to make program easier to understand.

ASSEMBLY AND EXECUTION OF PRGRAMS

+ Programs written in an assembly language are automatically translated into a sequence of machine
instructions by the Assembler .

* Assembler Program
— Replaces all symbols denoting operations & addressing-modes with binary-codes used
in machine instructions.
— Replaces all names and labels with their actual values.
— Assigns addresses to instructions & data blocks, starting at address given in ORIGIN directive
— inserts constants that may be given in DATAWORD directives.
— reserves memory-space as requested by RESERVE directives.
* Two Pass Assembler has 2 passes:
1) First Pass: Work out all the addresses of labels.
> As the assembler scans through a source-program, it keeps track of all names of numerical-
values that correspond to them in a symbol-table.
2) Second Pass: Generate machine code, substituting values for the labels.
> When a name appears a second time in the source-program, it is replaced with its value from
the table.
* The assembler stores the object-program on a magnetic-disk. The object-program must be loaded
into the memory of the computer before it is executed. For this, a Loader Program is used.
+ Debugger Program is used to help the user find the programming errors.
+ Debugger program enables the user
— to stop execution of the object-program at some points of interest &
— to examine the contents of various processor-registers and memory-location.
