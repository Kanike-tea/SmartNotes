What does the term unnormalized relation refer to? How did the normal forms
develop historically from first normal form up to Boyce-Codd normal form?

Define first, second, and third normal forms when only primary keys are
considered. How do the general definitions of 2NF and 3NF, which consider
all keys of a relation, differ from those that consider only primary keys?

What undesirable dependencies are avoided when a relation is in 2NF?
What undesirable dependencies are avoided when a relation is in 3NF?

In what way do the generalized definitions of 2NF and 3NF extend the defi-
nitions beyond primary keys?

Define Boyce-Codd normal form. How does it differ from 3NF? Why is it
considered a stronger form of 3NF?

What is multivalued dependency? When does it arise?

Does a relation with two or more columns always have an MVD? Show with
an example.

Define fourth normal form. When is it violated? When is it typically applicable?
Define join dependency and fifth normal form.
Why is 5NF also called project-join normal form (PJNF)?

Why do practical database designs typically aim for BCNF and not aim for
higher normal forms?

Suppose that we have the following requirements for a university database

that is used to keep track of students’ transcripts:

a. The university keeps track of each student’s name (Sname), student num-
ber (Snum), Social Security number (Ssn), current address (Sc_addr) and
phone (Sc_phone), permanent address (Sp_addr) and phone (Sp_phone),
birth date (Bdate), sex (Sex), class (Class) (‘freshman’, ‘sophomore’, ... ,
“‘graduate’), major department (Major_code), minor department
(Minor_code) (if any), and degree program (Prog) (‘b.a.’, ‘b.s.’, ... , ‘ph.d.’).
Both Ssn and student number have unique values for each student.

b. Each department is described by a name (Dname), department code
(Dcode), office number (Doffice), office phone (Dphone), and college
(Dcollege). Both name and code have unique values for each department.

c. Each course has a course name (Cname), description (Cdesc), course
number (Cnum), number of semester hours (Credit), level (Level), and
offering department (Cdept). The course number is unique for each
course.
