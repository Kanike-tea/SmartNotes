Database Management System [BCS403]

In ER diagrams, relationship types are displayed as diamond-shaped boxes, which are connected by
straight lines to the rectangular boxes representing the participating entity types. The relationship name is

displayed in the diamond-shaped box.

3.4.2 Relationship Degree, Role Names, and Recursive Relationships
Degree of a Relationship Type
The degree of a relationship type is the number of participating entity types. A relationship type of

degree two is called binary, and one of degree three is called ternary An example of a binary

relationship WORKS_FOR and ternary relationship is SUPPLY

SUPPLIER SUPPLY

PROJECT

Figure 3.4.2(a): Some relationship instances in the SUPPLY ternary relationship set.

Each relationship instance rj associates three entities—a supplier s, a part p and a project j—whenever s

supplies part p to project j.

Relationships as Attributes

It is sometimes convenient to think of a binary relationship type in terms of attributes. Consider the
WORKS FOR relationship type. One can think of an attribute called Department of the EMPLOYEE
entity type, where the value of Department for each EMPLOYEE entity is a reference to the
DEPARTMENT entity for which that employee works. This concept of representing relationship types as
attributes is used in a class of data models called functional data models.

In relational databases, foreign keys are a type of reference attribute used to represent relationships.
