which triggers an immune response and the production of antibodies against the virus.

The first RNA vaccine for COVID 19, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, was authorized for

emergency use in December 2020 and has been administered to millions of people

worldwide. Another RNA vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, was also authorized for emergency

use in December 2020.

Importance of RNA vaccine for Covid 19

RNA vaccines have emerged as a promising tool for preventing the spread of COVID-

19, offering several key advantages over traditional vaccine approaches. Here are some

of the main reasons why RNA vaccines are important in the fight against COVID-19:

High efficacy: RNA vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at
preventing COVID-19 infections. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA
vaccines, for example, have reported efficacy rates of around 95% in clinical
trials.

Rapid development: RNA vaccines can be rapidly developed and manufactured
making them particularly useful in the context of a pandemic. The Pfizer-
BioNTech vaccine, for instance, was developed in under a year, and went from
the initial discovery of the viral genome to emergency use authorization in less
than 11 months.

Easy to modify: RNA vaccines can be easily modified to target new strains of
variants of the virus. This means that if a new variant emerges that is resistant to
the existing vaccines, it is possible to quickly modify the vaccine to provide
protection against the new strain.

Safe: RNA vaccines are generally considered safe, as they do not contain any live
virus particles. They work by instructing cells to produce a harmless piece of the
virus (in this case, the spike protein), which triggers an immune response that

provides protection against the virus.
