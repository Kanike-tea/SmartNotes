The Enhanced Entity—Relationship
(EER) Model

T* ER modeling concepts discussed in Chapter 3
are sufficient for representing many database sche-
mas for traditional database applications, which include many data-processing
applications in business and industry. Since the late 1970s, however, designers of
database applications have tried to design more accurate database schemas that
reflect the data properties and constraints more precisely. This was particularly
important for newer applications of database technology, such as databases for
engineering design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM),' telecommunications, com-
plex software systems, and geographic information systems (GISs), among many
other applications. These types of databases have requirements that are more com-
plex than the more traditional applications. This led to the development of addi-
tional semantic data modeling concepts that were incorporated into conceptual
data models such as the ER model. Various semantic data models have been pro-
posed in the literature. Many of these concepts were also developed independently
in related areas of computer science, such as the knowledge representation area of
artificial intelligence and the object modeling area in software engineering.

In this chapter, we describe features that have been proposed for semantic data
models and show how the ER model can be enhanced to include these concepts,
which leads to the enhanced ER (EER) model.” We start in Section 4.1 by incorpo-
rating the concepts of class/subclass relationships and type inheritance into the ER
model. Then, in Section 4.2, we add the concepts of specialization and generalization.
Section 4.3 discusses the various types of constraints on specialization/generalization,
and Section 4.4 shows how the UNION construct can be modeled by including the
