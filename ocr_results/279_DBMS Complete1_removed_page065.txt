Suppose we want complete information of the full time employees.

The natural join (Employee ms Fulltime-works),, 1) result into the loss of information for

Suleman and Rehman because they don’t have record in both the tables ( left and right

relation). The outer join will solve the problem.

Three forms of outer join:

o Left outer join): the tuples which doesn’t match while doing natural join from
left relation are also added in the result putting null values in missing field of right
relation.

o Right outer join?*): the tuples which doesn’t match while natural join from right
relation are also added in the result putting null values in missing field of left
relation.

© Full outer join(?™>): include both of the left and right outer joins ie. adds the
tuples which did not match either in left relation or right relation and put null in
place of missing values.
The result for three forms of outer join are as follows:
Employee 2 Fulltime-works_
