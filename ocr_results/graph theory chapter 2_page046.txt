2.5.1. Chromatic Polynomials

If 4 colours are used, find in how many ways can this graph be properly coloured?

Vy v2

V4 v3

» Let us redesignate GZ.as H. Then, from the definitions of Gi and Gi*, we find that H, = G
and H; = G;*. Now, applying the decomposition theorem to H, we get

P(H,, A) = P(H,A) + PH, A)

This is the same as
P(G, A) = P(Gz, A) + P(Gz*,A)

which is the required result.
For the graph G shown in Figure 2.58, if e = (v2, v4}, the graphs G7 and Gi* are as shown

below: -

We note that Gt is Ky and Gt* is K3. Therefore,

P(G?.A) = P(Ks,) = MA - 1A - 2a -3)
and P(G3*, A) = P(K3, A) = AA - 1-2).
