Review Questions

insertion is very simple. We discussed the deletion problem and the use of dele-
tion markers.

Ordered files shorten the time required to read records in order of the ordering
field. The time required to search for an arbitrary record, given the value of its
ordering key field, is also reduced if a binary search is used. However, maintaining
the records in order makes insertion very expensive; thus the technique of using an
unordered overflow file to reduce the cost of record insertion was discussed. Over-
flow records are merged with the master file periodically, and deleted records are
physically dropped during file reorganization.

Hashing provides very fast access to an arbitrary record of a file, given the value of
its hash key. The most suitable method for external hashing is the bucket technique,
with one or more contiguous blocks corresponding to each bucket. Collisions caus-
ing bucket overflow are handled by open addressing, chaining, or multiple hashing.
Access on any nonhash field is slow, and so is ordered access of the records on any
field. We discussed three hashing techniques for files that grow and shrink in the
number of records dynamically: extendible, dynamic, and linear hashing. The first
two use the higher-order bits of the hash address to organize a directory. Linear
hashing is geared to keep the load factor of the file within a given range and adds
new buckets linearly.

We briefly discussed other possibilities for primary file storage and organization,
such as B-trees, and files of mixed records, which implement relationships among
records of different types physically as part of the storage structure. We reviewed
the recent advances in disk technology represented by RAID (redundant arrays of
inexpensive (or independent) disks), which has become a standard technique in
large enterprises to provide better reliability and fault tolerance features in storage.
Finally, we reviewed some modern trends in enterprise storage systems: storage
area networks (SANs), network-attached storage (NAS), iSCSI and other network
based protocols, automatic storage tiering, and finally object-based storage,
which is playing a major role in storage architecture of data centers offering
cloud-based services.
