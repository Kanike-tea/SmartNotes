Synthetic Polymer-based Bioinks:

Synthetic polymers can be used to create bioinks with well-defined mechanical properties
and degradation rates. These bioinks provide control over various parameters, such as stiffness,
porosity, and degradation, to support specific tissue engineering goals. Examples of synthetic
polymer-based bioinks include:

e Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based bioinks
e Polycaprolactone (PCL)-based bioinks
e Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based bioinks

Composite Bioinks:

Composite bioinks combine different materials to enhance the bioink's properties, such as
mechanical strength, printability, and cell behavior. These bioinks often contain a combination of
natural and synthetic materials or a mixture of different biomaterials. Examples:

e Gelatin-methacryloyl (GeIMA) combined with alginate
e Collagen combined with hyaluronic acid (HA)
e Fibrin combined with nanoparticles or growth factors

Most Commonly used Bioprinting Techniques

Bioprinting techniques involve the precise deposition of bioinks to create three-
dimensional structures with living cells. Several techniques have been developed to accomplish
this, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here are some of the most commonly used
bioprinting techniques:

Inkjet-based Bioprinting:
