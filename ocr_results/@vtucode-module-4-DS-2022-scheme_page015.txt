The bridges of Koenigsberg

Euler defined the degree of a vertex as the number of edges incident on it. He then showed
that there is a walk starting at any vertex, going through each edge exactly once, and
terminating at the starting vertex iff the degree of each vertex is even. We now call a walk
that does this an Eulerian walk. Since this first application, graphs have been used in a wide
variety of applications, including analysis of electrical circuits, finding shortest routes,
project planning, and the identification of chemical compounds. Indeed graphs may be the
most widely used of all mathematical structures.

5.1.2 Definitions

A graph, G, consists of two sets: a finite, nonempty set of vertices, and a finite, possibly empty
set of edges. V(G) and E(G) represent the sets of vertices and edges of G, respectively.
Alternately, we may write G = (V, E) to represent a graph.

An undirected graph is one in which the pair of vertices representing any edge is unordered.
For example, the pairs (vo, vi) and (vo, vi) represent the same edge.

A directed graph is one in which we represent each edge as a directed pair of vertices. For
example, the pair <vp, v\> represents an edge in which vp is the tail and v; is the head.

Therefore, <vo, vi> and <v }, vo> represent two different edges in a directed graph.
