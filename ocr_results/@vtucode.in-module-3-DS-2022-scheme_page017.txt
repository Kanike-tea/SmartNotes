BINARY TREE REPRESENTATION
The storage representation of binary trees can be classified as
. Array representation

Linked representation.

Array representation:

A tree can be represented using an array, which is called sequential representation.

The nodes are numbered from | to n, and one dimensional array can be used to store the
nodes.

Position 0 of this array is left empty and the node numbered 7 is mapped to,position i of
the array.

Below figure shows the array representation for both the trees of figure (a).

e For complete binary tree the array representation is ideal, as no space is wasted.
e For the skewed tree less than half the array is utilized.
