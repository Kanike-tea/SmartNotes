Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

Other features of the relational model are presented in subsequent parts of the
book. Chapter 9 relates the relational model data structures to the constructs of the
ER and EER models (presented in Chapters 3 and 4), and presents algorithms for
designing a relational database schema by mapping a conceptual schema in the ER
or EER model into a relational representation. These mappings are incorporated
into many database design and CASE! tools. Chapters 10 and 11 in Part 4 discuss
the programming techniques used to access database systems and the notion of
connecting to relational databases via ODBC and JDBC standard protocols. We
also introduce the topic of Web database programming in Chapter 11. Chapters 14
and 15 in Part 6 present another aspect of the relational model, namely the formal
constraints of functional and multivalued dependencies; these dependencies are
used to develop a relational database design theory based on the concept known as
normalization.

In this chapter, we concentrate on describing the basic principles of the relational
model of data. We begin by defining the modeling concepts and notation of the
relational model in Section 5.1. Section 5.2 is devoted to a discussion of relational
constraints that are considered an important part of the relational model and are
automatically enforced in most relational DBMSs. Section 5.3 defines the update
operations of the relational model, discusses how violations of integrity constraints
are handled, and introduces the concept of a transaction. Section 5.4 summarizes
the chapter.

This chapter and Chapter 8 focus on the formal foundations of the relational model,
whereas Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the SQL practical relational model, which is the
basis of most commercial and open source relational DBMSs. Many concepts are
common between the formal and practical models, but a few differences exist that
we shall point out.

5.1 Relational Model Concepts

The relational model represents the database as a collection of relations. Informally,
each relation resembles a table of values or, to some extent, a flat file of records. It is
called a flat file because each record has a simple linear or flat structure. For exam-
ple, the database of files that was shown in Figure 1.2 is similar to the basic rela-
tional model representation. However, there are important differences between
relations and files, as we shall soon see.

When a relation is thought of as a table of values, each row in the table represents a
collection of related data values. A row represents a fact that typically corresponds
to a real-world entity or relationship. The table name and column names are used
to help to interpret the meaning of the values in each row. For example, the
first table of Figure 1.2 is called STUDENT because each row represents facts
about a particular student entity. The column names—Name, Student_number,

'CASE stands for computer-aided software engineering.
