Bioprinting Techniques and Materials

Bioprinting is a rapidly growing field that uses various techniques to produce three-
dimensional (3D) structures and functional biological tissues for medical and _ scientific
applications. The main objective of bioprinting is to mimic the structure and function of human
tissues and organs, leading to the development of replacement parts for damaged or diseased
