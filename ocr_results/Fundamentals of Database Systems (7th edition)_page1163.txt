30.2 Discretionary Access Control Based on Granting and Revoking Privileges

The DBMS must now revoke the SELECT privilege on EMPLOYEE from A@, and it
must also automatically revoke the SELECT privilege on EMPLOYEE from A4.
This is because A3 granted that privilege to A4, but A3 does not have the privilege
any more.

Next, suppose that A1 wants to give back to A3 a limited capability to SELECT from
the EMPLOYEE relation and wants to allow A to be able to propagate the privilege.
The limitation is to retrieve only the Name, Bdate, and Address attributes and only
for the tuples with Dno = 5. A1 then can create the following view:

CREATE VIEW A3EMPLOYEE AS
SELECT Name, Bdate, Address
FROM EMPLOYEE

WHERE Dno = 5;

After the view is created, A1 can grant SELECT on the view ASEMPLOYEE to A3
as follows:

GRANT SELECT ON A3EMPLOYEE TO A3 WITH GRANT OPTION;

Finally, suppose that A1 wants to allow A4 to update only the Salary attribute of
EMPLOYEE; A1 can then issue the following command:

GRANT UPDATE ON EMPLOYEE (Salary) TO A4;

The UPDATE and INSERT privileges can specify particular attributes that may be
updated or inserted in a relation. Other privileges (SELECT, DELETE) are not attri-
bute specific, because this specificity can easily be controlled by creating the appro-
priate views that include only the desired attributes and granting the corresponding
privileges on the views. However, because updating views is not always possible (see
Chapter 8), the UPDATE and INSERT privileges are given the option to specify the
particular attributes of a base relation that may be updated.

30.2.6 Specifying Limits on Propagation of Privileges

Techniques to limit the propagation of privileges have been developed, although
they have not yet been implemented in most DBMSs and are not a part of SQL.
Limiting horizontal propagation to an integer number i means that an account B
given the GRANT OPTION can grant the privilege to at most i other accounts.
Vertical propagation is more complicated; it limits the depth of the granting of
privileges. Granting a privilege with a vertical propagation of zero is equivalent to
granting the privilege with no GRANT OPTION. If account A grants a privilege to
account B with the vertical propagation set to an integer number j > 0, this means
that the account B has the GRANT OPTION on that privilege, but B can grant the
privilege to other accounts only with a vertical propagation less than j. In effect,
vertical propagation limits the sequence of GRANT OPTIONS that can be given from
one account to the next based on a single original grant of the privilege.

We briefly illustrate horizontal and vertical propagation limits—which are not
available currently in SQL or other relational systems—with an example. Suppose
