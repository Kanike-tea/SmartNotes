Divide-and-Conquer

Mergesort

Mergesort is a perfect example of a successful application of the divide-and-
conquer technique. It sorts a given array A[0..n — 1] by dividing it into two halves
A[0..[n/2] — 1] and A[|n/2]..n — 1], sorting each of them recursively, and then
merging the two smaller sorted arrays into a single sorted one.

‘i...
as

The merging of two sorted arrays can be done as follows. Two pointers (array
indices) are initialized to point to the first elements of the arrays being merged.
The elements pointed to are compared, and the smaller of them is added to a new
array being constructed; after that, the index of the smaller element is incremented
to point to its immediate successor in the array it was copied from. This operation
is repeated until one of the two given arrays is exhausted, and then the remaining
elements of the other array are copied to the end of the new array.
