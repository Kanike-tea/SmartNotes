Structured Query Language (SQL)
Introduction

O Commercial database systems use more user friendly language to specify the queries.
im SQL is the most influential commercially marketed product language.

Oo Other commercially used languages are QBE, Quel, and Datalog.
Basic Structure
e The basic structure of an SQL consists of three clauses: select, from and where.
¢ select: it corresponds to the projection operation of relational algebra. Used to list the
attributes desired in the result.
« from: corresponds to the Cartesian product operation of relational algebra. Used to list the
relations to be scanned in the evaluation of the expression
« where: corresponds to the selection predicate of the relational algebra. It consists of a
predicate involving attributes of the relations that appear in the from clause.
e Atypical SQL query has the form:
select Ai, Az,..., An
from r1, 12,..., tm
where P
o Ajrepresents an attribute
© 1 represents a relation
o Pisa predicate
© It is equivalent to following relational algebra expression:
o Haas (o; (T,X ry X...X1,,))
[Note: The words marked in dark in this text work as keywords in SQL language. For example
“select”, “from” and “where” in the above paragraph are shown in bold font to indicate that they
are keywords]
Select Clause
Let us see some simple queries and use of select clause to express them in SQL.
e Find the names of all branches in the Loan relation
select branch-name
from Loan
e By default the select clause includes duplicate values. If we want to force the elimination of
duplicates the inct keyword is used as follows:
select distinct branch-name
from Loan
e The all key word can be used to specify explicitly that duplicates are not removed. Even if
we not use all it means the same so we don’t require all to use in select clause.
select all branch-name
from Loan
e The asterisk “*” can be used to denote “all attributes”. The following SQL statement will
select and all the attributes of Loan.
select *
from Loan

e The arithmetic expressions involving operators, +, -, *, and / are also allowed in select
clause. The following statement will return the amount multiplied by 100 for the rows in
Loan table.
