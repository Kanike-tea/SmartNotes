Database Management System [BCS403]

Result: This insertion violates the referential integrity constraint specified on Dno in
EMPLOYEE because no corresponding referenced tuple exists in DEPARTMENT
with Dnumber = 7.
4. Operation:
Insert <‘Cecilia’, ‘F’, ‘Kolonsky’, “677678989”, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windy Lane,Katy,
TX’, F, 28000, NULL, 4>

Result: This insertion satisfies all constraints, so it is acceptable.

If an insertion violates one or more constraints, the default option is to reject the insertion.It would
be useful if the DBMS could provide a reason to the user as to why the insertion was rejected.

Another option is to an attempt to correct the reason for rejecting the insertion

1.3.2 The Delete Operation
The Delete operation can violate only referential integrity. This occurs if the tuple being deleted is
referenced by foreign keys from other tuples in the database. To specify deletion, a condition on the
attributes of the relation selects the tuple (or tuples) to be deleted,
Examples:
1. Operation:
Delete the WORKS_ON tuple with Essn = *999887777' and Pno =10.
Result: This deletion is acceptable and deletes exactly one tuple.
2. Operation:

Delete the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’.

Result: This deletion is not acceptable, because there are tuples in WORKS_ON that refer
to this tuple. Hence, if the tuple in EMPLOYEE is deleted, referential integrity
violations will result.

3. Operation:
Delete the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = ‘333445555’
Result: This deletion will result in even worse referential integrity violations, because the
tuple involved is referenced by tuples from the EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT,
WORKS_ON, and DEPENDENT relations.
Several options are available if a deletion operation causes a violation
1. restrict - is to reject the deletion
2. cascade, is to attempt to cascade (or propagate) the deletion by deleting tuples that reference

the tuple that is being deleted
