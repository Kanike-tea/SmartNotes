+ A database management system reduces the amount of data duplication by ensuring that a
physical piece of data is available to all programs authorized to have access to it, where as
data written by one program in a file-processing system may not be readable by another
program.

+ A database management system is designed to allow flexible access to data (i.e., queries),
whereas a file-processing system is designed to allow predetermined access to data (i.e.,
compiled programs).

+ A database management system is designed to coordinate multiple users accessing the same
data at the same time. A file-processing system is usually designed to allow one or more
programs to access different data files at the same time. In a file-processing system, a file
can be accessed by two programs concurrently only if both programs have read-only access
to the file.

Que: Explain the difference between physical and logical data independence.

Ans:

* Physical data independence is the ability to modify the physical scheme without making it
necessary to rewrite application programs. Such modifications include changing from
unblocked to blocked record storage, or from sequential to random access files.

+ Logical data independence is the ability to modify the conceptual scheme without making it
necessary to rewrite application programs. Such a modification might be adding a field to a
record; an application program’s view hides this change from the program.

Que: List five responsibilities of a database management system. For each responsibility, explain
the problems that would arise if the responsibility were not discharged.

Ans: A general purpose database manager (DBM) has five responsibilities:

a.

eS aoe

interaction with the file manager.
integrity enforcement.

security enforcement.

backup and recovery.
concurrency control.

If these responsibilities were not met by a given DBM (and the text points out that sometimes a
responsibility is omitted by design, such as concurrency control on a single-user DBM for a micro
computer) the following problems can occur, respectively:

a. No DBM can do without this, if there is no file manager interaction then nothing stored in
the files can be retrieved.

b. Consistency constraints may not be satisfied, when account balances could go below the
minimum allowed, employees could earn too much overtime (e.g.,hours > 80) or, airline
pilots may fly more hours than allowed by law.

c. Unauthorized users may access the database, or users authorized to access part of the
