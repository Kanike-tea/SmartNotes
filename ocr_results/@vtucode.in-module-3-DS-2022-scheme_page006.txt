DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

Insertion into a doubly linked list
Insertion into a doubly linked list is fairly easy. Assume there are two nodes, node
and new node,node may be either a header node or an interior node in a list. The

function dinsert performs the insertion operation in constant time.

void dinsert (nodePointer node, nodePointer newnode)
{/* insert newnode to the right of node */
newnodellink = node;
newnode-rlink = node—rlink;
node>rlink-llink = newnode;
nodesrlink = newnode;

Insertion into a doubly linked circular list

Deletion from a doubly linked list

Deletion from a doubly linked list is equally easy. The function ddelete deletes the
node deletedfrom the list pointed to by node.

To accomplish this deletion, we only need to change the link fields of the nodes
that precede(deleted—llink—rlink) and. follow (deleted—rlink—llink) the node we

want to delete.

void ddelete(nodePointer node, nodePointer deleted)
{/* delete from the donbly linked list */
if {node == deleted)
printf£("Deletion of header node not permitted.\n");
else {
deletedllinkrlink ~ deleted-rlink;
deleted rlink-llink = deleted—llink;
free (deleted) ;
