Program Explanation
* Consider the program for adding a list of n numbers (Figure 2.9).

* The Address of the memory-locations containing the n numbers are symbolically given as
NUMI1, NUM2.....NUMn.

+ Separate Add instruction is used to add each number to the contents of register RO.

+ After all the numbers have been added, the result is placed in memory-location SUM.

BRANCHING
* Consider the task of adding a list of ,,n" numbers (Figure 2.10).
+ Number of entries in the list ,,n" is stored in memory-location N.
+ Register R1 is used as a counter to determine the number of times the loop is executed.
* Content-location N is loaded into register R1 at the beginning of the program.
. The Loop is a straight line sequence of instructions executed as many times as
needed. The loop starts at location LOOP and ends at the instruction Branch>0.
+ During each pass,
— address of the next list entry is determined and
— that entry is fetched and added to RO.
* The instruction Decrement RI reduces the contents of R1 by 1 each time through the loop.
* Then Branch Instruction loads a new value into the program counter. As a result, the
processor fetches and executes the instruction at this new address called the Branch Tar get.
+ A Conditional Branch Instruction causes a branch only if a specified condition is satisfied. If the
condition is not satisfied, the PC is incremented in the normal way, and the next instruction in
sequential address order is fetched and executed.

CONDITION CODES

* The processor keeps track of information about the results of various operations. This is
accomplished by recording the required information in individual bits, called Condition Code
Flags.
* These flags are grouped together in a special processor-register called the condition code register
(or statue register).
+ Four commonly used flags are:

1) N (negative) set to 1 if the result is negative, otherwise cleared to 0.

2) Z (zero) set to 1 if the result is 0; otherwise, cleared to 0.

3) V (overflow) set to 1 if arithmetic overflow occurs; otherwise, cleared to 0.

4) C (carry) set to 1 if a carry-out results from the operation; otherwise cleared to 0.

INDIRECTION AND POINTERS

* Instruction does not give the operand or its address explicitly.
