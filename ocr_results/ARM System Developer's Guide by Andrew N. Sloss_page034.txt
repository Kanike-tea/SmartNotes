2.1 Registers 21

One important feature of the ARM is that register Rm alternatively can be preprocessed
in the barrel shifter before it enters the ALU. Together the barrel shifter and ALU can
calculate a wide range of expressions and addresses.

After passing through the functional units, the result in Rd is written back to the register
file using the Result bus. For load and store instructions the incrementer updates the address
register before the core reads or writes the next register value from or to the next sequential
memory location. The processor continues executing instructions until an exception or
interrupt changes the normal execution flow.

Now that you have an overview of the processor core we'll take a more detailed look
at some of the key components of the processor: the registers, the current program status
register (cpsr), and the pipeline.

2.1 REGISTERS

General-purpose registers hold either data or an address. They are identified with the
letter r prefixed to the register number. For example, register 4 is given the label r4.
