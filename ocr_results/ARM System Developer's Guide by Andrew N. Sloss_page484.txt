CP15 register 5 access permission register formats.

To assign access permission to a region requires a write to a secondary register in
CP15:c5. Secondary registers CP15:c5:c0:0 and CP15:c5:c0:1 configure standard AP, and
secondary registers CP15:c5:c0:2 or CP15:c5:c0:3 configure extended AP. Table 13.6 and
Figure 13.4 show the register’s permission bit assignments for the AP registers.

Processors that support extended permission can also run software written for standard
permission. The type of permission in effect depends on the last write to a CP15 AP register:
If the last written AP register was a standard AP register, then the core is using standard

permission; if the last written AP register was an extended AP register, then the core uses
extended permission. This works because a write to the standard AP registers also updates
the extended AP registers, meaning that the high bits [2:3] of the extended AP region entry
are cleared.
