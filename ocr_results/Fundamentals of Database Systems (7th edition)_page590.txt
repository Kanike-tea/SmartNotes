that work well for certain types of database transactions, such as when a block that
is used most recently is not needed until all the remaining blocks in the relation are
processed.

16.4 Placing File Records on Disk

Data in a database is regarded as a set of records organized into a set of files. In this
section, we define the concepts of records, record types, and files. Then we discuss
techniques for placing file records on disk. Note that henceforth in this chapter we
will be referring to the random access persistent secondary storage as “disk drive” or
“disk.” The disk may be in different forms; for example, magnetic disks with rota-
tional memory or solid-state disks with electronic access and no mechanical delays.

16.4.1 Records and Record Types

Data is usually stored in the form of records. Each record consists of a collection of
related data values or items, where each value is formed of one or more bytes and
corresponds to a particular field of the record. Records usually describe entities and
their attributes. For example, an EMPLOYEE record represents an employee entity,
and each field value in the record specifies some attribute of that employee, such as
Name, Birth_date, Salary, or Supervisor. A collection of field names and their corre-
sponding data types constitutes a record type or record format definition. A data
type, associated with each field, specifies the types of values a field can take.

The data type of a field is usually one of the standard data types used in program-
ming. These include numeric (integer, long integer, or floating point), string of
characters (fixed-length or varying), Boolean (having 0 and 1 or TRUE and FALSE
values only), and sometimes specially coded date and time data types. The number
of bytes required for each data type is fixed for a given computer system. An integer
may require 4 bytes, a long integer 8 bytes, a real number 4 bytes, a Boolean 1 byte,
a date 10 bytes (assuming a format of YYYY-MM-DD), and a fixed-length string of
k characters k bytes. Variable-length strings may require as many bytes as there are
characters in each field value. For example, an EMPLOYEE record type may be
defined—using the C programming language notation—as the following structure:

struct employee{
char name[30];
char ssn[9];
int salary;
int job_code;
char department[20];

In some database applications, the need may arise for storing data items that consist
of large unstructured objects, which represent images, digitized video or audio
streams, or free text. These are referred to as BLOBs (binary large objects). A BLOB
data item is typically stored separately from its record in a pool of disk blocks, and
