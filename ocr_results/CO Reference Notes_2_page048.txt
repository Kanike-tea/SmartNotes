EEPROM (ELECTRICALLY ERASABLE ROM)
« Advantages:
1) It can be both programmed and erased electrically.
2) It allows the erasing of all cell contents selectively.
* Disadvantage: It requires different voltage for erasing, writing and reading the stored data.

FLASH MEMORY

« In EEPROM, it is possible to read & write the contents of a single cell.

In Flash device, it is possible to read contents of a single cell & write entire contents of a block.

¢ Prior to writing, the previous contents of the block are erased.
Eg. In MP3 player, the flash memory stores the data that represents sound.

¢ Single flash chips cannot provide sufficient storage capacity for embedded-system.

« Advantages:
1) Flash drives have greater density which leads to higher capacity & low cost per bit.
2) It requires single power supply voltage & consumes less power.

© There are 2 methods for implementing larger memory: 1) Flash Cards & 2) Flash Drives

1) Flash Cards
> One way of constructing larger module is to mount flash-chips on a small card.
> Such flash-card have standard interface.
> The card is simply plugged into a conveniently accessible slot.
> Memory-size of the card can be 8, 32 or 64MB.
> Eg: A minute of music can be stored in 1MB of memory. Hence 64MB flash cards can store an
hour of music.
2) Flash Drives

> Larger flash memory can be developed by replacing the hard disk-drive.
> The flash drives are designed to fully emulate the hard disk.
> The flash drives are solid state electronic devices that have no movable parts.

Advantages:
1) They have shorter seek & access time which results in faster response.
2) They have low power consumption. .". they are attractive for battery driven
application.
3) They are insensitive to vibration.
Disadvantages:
1) The capacity of flash drive (<1GB) is less than hard disk (>1GB).
2) It leads to higher cost per bit.
3) Flash memory will weaken after it has been written a number of times (typically at
least 1 million times).
