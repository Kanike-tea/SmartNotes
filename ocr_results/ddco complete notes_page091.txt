Determine address of
“Next” number and add
"Next" number to RO

The ,,N“ value is copied to Rand R1 is decremented by 1 each.time in loop. In the loop find the
value of next elemet and add it with)Ro.

In conditional branch instruction, the loop continues by coming out of sequence only if
the condition is true. Here the PC value is set to ,,LLOP* if the condition is true.

Branch > 0 LOOP // if >0 go to LOOP

The PC value is set to LOOP, if the previous statement value is >0 ie. after decrementing R1 value
is greater than 0.

If R1 value is not greater than 0, the PC value is incremented in a mormal sequential way and the
next instruction is executed.

CONDITION CODE BITS

. The processor consists of series of flip-flops to store the status information after ALU
operation.

. It keeps track of the results of various operations, for subsequent usage.

. The series of flip-flip-flops used to store the status and control information of the processor
is called as “Condition Code Register”. It defines 4 flags. The format of condition code register
is as follows.
