1.3 Embedded System Hardware 11

Flash ROM can be written to as well as read, but it is slow to write so you shouldn’t use
it for holding dynamic data. Its main use is for holding the device firmware or storing long-
term data that needs to be preserved after power is off. The erasing and writing of flahh ROM
are completely software controlled with no additional hardware circuity required, which
reduces the manufacturing costs. Flash ROM has become the most popular of the read-only
memory types and is currently being used as an alternative for mass or secondary storage.

Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) is the most commonly used RAM for devices.
It has the lowest cost per megabyte compared with other types of RAM. DRAM is dynamic—
it needs to have its storage cells refreshed and given a new electronic charge every few
milliseconds, so you need to set up a DRAM controller before using the memory.

Static random access memory (SRAM) is faster than the more traditional DRAM, but
requires more silicon area. SRAM is static—the RAM does not require refreshing. The
access time for SRAM is considerably shorter than the equivalent DRAM because SRAM.
does not require a pause between data accesses. Because of its higher cost, it is used mostly
for smaller high-speed tasks, such as fast memory and caches.

Synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) is one of many subcategories
of DRAM. It can run at much higher clock speeds than conventional memory. SDRAM
synchronizes itself with the processor bus because it is clocked. Internally the data is fetched
from memory cells, pipelined, and finally brought out on the bus in a burst. The old-style
DRAM is asynchronous, so does not burst as efficiently as SDRAM.

1.3.4 PERIPHERALS

Embedded systems that interact with the outside world need some form of peripheral
device. A peripheral device performs input and output functions for the chip by connecting
to other devices or sensors that are off-chip. Each peripheral device usually performs a single
function and may reside on-chip. Peripherals range from a simple serial communication
device to a more complex 802.11 wireless device.

All ARM peripherals are memory mapped—the programming interface is a set of
memory-addressed registers. The address of these registers is an offset from a specific
peripheral base address.

Controllers are specialized peripherals that implement higher levels of functionality
within an embedded system. Two important types of controllers are memory controllers
and interrupt controllers.

1.3.4.1 Memory Controllers

Memory controllers connect different types of memory to the processor bus. On power-up
amemory controller is configured in hardware to allow certain memory devices to be active.
‘These memory devices allow the initialization code to be executed. Some memory devices
must be set up by software; for example, when using DRAM, you first have to set up the
memory timings and refresh rate before it can be accessed.
