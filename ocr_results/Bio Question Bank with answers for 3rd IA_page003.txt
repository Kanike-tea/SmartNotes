infections based on chest scans and even cough sounds. In neurology, AI assists in identifying
signs of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases by analyzing brain scans and behavioral
patterns.

The benefits of using AI in disease diagnosis are numerous. It provides faster and often more
accurate results, helps reduce the workload of healthcare professionals, and can function
continuously without fatigue. AI tools are also helpful in rural or remote areas where access to
expert doctors is limited. Furthermore, they support younger or less experienced doctors with
expert-level diagnostic suggestions. However, there are several challenges as well. AI systems
require high-quality and well-labeled data for training, which is not always available. Some AI
models work as "black boxes," meaning they provide results without explaining how they
arrived at them, which reduces trust among doctors and patients. Privacy and ethical issues are
also a concern, as handling sensitive patient data must comply with legal regulations.
Additionally, integrating AI into existing hospital systems and training staff to use them can be
difficult.

Some popular AI tools in the medical field include IBM Watson, which supports cancer
diagnosis and treatment planning; Google DeepMind, known for detecting eye diseases and
predicting protein structures; PathAI, which helps in analyzing pathology slides; and Zebra
Medical Vision, which scans radiology images for early disease detection.

The future of AI in healthcare is promising. AI will be increasingly used in wearable health
devices like smartwatches to monitor patients in real time. It may assist in robotic surgeries,
mobile-based diagnostic apps, and creating more explainable and user-friendly AI systems. As
future engineers and healthcare professionals, students must understand the potential of AI and
be prepared to collaborate in building safe, ethical, and effective Al-powered healthcare
systems.

3. The structure and design of the Kingfisher's beak led to the design of the bullet trains.
Explain.

Ans. The kingfisher beak is an excellent example of nature's design for efficient diving and
fishing. Its unique shape and structure enable the kingfisher to minimize the impact of water
resistance and achieve a successful dive.

The Physics behind the Kingfisher Beak
Streamlining:

The beak of a kingfisher is long, slender, and sharply pointed, which helps reduce drag or air
resistance as the bird dives into the water. The streamlined shape allows the kingfisher to
smoothly cut through the air and minimize the energy required for the dive.

Surface Tension:

When the kingfisher hits the water, it encounters the resistance caused by surface tension.
Surface tension is the cohesive force between water molecules that creates a "skin" on the
water's surface. The sharp beak of the kingfisher helps to pierce through the water's surface,
breaking the surface tension and reducing the force required to enter the water.
