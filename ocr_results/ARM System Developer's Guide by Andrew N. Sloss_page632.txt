A.3 Alphabetical List of ARM and Thumb Instructions 619

2. TST<cond> Rn, Rm {, <shift>} ARMV1
3. TST Ln, Lm THUMBV1
Action

1. Set the cpsr on the result of (Rn & <rotated_immed>)
2. Set the cpsr on the result of (Rn & <shifted_Rm>)

3. Set the cpsr on the result of (Ln & Lm)

Notes

The cpsr is updated: N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>, C = <shifter_C> (see Table A.3).
If Rn or Rmis pc, then the value used is the address of the instruction plus eight bytes.

Use this instruction to test whether a selected set of bits are all zero.

Example
TST v0, #0xFF ; test if the bottom 8 bits of rO are 0
UADD Unsigned parallel modulo add (see the entry for SADD)
UHADD Unsigned halving add and subtract (see the entry for SHAD)
UHSUB
UMAAL. Unsigned multiply accumulate accumulate long

1. UMAAL<cond> RdLo, RdHi, Rm, Rs ARMV6
Action
1. RdHi:RdLo = (unsigned)Rm*Rs + (unsigned)RdLo + (unsigned)RdHi
Notes

RdHi and RdLo must be different registers.
RdHi, RdLo, Rm, Rs must not be pe.

This operation cannot overflow because (232 — 1)(22 — 1) + (27 — 1) + (2% —1) =
(26 — 1). You can use it to synthesize the multiword multiplications used by public
key cryptosystems.
