UNION, INTERSECTION and SET DIFFERENCE are binary operations; that is, each is applied to
two sets (of tuples). When these operations are adapted to relational databases, the two relations on
which any of these three operations are applied must have the same type of tuples; this condition has
been called union compatibility or type compatibility.

Two relations R(Ai, Ao, ..., An) and S(Bi, Bos...., Bn) are said to be union compatible (or type

compatible) if they have the same degree n and if dom(Ai) = dom(B)) for 1 <i < n.This means that
the two relations have the same number of attributes and each corresponding pair of attributes has
the same domain.

Both UNION and INTERSECTION are commutative operations; that is,
RUS=SURandRNS=SOR

Both UNION and INTERSECTION can be treated as n-ary operations applicable to any number of
relations because both are also associative operations; that is,

RU(SUT)=(RUS)UTand(RNS)NT=RN(SNT)
The MINUS operation is not commutative; that is, in general,
R-S#S-R
INTERSECTION can be expressed in terms of union and set difference as follows:
RNS=(RUS)-(R-S))-(S—R)

In SQL, there are three operations—UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT—that correspond to the
set operations
