LECTURE-13: INDEX
Types of Indexes:

e Indexing mechanisms used to speed up access to desired data.
o E.g., author catalog in library
e Search Key - attribute to set of attributes used to look up records in a file.
e An index file consists of records (called index entries) of the form
e Index files are typically much smaller than the original file
« Two basic kinds of indices:
o Ordered indices: search keys are stored in sorted order
o Hash indices: search keys are distributed uniformly across “buckets” using a “hash
function”.

Ordered Indices
Indexing techniques evaluated on basis of:
1. In an ordered index, index entries are stored sorted on the search key value. E.g.,
author catalog in library.
2. Primary index: ina sequentially ordered file, the index whose search key specifies the
sequential order of the file.
a. Also called clustering index
b. The search key of a primary index is usually but not necessarily the primary key.
3. Secondary index: an index whose search key specifies an order different from the
sequential order of the file. Also called
non-clustering index.
4. Index-sequential file: ordered sequential file with a primary index.

There are two types of ordered indices that we can use:
Dense index:
An index record appears for every search-key value in the file. In a dense primary index, the index
record contains the search-key value and a pointer to the first data record with that search-key
value. The rest of the records with the same search key-value would be stored sequentially after the
first record, since, because the index is a primary one, records are sorted on the same search key.
Dense index implementations may store a list of pointers to all records with the same search-key
value; doing so is not essential for primary indices.

Sparse index:

An index record appears for only some of the search-key values. As is true in dense indices, each
index record contains a search-key value and a pointer to the first data record with that search-key
value. To locate a record, we find the index entry with the largest search-key value that is less than
or equal to the search-key value for which we are looking. We start at the record pointed to by that
index entry, and follow the pointers in the file until we find the desired record.

Primary Indexes:
A primary index is an ordered file whose records are of fixed length with two fields. The first field

is of the same data types as the ordering key filed of the data file and the second field is a pointer to
a disk block- a block address. The ordering key field is called the primary key of the data file. There
