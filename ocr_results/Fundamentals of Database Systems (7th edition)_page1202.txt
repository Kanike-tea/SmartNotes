values in those columns for our result. The constants specify values that must be
exactly matched in those columns.

For example, consider the query QO: Retrieve the birth date and address of John B.
Smith. In Figures C.2(a) through C.2(d) we show how this query can be specified in
a progressively more terse form in QBE. In Figure C.2(a) an example of an employee
is presented as the type of row that we are interested in. By leaving John B. Smith as
constants in the Fname, Minit, and Lname columns, we are specifying an exact match
in those columns. The rest of the columns are preceded by an underscore indicating
that they are domain variables (example elements). The P. prefix is placed in the
Bdate and Address columns to indicate that we would like to output value(s) in those
columns.

Q0 can be abbreviated as shown in Figure C.2(b). There is no need to specify exam-
ple values for columns in which we are not interested. Moreover, because example
values are completely arbitrary, we can just specify variable names for them, as
shown in Figure C.2(c). Finally, we can also leave out the example values entirely, as
shown in Figure C.2(d), and just specify a P. under the columns to be retrieved.

To see how retrieval queries in QBE are similar to the domain relational calculus,
compare Figure C.2(d) with Qo (simplified) in domain calculus as follows:

Qo : { uv | EMPLOYEE(qrstuvwxyz) and q=‘John’ and r="B’ and s=‘Smith’}
