18.3 Algorithms for SELECT Operation

The minimum number of main memory buffers needed is ng = 3, which gives a diy
of 2 and an np of| (b/3) |. The minimum dy of 2 gives the worst-case performance
of the algorithm, which is:

(2 * b) + (2+ (6 (logs np))).

The following sections discuss the various algorithms for the operations of the rela-
tional algebra (see Chapter 8).

18.3 Algorithms for SELECT Operation

18.3.1 Implemention Options for the SELECT Operation

There are many algorithms for executing a SELECT operation, which is basically a
search operation to locate the records in a disk file that satisfy a certain condition.
Some of the search algorithms depend on the file having specific access paths, and
they may apply only to certain types of selection conditions. We discuss some of the
algorithms for implementing SELECT in this section. We will use the following oper-
ations, specified on the relational database in Figure 5.5, to illustrate our discussion:

OP1: Gen = "123456789" (EMPLOYEE)

OP2: Gpnumber » s (DEPARTMENT)

OP3: Opno= 5 (EMPLOYEE)

OP4: Opno= 5 AND Salary > 30000 AND Sex = ‘f (EMPLOYEE)
OPS: Oxssn = ‘123456789 AND Pao =10(WORKS_ON)

OP6: An SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dno IN (3,27, 49)

OP7: An SQL Query (from Section 17.5.3)

SELECT First_name, Lname

FROM Employee

WHERE ((Salary*Commission_pct) + Salary ) > 15000;

Search Methods for Simple Selection. A number of search algorithms are pos-
sible for selecting records from a file. These are also known as file scans, because
they scan the records of a file to search for and retrieve records that satisfy a selection
condition.’ If the search algorithm involves the use of an index, the index search is
called an index scan. The following search methods ($1 through S6) are examples of
some of the search algorithms that can be used to implement a select operation:

= $1—Linear search (brute force algorithm). Retrieve every record in the file,
and test whether its attribute values satisfy the selection condition. Since the

7A selection operation is sometimes called a filter, since it filters out the records in the file that do not
satisfy the selection condition.
