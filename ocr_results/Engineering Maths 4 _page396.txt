SAMPLING THEORY 387

We compute t =:=

‘:@ Student's t. test for a sample mean

mat "We need-to-test the hypothesis, whether the sample mean (x) differs significantly
‘i from the population mean (1) / hypothetical value (1).

-F Vn. and consider ||. °

We also take a note of the value of f for'the given d-f from the table of standard

values.

If ltl > to5 the difference between x and Lt is said to be significant at 5% level of
significance. *

If ltl > Eni. the difference is said to be significant at 1% level of significance.

If | ¢ 1 is less than the table value at a certain level of significance, the data is said to

‘+ be conformal / consistent with the hypothesis that 1 is the mean of the population.

¢ ‘Confidence limits for the population mean

_ if tos is the tabulated value of t for (n—1)d-f at 5% level of significance, it

implies that.
