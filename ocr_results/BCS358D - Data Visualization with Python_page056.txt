LAB PROGRAM 05 (b)

5 b) Write a Python program to Demonstrate how to Draw a Pie Chart using Matplotlib.

Aim: Demonstration of how to draw a Pie chart using Matplotlib.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION
The below program demonstrates how to draw a Pie chart using Matplotlib. Make sure you have

Matplotlib installed before running this code. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

pip install matplotlib

1. ‘import matplotlib.pyplot as plt’: This line imports the ‘matplotlib.pyplot’ module and
assigns it the alias ‘plt’. This module provides a collection of functions for creating
various types of plots and charts.

2. Sample data for the pie chart:

‘labels’: A list containing labels for each category or segment of the pie chart.
e ‘sizes’: A list containing the sizes or values for each category. These values
represent the proportions of each category in the whole pie.
e ‘colors’: A list of colors to be used for each category. In this case, four colors are
defined: gold, lightcoral, lightgreen, and lightskyblue.
e ‘explode’: A tuple that specifies whether to "explode" a slice of the pie chart.
When a value is greater than 0, it separates that particular slice from the rest of the
chart. In this code, explode is set to ‘(0.1, 0,0, 0)’, which means that the first slice
(Category A) will be slightly separated from the rest.
3. Creating the pie chart:
e ‘plt.pie()’: This function is used to create the pie chart. It takes several arguments,
including ‘sizes’ (the data values), ‘explode’ (to specify exploding slices), ‘labels’
(the labels for each category), ‘colors’ (the colors for each slice), ‘autopct’ (a
string specifying how to display the percentage values on the chart), and
‘startangle’ (the angle at which the first slice starts in degrees).
4. Adding a title:
e ‘plt.title()’: This function is used to set a title for the pie chart. In this code, the
title is set to 'Pie Chart Example'.

5. Displaying the plot:
