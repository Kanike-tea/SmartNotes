Database System Concepts
and Architecture

‘Tis architecture of DBMS packages has evolved
from the early monolithic systems, where the whole
DBMS software package was one tightly integrated system, to the modern DBMS
packages that are modular in design, with a client/server system architecture. The
recent growth in the amount of data requiring storage has led to database systems
with distributed architectures comprised of thousands of computers that manage
the data stores. This evolution mirrors the trends in computing, where large cen-
tralized mainframe computers are replaced by hundreds of distributed worksta-
tions and personal computers connected via communications networks to various
types of server machines—Web servers, database servers, file servers, application
servers, and so on. The current cloud computing environments consist of thou-
sands of large servers managing so-called big data for users on the Web.

Ina basic client/server DBMS architecture, the system functionality is distributed
between two types of modules.’ A client module is typically designed so that it
will run on a mobile device, user workstation, or personal computer (PC). Typi-
cally, application programs and user interfaces that access the database run in the
client module. Hence, the client module handles user interaction and provides
the user-friendly interfaces such as apps for mobile devices, or forms- or menu-
based GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for PCs. The other kind of module, called
a server module, typically handles data storage, access, search, and other func-
tions. We discuss client/server architectures in more detail in Section 2.5. First,
we must study more basic concepts that will give us a better understanding of
modern database architectures.

‘As we shall see in Section 2.5, there are variations on this simple two-tier client/server architecture.
