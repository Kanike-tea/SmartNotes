JOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS . ; 343
© Expectation, Variance, Covariance and Correlation
If X isadiscrete random variable. taking values x, , X, +**x, having probability

function f (x) then the Expectation of X denoted by E(X)or Hy is defined by the
relation

Hy = E(X) = ue or Xx f(x)

' The Variance of X denoted by V(X) is defined by the relation

n
V(x) = B (xn) f(x) = E[ (Xn? ]
‘j=1
where pt is the meanof X.
Oy = W(X) is called the standard deviation (S.D) of X.

If X and Y are two discrete random variables having the joint probability function
f(%, y) then the Expectations of X and Y are defined as follows.

My = E(X) = DL x f(x,y) = E x, f(x)

If Z = 6(X, Y) and f(x, y) is the joint distribution of X and Y, the
Expectation of Z inthe joint distribution of X, Y is defined by the relation

E(Z)= EE O(a, yi) hj

If X and Y are random variables having mean py and Hy respectively, then the

covariance of X and Y denoted by COV(X, Y) is defined by the relation
~ COV(X, Y) = EE (x,-py) (Yj By) Jj

= E[(X~ny) (Y-Hy)]
Equivalently we have,
COV(X, Y)= EE x, yj Jig Bx Hy = E(XY)-hy by

. Further, the Correlation of X and Y denoted by p(X, Y) isdefined by the relation
