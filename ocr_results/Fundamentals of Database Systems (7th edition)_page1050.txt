Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

whereas Levesque (1984) provides a discussion of incomplete knowledge in light of
logic. Gallaire and Minker (1978) provide an early book on this topic. A detailed
treatment of logic and databases appears in Ullman (1989, Volume 2), and there is
a related chapter in Volume 1 (1988). Ceri, Gottlob, and Tanca (1990) present a
comprehensive yet concise treatment of logic and databases. Das (1992) is a com-
prehensive book on deductive databases and logic programming. The early history
of Datalog is covered in Maier and Warren (1988). Clocksin and Mellish (2003) is
an excellent reference on Prolog language.

Aho and Ullman (1979) provide an early algorithm for dealing with recursive queries,
using the least fixed-point operator. Bancilhon and Ramakrishnan (1986) give an
excellent and detailed description of the approaches to recursive query processing,
with detailed examples of the naive and seminaive approaches. Excellent survey arti-
cles on deductive databases and recursive query processing include Warren (1992)
and Ramakrishnan and Ullman (1995). A complete description of the seminaive
approach based on relational algebra is given in Bancilhon (1985). Other approaches
to recursive query processing include the recursive query/subquery strategy of Vieille
(1986), which is a top-down interpreted strategy, and the Henschen-Naqvi (1984)
top-down compiled iterative strategy. Balbin and Ramamohanrao (1987) discuss an
extension of the seminaive differential approach for multiple predicates.

The original paper on magic sets is by Bancilhon et al. (1986). Beeri and Ramakrish-
nan (1987) extend it. Mumick et al. (1990a) show the applicability of magic sets to
nonrecursive nested SQL queries. Other approaches to optimizing rules without
rewriting them appear in Vieille (1986, 1987). Kifer and Lozinskii (1986) propose a
different technique. Bry (1990) discusses how the top-down and bottom-up
approaches can be reconciled. Whang and Navathe (1992) describe an extended
disjunctive normal form technique to deal with recursion in relational algebra
expressions for providing an expert system interface over a relational DBMS.

Chang (1981) describes an early system for combining deductive rules with rela-
tional databases. The LDL system prototype is described in Chimenti et al. (1990).
Krishnamurthy and Naqvi (1989) introduce the choice notion in LDL. Zaniolo
(1988) discusses the language issues for the LDL system. A language overview of
CORAL is provided in Ramakrishnan et al. (1992), and the implementation is
described in Ramakrishnan et al. (1993). An extension to support object-oriented
features, called CORAL++, is described in Srivastava et al. (1993). Ullman (1985)
provides the basis for the NAIL! system, which is described in Morris et al. (1987).
Phipps et al. (1991) describe the GLUE-NAIL! deductive database system.

Zaniolo (1990) reviews the theoretical background and the practical importance of
deductive databases. Nicolas (1997) gives an excellent history of the developments
leading up to deductive object-oriented database (DOOD) systems. Falcone et al.
(1997) survey the DOOD landscape. References on the VALIDITY system include
Friesen et al. (1995), Vieille (1998), and Dietrich et al. (1999).
