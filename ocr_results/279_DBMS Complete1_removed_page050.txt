Figure 12.23 Hash index on search key account-number of account file.

We use the term hash index to denote hash file structures as well as secondary hash indices. Strictly
speaking, hash indices are only secondary index structures. A hash index is never needed as a
primary index structure, since, if a file itself is organized by hashing, there is no need for a separate
hash index structure on it. However, since hash file organization provides the same direct access to
records that indexing provides, we pretend that a file organized by hashing also has a primary hash
index on it.
Advantages of hashing:

1. Exact key matches are extremely quick

2. Hashing is very good long keys, or those with multiple columns, provided the complete key

value is provided for the query
3. This organization usually allows for the allocation of disk space so a good deal of disk
management is possible
4. No disk space is used by this indexing method

Disadvantages of hashing:
1. It becomes difficult to predict overflow because the working of the hashing algorithm will
not be visible to the DBA
2. No sorting of data occurs either physically or logically so sequential access is poor
3. This organization usually takes a lot of disk space to ensure that no overflow occurs.
