e Energy storage: Lipids are a major source of stored energy in the body, and they can
be broken down to release energy when it is needed.

e Insulation: Lipids help to insulate the body, helping to regulate temperature and
protect against heat loss.

e Cell membrane structure: Lipids are a major component of cell membranes, helping
to maintain their fluidity and stability.

e Hormone synthesis: Some lipids, such as cholesterol, are precursors to hormones, and
are necessary for their production.

e Transport: Lipids are soluble in fat, but not in water. This makes them ideal for
carrying fat soluble vitamins and other lipophilic compounds through the

bloodstream.

There are several types of lipids, including saturated and unsaturated fats,
phospholipids, and steroids. It is important to have a balanced diet that includes a moderate
amount of healthy lipids, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, while limiting the
intake of saturated and trans fats. This can help to maintain overall health and reduce the risk

of chronic diseases such as heart disease and stroke.

Properties and Functions of Lipids

Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic biomolecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids,
steroids, and waxes. They play essential roles in energy storage, cell membrane structure, and

signalling.

1. Properties of Lipids
A. Physical Properties

¢ Insolubility in Water: Lipids are hydrophobic and do not dissolve in water but are
soluble in organic solvents (e.g., chloroform, ether, benzene).
¢ Lower Density: Lipids are less dense than water, allowing fats and oils to float.
e Varied Melting Points:
o Saturated fats (e.g., butter) have higher melting points and are solid at room
temperature.
o Unsaturated fats (e.g., vegetable oils) have lower melting points and are liquid
at room temperature.

e Greasy or Oily Texture: Lipids have a slippery feel due to their hydrophobic nature.
