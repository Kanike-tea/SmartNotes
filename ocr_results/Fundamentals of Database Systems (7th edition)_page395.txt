language ODL. Section 12.4 presents an overview of the database design process for
object databases. Section 12.5 discusses the object query language (OQL), which is
part of the ODMG 3.0 standard. In Section 12.6, we discuss programming language
bindings, which specify how to extend object-oriented programming languages to
include the features of the object database standard. Section 12.7 summarizes the
chapter. Sections 12.3 through 12.6 may be left out if a less thorough introduction
to object databases is desired.

12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts

12.1.1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts and Features

The term object-oriented—abbreviated OO or O-O—has its origins in OO pro-
gramming languages, or OOPLs. Today OO concepts are applied in the areas of
databases, software engineering, knowledge bases, artificial intelligence, and
computer systems in general. OOPLs have their roots in the SIMULA language,
which was proposed in the late 1960s. The programming language Smalltalk,
developed at Xerox PARC* in the 1970s, was one of the first languages to explic-
itly incorporate additional OO concepts, such as message passing and inheri-
tance. It is known as a pure OO programming language, meaning that it was
explicitly designed to be object-oriented. This contrasts with hybrid OO pro-
gramming languages, which incorporate OO concepts into an already existing
language. An example of the latter is C++, which incorporates OO concepts into
the popular C programming language.

An object typically has two components: state (value) and behavior (operations). It
can have a complex data structure as well as specific operations defined by the pro-
grammer. Objects in an OOPL exist only during program execution; therefore,
they are called transient objects. An OO database can extend the existence of objects
so that they are stored permanently in a database, and hence the objects become
persistent objects that exist beyond program termination and can be retrieved later
and shared by other programs. In other words, OO databases store persistent
objects permanently in secondary storage and allow the sharing of these objects
among multiple programs and applications. This requires the incorporation of
other well-known features of database management systems, such as indexing
mechanisms to efficiently locate the objects, concurrency control to allow object
sharing among concurrent programs, and recovery from failures. An OO database
system will typically interface with one or more OO programming languages to
provide persistent and shared object capabilities.

The internal structure of an object in OOPLs includes the specification of instance
variables, which hold the values that define the internal state of the object. An
instance variable is similar to the concept of an aftribute in the relational model,

SObjects have many other characteristics, as we discuss in the rest of this chapter.
