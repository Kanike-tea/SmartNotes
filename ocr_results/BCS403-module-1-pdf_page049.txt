« Another naming consideration involves choosing binary relationship names to make the ER

diagram of the schema readable from left to right and from top to bottom.

3.6.3 Design Choices for ER Conceptual Design

In general, the schema design process should be considered an iterative refinement process, where
an initial design is created and then iteratively refined until the most suitable design is reached.
Some of the refinements that are often used include the following:
= A concept may be first modeled as an attribute and then refined into a relationship because
it is determined that the attribute is a reference to another entity type. It.is.often the case
that a pair of such attributes that are inverses of one another are refined into a binary
relationship.
= Similarly, an attribute that exists in several entity types may, be elevated or promoted to an
independent entity type. For example, suppose that several entity types in a UNIVERSITY
database, such as STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, and COURSE, each has an attribute
Department in the initial design; the designer may then choose to create an entity type
DEPARTMENT with a single attribute Dept_name and relate it to the three entity types
(STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, and COURSE) via appropriate relationships.
= An inverse refinement to the previous case may be applied—for example, if an entity type
DEPARTMENT exists in the initial design with a single attribute Dept_name and is related
to only one other entity type, STUDENT. In this case, DEPARTMENT may be reduced or
demoted to an attribute of STUDENT.

3.6.4 Alternative Notations for ER Diagrams

There are many alternative diagrammatic notations for displaying ER diagrams. One alternative
ER notation for specifying structural constraints on relationships, which replaces the cardinality
ratio (1:1, 1:N, M:N) and single/double line notation for participation constraints. This notation
involves associating a pair of integer numbers (min, max) with each participation of an entity type
E ina relationship type R, where 0 < min < max and max > 1.

The numbers mean that for each entity e in E, e must participate in at least min and at most max
relationship instances in R at any point in time. In this method, min = 0 implies partial

participation, whereas min > 0 implies total participation.
