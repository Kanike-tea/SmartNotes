Microcontrollers-BCS402

The operating system provides an infrastructure to control applications and manage hardware
system resources. Many embedded systems do not require a full operating system but merely
a simple task scheduler that is either event or poll driven.

The device drivers are the third component shown in Figure 6.1. They provide a consistent
software interface to the peripherals on the hardware device.

Finally, an application performs one of the tasks required for a device. For example, a mobile
phone might have a diary application. There may be multiple applications running on the
same device, controlled by the operating system.

The software components can run from ROM or RAM. ROM code that is fixed on the device

(for example, the initialization code) is called firmware.

5.1 Initialization (Boot) Code
Initialization code (or boot code) takes the processor from the reset state to a state where the
operating system can run. It usually configures the memory controller and processor caches
and initializes some devices. In a simple system the operating system might be replaced by a
simple scheduler or debug monitor.
The initialization code handles a number of administrative tasks prior to handing control over
to an operating system image. This can be grouped into three different tasks:

i) Initial hardware configuration

ii) Diagnostics

iii) Booting.
Initial hardware configuration involves setting up the target platform so it can boot an
image. Although the target platform itself comes up in a standard configuration, this
configuration normally requires modification to satisfy the requirements of the booted image.
For example, the memory system normally requires reorganization of the memory map.
Example: Initializing or organizing memory is an important part of the initialization code

because many operating systems expect a known memory layout before they can start.
