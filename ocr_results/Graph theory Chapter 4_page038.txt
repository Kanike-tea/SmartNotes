In this graph, the set M, = {e1, e4, eg} isa matching but not a complete matching from V; to
V2; because this matching does not include all the vertices of V,. But the set Mz = {e}, €3, e5,¢s)

is a matching which is a complete matching from V, and V>. This complete matching is shown
separately in Figure 4.62,
