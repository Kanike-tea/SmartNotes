26.5 Introduction to Deductive Databases

example, consider the interpretation in Figure 26.13, and assume that the SUPERVISE
predicate is defined by a set of known facts, whereas the SUPERIOR predicate is
defined as an interpretation (model) for the rules. Suppose that we add the predi-
cate SUPERIOR(james, bob) to the true predicates. This remains a model for the
rules shown, but it is not a minimal model, since changing the truth value of
SUPERIOR(james,bob) from true to false still provides us with a model for the rules.
The model shown in Figure 26.13 is the minimal model for the set of facts that are
defined by the SUPERVISE predicate.

In general, the minimal model that corresponds to a given set of facts in the model-
theoretic interpretation should be the same as the facts generated by the proof-theoretic
interpretation for the same original set of ground and deductive axioms. However, this
is generally true only for rules with a simple structure. Once we allow negation in the
specification of rules, the correspondence between interpretations does not hold. In
fact, with negation, numerous minimal models are possible for a given set of facts.

A third approach to interpreting the meaning of rules involves defining an inference
mechanism that is used by the system to deduce facts from the rules. This inference
mechanism would define a computational interpretation to the meaning of the
rules. The Prolog logic programming language uses its inference mechanism to define
the meaning of the rules and facts in a Prolog program. Not all Prolog programs cor-
respond to the proof-theoretic or model-theoretic interpretations; it depends on the
type of rules in the program. However, for many simple Prolog programs, the Prolog
inference mechanism infers the facts that correspond either to the proof-theoretic
interpretation or to a minimal model under the model-theoretic interpretation.

26.5.6 Datalog Programs and Their Safety

There are two main methods of defining the truth values of predicates in actual
Datalog programs. Fact-defined predicates (or relations) are defined by listing all
the combinations of values (the tuples) that make the predicate true. These corre-
spond to base relations whose contents are stored in a database system. Figure 26.14
shows the fact-defined predicates EMPLOYEE, MALE, FEMALE, DEPARTMENT,
SUPERVISE, PROJECT, and WORKS_ON, which correspond to part of the relational
database shown in Figure 5.6. Rule-defined predicates (or views) are defined by
being the head (LHS) of one or more Datalog rules; they correspond to virtual rela-
tions whose contents can be inferred by the inference engine. Figure 26.15 shows a
number of rule-defined predicates.

A program or a rule is said to be safe if it generates a finite set of facts. The general
theoretical problem of determining whether a set of rules is safe is undecidable.
However, one can determine the safety of restricted forms of rules. For example, the
rules shown in Figure 26.16 are safe. One situation where we get unsafe rules that
can generate an infinite number of facts arises when one of the variables in the rule
can range over an infinite domain of values, and that variable is not limited to rang-
ing over a finite relation. For example, consider the following rule:

BIG_SALARY(Y) :— Y>60000
