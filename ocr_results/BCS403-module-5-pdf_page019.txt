Figure 22.7 A granularity hierarchy for illustrating multiple granularity level locking

= To make multiple granularity level locking practical, additional types of locks, called
intention locks, are needed

= The idea behind intention locks is for’a transaction to indicate, along the path from the root
to the desired node, what type of lock (shared or exclusive) it will require from one of the
node’s descendants.

= There are three types of intention locks:

1. Intention-shared (IS) indicates that one or more shared locks will be requested on some

descendant node(s).

2. Intention-exclusive (IX) indicates that one or more exclusive locks will be requested on
some descendant node(s).

3. Shared-intention-exclusive (SIX) indicates that the current node is locked in shared
mode but that one or more exclusive locks will be requested on some descendant
node(s).

= The compatibility table of the three intention locks, and the shared and exclusive locks, is
shown in Figure 22.8.
