DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

3. Postorder: Postorder traversal calls for moving down the tree towards the left until you
can go no further. Then move to the right node and then visit the node and continue.

Recursion function:
The Postorder traversal of a binary tree can be recursively defined as

+ Traverse the left subtree in postorder.

+ Traverse the right subtree in postorder.

¢ Visit the root

void postorder (treepointerptr)
{
if (ptr)
{
postorder
(ptr-leftchild);
postorder
(ptr-rightchild);
printf
“$da",ptrodata) ;
}

4. Iterative inorder Traversal:

Iterative inorder traversal explicitly make use of stack function.

The left nodes are pushed. into stack until a null node is reached, the node is then remove:
from the stackand displayed, and the node’s right child is stacked until a null node is reached.
The traversal then continues with, the left child. The traversal is complete when the stack is
empty.

void Yterfnorder (treePointer node)

{

int top = -1; /* initialize stack */
treePointer stack [MAX—STACK-—SIZE};
for (33) 1

for(; node; node = node—leftChild)
push(node); /* add to stack */

node =~ pop(); /* delete from stack */

if (!node) break; /* empty stack */

printf("%da", node—rdata);

node = node-rightChild;
