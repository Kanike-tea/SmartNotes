Computers as its leaves and the internal vertices, other than the root, as ex! enaion Cords,
"Then the number of leaves in the tree is p = 10. Therefore, the number of intemal vertices
in the tree is g = p-1 = 10-1 =9, Accordingly, the number of extension cords needed
(namely the number of internal vertices minus the root) is q—- 1 = 8. (See Figure 3.10 for
illustration). ;
