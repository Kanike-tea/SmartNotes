main memory block has to be placed in particular
cache block number by using below formula
Cache block number=main memory block number
% number of blocks present in cache memory.

For eg: main memory block 129 has to be placed in
cache block number | by using above formula i.e
Cache block number=129 % 128 (consider
remainder that is 1).
Cache block number=258 % 128 (consider
remainder that is 2).
Main memory block 258 has to be placed in cache
block 2

Block — Word

[7a] Main memory adress

e¢ The main memory block is loaded into cache block by means of memory address. The main memory
address consists of 3 fields as shown in the figure.
. Each block consists of 16 words. Hence least significant 4 bits are used to select one of the 16

words.

e The 7bits of memory address are used to specify the position of the cache block, location. The most
significant 5 bits of the memory address are stored in the tag bits. The tag bits are used to map one of
2° = 32 blocks into cache block location (tag bit has value 0-31).
. The higher order 5 bits of memory address are compared with the tag bits associated with cache
location. If they match, then the desired word is in that block of the cache.

e If there is no match, then the block containing the required word must first be read from the main memory
