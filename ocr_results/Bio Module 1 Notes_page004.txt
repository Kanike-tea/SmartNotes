mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is termed as the asexual reproduction where the parent
cell divides to form daughter cells. Meiosis causes the daughter cells to be genetically

different from the parent cells.

Thus, we can understand why cells are known as the structural and functional unit of life. This is
because they are responsible for providing structure to the organisms and perform several functions

necessary for carrying out life’s processes.
Stem cells and their application:
What are Stem Cells?

Stem cells also have the ability to repair damaged cells. These cells have strong healing power.

They can evolve into any type of cell.

Research on stem cells is going on, and it is believed that stem cell therapies can cure ailments like

paralysis and Alzheimer’s as well.
Types of cells
Stem cells are of the following different types:

« Embryonic Stem Cells

Adult Stem Cells

Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

« Mesenchymal stem cells

1. Embryonic Stem Cells:

The fertilized egg begins to divide immediately. All the cells in the young embryo are
totipotent cells. These cells form a hollow structure within a few days. Cells in one region
group together to form the inner cell mass. This contains pluripotent cells that make up the

developing foetus.

The embryonic stem cells can be further classified as:
a. Totipotent Stem Cells: These can differentiate into all possible types of stem cells.

b. Pluripotent Stem Cells: These are the cells from an early embryo and can differentiate into
