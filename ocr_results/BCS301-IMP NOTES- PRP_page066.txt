Confidence Inter vals:
Suppose we want to estimate an actual population mean. As you know, we can only obtainx, the
mean of a sample randomly selected from the population of interest. We can use X to find a range of
values:

Lower value<population mean <Upper value
That we can be really confident contains the population meany. The range of values is called a
"confidence interval."

PROBLEMS
1. State Central limit theorem. Use the theorem to evaluate P[50 < X < 56] where X represents

the mean of a random sample of size 100 from an infinite population with mean p = 53 and
variance 0” = 400.
Sol.
The central limit theorem states that the sample mean x follows approximately the normal

distribution with mean jand standard deviation FE (is also called Standard error), i.e., x~N (u, <)

, where  , care mean and standard deviation of the population from where the sample.
Given,
Sample size n=100
Mean of the population p = 53
Variance of the population o? = 400 > o = V400 = 20
