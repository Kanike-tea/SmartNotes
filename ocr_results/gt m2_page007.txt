of edge-disjoint circuits. Since the degree of every vertex in a circuit is two, the
degree of every vertex in G is even. Hence G is an Euler graph.

Conversely, let G be an Euler graph. Consider a vertex v,. There are at least
two edges incident at v,. Let one of these edges be between v, and v5. Since
vertex V> is also of even degree, it must have at least another edge, say between
Vy and v3. Proceeding in this fashion, we eventually arrive at a vertex that has
previously been traversed, thus forming a circuit I’. Let us remove [' from G. All
vertices in the remaining graph (not necessarily connected) must also be of even
degree. From the remaining graph remove another circuit in exactly the same
way as we removed [ from G. Continue this process until no edges are left.
Hence the theorem. =

Arbitrarily Traceable Graphs: Consider the graph in Fig. 2-17, which is an
Euler graph. Suppose that we start from vertex a and trace the path a bc.

d e

Fig. 2-17 Arbitrarily traceable graph from c.

Now at c we have the choice of going to a, d, or e. If we took the first choice, we
would only trace the circuit a b c a, which is not an Euler line. Thus, starting
from a, we cannot trace the entire Euler line simply by moving along any edge
that has not already been traversed. This raises the following interesting
question:

What property must a vertex v in an Euler graph have such that an Euler line
is always obtained when one follows any walk from vertex v according to the
single rule that whenever one arrives at a vertex one shall select any edge (which
has not been previously traversed)?

Such a graph is called an arbitrarily traceable graph from vertex v. For
instance, the Euler graph in Fig. 2-17 is an arbitrarily traceable graph from
vertex c, but not from any other vertex. The Euler graph in Fig. 2-18 is not
arbitrarily traceable from any .vertex; the graph in Fig. 2-19 is arbitrarily
traceable from all its vertices. The following interesting theorem, due to Ore [2-
5], answers the question just raised.
