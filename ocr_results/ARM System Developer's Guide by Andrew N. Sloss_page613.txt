600 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

= These instructions are useful to convert big-endian data to little-endian and vice

versa.
Examples
REV r0, r0 -; switch endianness of a word
REV16 = r0, r0 3 Switch endianness of two packed halfwords
REVSH 0, r0  ; switch endianness of a signed halfword
RFE Return from exception
1. RFE<amode> Rn! ARMv6,
This performs the operation that LDM<amode> Rn{!}, {pc, cpsr} would perform if LDM
allowed a register list of {pc, cpsr}. See the entry for LDM.
ROR Rotate right for Thumb (see MOV for the ARM equivalent)
1. ROR Ld, Ls THUMBv1
Action Effect on the cpsr
1. Ld = Ld ROR Ls[7:0] Updated
Notes
= The cpsr is updated: N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>, C = <shifter_C> (see Table A.3).
RSB Reverse subtract of two 32-bit integers

1. RSB<cond>{S} Rd, Rn, #<rotated_immed> ARMV1
2. RSB<cond>{S} Rd, Rn, Rm {, <shift>} ARMV1
Action Effect on the cpsr

1. Rd = <rotated_immed> - Rn Updated if S suffix present

2. Rd = <shifted_Rm> - Rn Updated if S suffix present
Notes

= If the operation updates the cpsr and Rd is not pc, then N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>,
C = <NoUnsignedOverflow>, and V = <SignedOverflow>. The carry flag is set this way
