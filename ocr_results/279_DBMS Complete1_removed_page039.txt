LECTURE-12: FILE ORGANISATION

FILE ORGANISATION AND ITS TYPES:

A file organization is a technique to organize data in the secondary memory. File organization is a
way of arranging the records in a file when the file is stored on the disk. Data files are organized so
as to facilitate access to records and to ensure their efficient storage. A DBMS supports several file
organization techniques.

(File organization techniques)
Heap files (unordered file)

Basically these files are unordered file. It is the simplest and most basic type. These files consist of
randomly ordered records. The records will have no particular order.The operations we can perform
on the records are insert , retrieve and delete. The features of the heap file organization are:
e New records can be inserted in any empty space that can accommodate them.
« When old records are deleted, the occupied space becomes empty and available for any new
insertion.
e Ifupdated records grow, they may need to be relocated to a new empty space. This needs to
keep a list of empty space.

Advantage of heap files:
1. This is a simple file organization method
2. Insertion is somehow efficient
3. Good for bulk-lading data into a table.
4. Best if file scans are common or insertions are frequent
Disadvantages of heap files:

1. Retrieval requires a linear search and is inefficient
