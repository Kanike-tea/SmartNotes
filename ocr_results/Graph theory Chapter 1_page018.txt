1.2. Graphs < un

Let G = (V,E) be a simple graph of order \V| = n and size \E| = m. If G is a
bipartite graph, prove that 4m < nr.
p Let V; and V2 be the bipartites of G, with |V,| = r and |V2| = s. Since |V| = 7, we should
haver+s =n, sothatr=n-—sands=n~r.
The graph G has the maximum number of edges when each of the r vertices in V; is joined
by an edge to each of the s vertices in V2, and this maximum is equal to rs. This means that

|El=msrs.
When 7 is even, we may express rs as

rs=rtn-=m-7 =(2) -(r-2)

Evidently, rs is maximum when r = (n/2), the maximum being (n/2)*. Thus, when n is
n\2
msrsS\|r]}.-
ns (3)
When n is odd, we may express rs as

(n-1)(n+ 1) n-1 n+1

even, we have

rs=r(n-r)=

Evidently, rs is maximum when r = (n — 1)/2 or r = (n + 1)/2, the maximum being

(n—1)(n + 1)/4. Thus, when n is odd, we have

Accordingly, in both of the possible cases (n is even or odd), we have

Show that a simple graph of order n = 4 and size m = 5 cannot be a bipartite
graph.
> Here, 4m = 20 and n? = 16, so that 4m > n. Therefore, the given simple graph cannot be

a bipartite graph. 2
