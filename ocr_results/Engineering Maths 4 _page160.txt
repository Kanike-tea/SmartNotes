>> [It is convenient to do the problem in the polar formas u and v can be found easily]
By data w = logz. Taking z = ré° wehave,
utive log (re!) = logr+ log (¢°) = logr + iO loge

ie, utivelogr+i0 (- loge = 1)

u = logr v = 0 and hence we have,

u= ” y= 0

uy = 0 Yg=1

C-R equations in the polar form: ru, = vg and rv, =—up) are satisfied.
Thus w = logz is analytic.

Also we have in the polar form,

f'(z) = 8 (u, + iv,)

Since z= re'®, fey

C-R equations in the polar form ru, = vy and rv, = - ty are satisfied.
