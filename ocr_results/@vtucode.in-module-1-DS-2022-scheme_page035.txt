Pattern Matching

Assume that we have two strings, string and pat, where pat is a pattern to be searched for in
string. The easiest way to determine if pat is in string is to use the built-in function strstr. If
we have the following declarations:

char pat [MAX-SIZE], string[MAX-SIZE], *t;
then we use the following statements to determine if pat is in string:

if (t = strstr(string, pat) )
printf("The string from strstr is: %s\n",t);
else
printf ("The pattern was not found with strstr\n");
The call (t = strstr(string pat)) returns a null pointer if pat is not in string.
If pat is in string, t holds a pointer to the start of pat in string. The entire string beginning at
position t is printed out.
Although strstr seems ideally suited to pattern matching, there are two reasons why we may
want to develop our own pattern matching function:

e The function strstr is new to ANSI C.Therefore, it may not be available with the
compiler we are using.

e There are several different methods for implementing a pattern matching function.
The easiest but least efficient method sequentially examines each character of the
string until it finds the pattern or it reaches the end of the string. If pat is not in string,
this method has a computing time of O(n . m) where n is the length of pat and w is the
length of string. We can do much better than this, if we create our own pattern

matching function.
