any cell type.

c. Multipotent Stem Cells: These differentiate into a closely related cell type. E.g., the

hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into red blood cells and white blood cells.

d. Oligopotent Stem Cells: Adult lymphoid or myeloid cells are oligopotent. They can

differentiate into a few different types of cells.

e. Unipotent Stem Cells: They can produce cells only of their own type. Since they have the

ability to renew themselves, they are known as unipotent stem cells. E.g., Muscle stem cells.
2. Adult Stem Cells:

These stem cells are obtained from developed organs and tissues. They can repair and replace the
damaged tissues in the region where they are located. For eg., hematopoietic stem cells are found
in the bone marrow. These stem cells are used in bone marrow transplants to treat specific types

of cancers.
3. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells:

These cells have been tested and arranged by converting tissue-specific cells into embryonic cells
in the lab. These cells are accepted as an important tool to learn about the normal development,
onset and progression of the disease and are also helpful in testing various drugs. These stem cells
share the same characteristics as embryonic cells do. They also have the potential to give rise to

all the different types of cells in the human body.
4. Mesenchymal Stem Cells

These cells are mainly formed from the connective tissues surrounding other tissues and organs,
known as the stroma. These mesenchymal stem cells are accurately called stromal cells. The first
mesenchymal stem cells were found in the bone marrow that is capable of developing bones, fat

cells, and cartilage.

There are different mesenchymal stem cells that are used to treat various diseases as they have
been developed from different tissues of the human body. The characteristics of mesenchymal

stem cells depend on the organ from where they originate.

Applications of Stem Cells
Following are the important applications of stem cells:

1. Tissue Regeneration: This is the most important application of stem cells. The stem cells can
