Though the skeletal system has potential as a scaffold for tissue growth, successful
application requires further research, customization, and integration with tissue engineering
strategies specific to the desired tissue type.

3.2.3 Bioengineering Solutions for Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens the bones and makes them more likely to break
(fracture), especially the bones in the hip, spine, and wrist. It occurs when the body loses bone
mass and density more quickly than it can be replaced, leading to fragile bones that are prone to
fracture.

Osteoporosis is a common condition, especially among older women, and it can increase
the risk of falls and fractures, which can result in significant pain and disability. Risk factors for
osteoporosis include being female, older age, having a family history of the condition, smoking,
drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, being thin or having a small body frame, and having a
low calcium intake.

Treatment for osteoporosis aims to slow down bone loss, prevent fractures, and treat
fractures if they occur. Some of the treatments include:

e Medications: Bisphosphonates, denosumab, and teriparatide are some of the medications
that can slow down bone loss and reduce the risk of fractures.

e Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation: Calcium and Vitamin D are essential for healthy
bones, and taking supplements can help maintain bone mass.

e Exercise: Weight-bearing and resistance exercises can help improve bone density and reduce
the risk of fractures.

e Lifestyle changes: Quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and eating a healthy
diet that includes enough calcium and Vitamin D can help maintain healthy bones.
