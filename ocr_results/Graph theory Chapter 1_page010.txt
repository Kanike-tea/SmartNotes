1.2. Graphs 13

The definition of a graph/digraph does not impose any upper limits for the number of
vertices and the number of edges. Thus, a graph/digraph can have infinitely many vertices
and/or infinitely many edges. A graph/digraph with only a finite number of vertices as well
as only a finite number of edges is called a finite graph/digraph; otherwise, it is called an
infinite graph/digraph. In what follows, we will be concerned only with finite graphs/digraphs.
Accordingly, by a graph/digraph we will mean only a finite graph/digraph.

In the following discussions (in this Chapter and in Chapters 2 — 4), our major interest will
be towards graphs. Only when it is needed, a digraph will be brought in. All the definitions and
results that hold for graphs can be extended to digraphs, but with appropriate modifications in
terminology.

Order and Size

[The number of vertices in a (finite) graph is called the order of the graph and the number
of edges in it is called its size. In other words, for a graph G = (V, E), the cardinality of the set
V, namely |V|, is called the order of G and the cardinality of the set E, namely |E], is called the
size of G. A graph of order n and size m is called a (n, m) graph. Thus, the h depicted in
Figure 1.15(a) is a (4.5) graph. A null graph with n vertices is a (n, 0) woh]
End vertices, loop, multiple edges

Generally, the vertices of a graph are denoted by A, B, C, etc., or v1, v2, v3, etc. When it

is convenient, we denote the edges of a graph by 1, é2, ¢3, and so on. If v; and v; denote two
vertices of a graph and if e, denotes an edge joining v; and v;, then v; and v; are called the end
vertices (or end points) of ex. This is symbolically written as e, = {vj, vj} = vivj. For example,
in the graph shown in Figure 1.15(a), suppose we denote the edges AB, BC, AC, AD and DC
by ¢}, €2, €3, eg and es respectively. Then e joins A and B; that is, e, = {A, B} = AB so that A
and B are the end vertices of e,. Similarly, e joins B and C; that is, e2 = {B,C} = BC, so that
Band C are the end vertices of e2, and so on.
Now,{consider the graph shown in Figure 1.16. We note that this graph consists of four
vertices v1, v2, v3, v4, and six edges €1, €2, €3, €4, 5, &6- Although the edges e2 and e3 seem
to intersect (cross over) in the figure,” their point of intersection (even when it exists) is not
a vertex of the graph. We observe that the edges e1, 2, e3 have distinct end vertices, but the
edge e4 has the same vertex v3 as both of its end vertices; that is, eg = {v3,¥3}. An edge such

a8 e4 is called a loop. We also observe that both of the edges es and eg have the same end
_ Vertices vy, v4; that is, es = {v1, v4} and e6 = {v1, v4}. Edges such as these are called parallel
edges. If in a graph there are two or more edges with the same end vertices, the edges are called
multiple eee. |

If the vertices are in different planes, e2 and e; may not intersect.
