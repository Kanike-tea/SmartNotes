Thus we have 95% confidence limits for pt given by xt

Similarly 99% confidence limits for 1 are given by x+ rT ton

Note : Confidence limits are also called Fiducial limits.

e Test of significance of difference between sample means

Consider two independent samples x,(i = 1, 2,-++”,) and yO =1,2,---m))
drawn from a normal population.

Let (x, 6,,) and (y, oy ) respectively be the mean and variance of iin twosamples.

Let pp be ihe sient meanand o be the population variance. We need to test the
hypothesis whether the difference between the sample 1 means is significant.

and degrees of freedom v = n,+n,-2

if || > to; the difference between the sample means is said to be significant at 5%

level of significance. Similarly for 1% level of significance also.

5.17| Chi- Square distribution

Chi - Square distribution provides a measure of correspondence between the
theoretical frequencies and observed frequencies.

If0,(i = 1,2,...") and E,(i = 1,2,...) — en denotes a set of observed
and estimated frequencies, the quantity chi- square denoted by ra is defined as follows.

; degrees of freedom= n-1

Note : If the expected frequencies are less than 10, we group them suitably for computing
the value of chi. square.
