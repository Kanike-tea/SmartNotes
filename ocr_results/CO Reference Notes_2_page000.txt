BASIC STRUCTURE OF COMPUTERS

BASIC CONCEPTS
+ Computer Architecture (CA) is concerned with the structure and behavior of the computer.

* CA includes the information formats, the instruction set and techniques for addressing
memory.

+ In general covers, CA covers 3 aspects of computer-design namely: 1) Computer Hardware,
2) Instruction set Architecture and 3) Computer Organization.

1. Computer Hardware - It consists of electronic circuits, displays, and magnetic and optical
storage media and communication facilities.

2. Instruction Set Architecture - It is programmer visible machine interface such as instruction
set, registers, memory organization and exception handling.

Two main approaches are 1) CISC and 2) RISC.
(CISC- Complex Instruction Set Computer, RISC-Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
3. Computer Organization
It includes the high level aspects of a design, such as
« Memory-system
e Bus-structure &

e Design of the internal CPU.

FUNCTIONAL UNITS

A computer consists of 5 functionally independent main parts:

1) Input 2) Memory 3) ALU 4) Output 5) Control units.
