Let us see what the solution is (as given by Euler). Denote the land areas of the city
by A, B, P, Q, where A, B are the banks of the river and P, Q are the islands (See Fi r
1.125). Construct a graph by treating the four land areas as four vertices and the seven bri

connecting them as seven edges. The graph is as shown in Figure 1.126. |

We note that, in this graph,

deg(A) = deg(B) = deg(Q) =3, deg(P) = 5
