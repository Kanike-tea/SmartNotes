112 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

the superclass entity type. A subclass is defined in order to group the entities to
which these attributes apply. The members of the subclass may still share the
majority of their attributes with the other members of the superclass. For example,
in Figure 4.1 the SECRETARY subclass has the specific attribute Typing_speed,
whereas the ENGINEER subclass has the specific attribute Eng_type, but
SECRETARY and ENGINEER share their other inherited attributes from the
EMPLOYEE entity type.

The second reason for using subclasses is that some relationship types may be par-
ticipated in only by entities that are members of the subclass. For example, if only
HOURLY_EMPLOYEES can belong to a trade union, we can represent that fact by
creating the subclass HOURLY_EMPLOYEE of EMPLOYEE and relating the subclass
to an entity type TRADE_UNION via the BELONGS_TO relationship type, as illus-
trated in Figure 4.1.

4.2.2 Generalization

We can think of a reverse process of abstraction in which we suppress the differences
among several entity types, identify their common features, and generalize them
into a single superclass of which the original entity types are special subclasses. For
example, consider the entity types CAR and TRUCK shown in Figure 4.3(a). Because
they have several common attributes, they can be generalized into the entity type
VEHICLE, as shown in Figure 4.3(b). Both CAR and TRUCK are now subclasses of the
