QUERY PROCESSING

Query processing includes translation of high-level queries into low-level expressions that can be used at the
physical level of the file system, query optimization and actual execution of the query to get the result. It is a
three-step process that consists of parsing and translation, optimization and execution of the query submitted
by the user.

Query-processing Steps

A query is processed in four general steps:
1. Scanning and Parsing
2. Query Optimization or planning the execution strategy
3. Query Code Generator (interpreted or compiled)
4. Execution in the runtime database processor

1. Scanning and Parsing

When a query is first submitted (via an applications program), it must be scanned and parsed to
determine if the query consists of appropriate syntax.

Scanning is the process of converting the query text into a tokenized representation.

The tokenized representation is more compact and is suitable for processing by the parser.

This representation may be in a tree form.

The Parser checks the tokenized representation for correct syntax.

In this stage, checks are made to determine if columns and tables identified in the query exist in the
database and if the query has been formed correctly with the appropriate keywords and structure.
If the query passes the parsing checks, then it is passed on to the Query Optimizer.

2. Query Optimization or Planning the Execution Strategy

For any given query, there may be a number of different ways to execute it.

Each operation in the query (SELECT, JOIN, etc.) can be implemented using one or more different
Access Routines.
