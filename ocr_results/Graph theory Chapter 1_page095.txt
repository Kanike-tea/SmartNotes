we must find a Hamilton cycle C2 which is edge-disjoint with C,. If the same arran

to be there on subsequent days, then for each day we have to find a Hamilton oe
edge-disjoint with the Hamilton cycles found earlier, By Theorem 3 (above), the num is
such cycles is exactly equal to }(n~1) = $(2k+1~1) = k. Therefore, the seating arrang,
of the desired type can last only for k days.

(a) Show that the number of Hamilton cycles in the complete bipartite Fe
Kya (for n 2 2) is $(n- Int,

(b) How many different Hamilton paths are there in Ky»?

> (a) Let X and Y be the bipartites of Knn, with X = (x1, x2,...,x,} and Y = WY... yh
Then each edge of K,,, is of the form {xi,yj),i,7 = 1,2,...,n. Start with the Vertex 5,
Since this vertex is on every Hamilton cycle of Knn, there are n choices for y,, Where
(x1, y;} belongs to the cycle. From y; we have to return to X inn —-1 ways for the second
edge {y;, x;} of the cycle where i = 2,3,...,n. Continuining in this manner we obtain
(n—1)!n! number of cycles. Since directions are not involved, the total number of cycles
is half this number, namely 3(n-1Inl.

(b) Every Hamilton path in K,,, starts in either X or ¥ and terminates in the other. The

number of such paths is (n!) x (n!) = (n!)?. 1
