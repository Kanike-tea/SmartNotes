Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design

when retrieving the records themselves. A clustering index may be set up as
a multiattribute index if range retrieval by that composite key is useful in
report creation (for example, an index on Zip_code, Store_id, and Product_id
may be a clustering index for sales data).

4. Whether to use a hash index over a tree index. In general, RDBMSs use
B*-trees for indexing. However, ISAM and hash indexes are also provided in
some systems. B*-trees support both equality and range queries on the attri-
bute used as the search key. Hash indexes work well with equality condi-
tions, particularly during joins to find a matching record(s), but they do not
support range queries.

5. Whether to use dynamic hashing for the file. For files that are very volatile—
that is, those that grow and shrink continuously—one of the dynamic hashing
schemes discussed in Section 16.9 would be suitable. Currently, such schemes
are not offered by many commercial RDBMSs.

17.8 Summary

In this chapter, we presented file organizations that involve additional access struc-
tures, called indexes, to improve the efficiency of retrieval of records from a data
file. These access structures may be used in conjunction with the primary file orga-
nizations discussed in Chapter 16, which are used to organize the file records them-
selves on disk.

Three types of ordered single-level indexes were introduced: primary, clustering,
and secondary. Each index is specified on a field of the file. Primary and cluster-
ing indexes are constructed on the physical ordering field of a file, whereas sec-
ondary indexes are specified on nonordering fields as additional access structures
to improve performance of queries and transactions. The field for a primary
index must also be a key of the file, whereas it is a nonkey field for a clustering
index. A single-level index is an ordered file and is searched using a binary search.
We showed how multilevel indexes can be constructed to improve the efficiency
of searching an index. An example is IBM’s popular indexed sequential access
method (ISAM), which is a multilevel index based on the cylinder/track configu-
ration on disk.

Next we showed how multilevel indexes can be implemented as B-trees and
B*-trees, which are dynamic structures that allow an index to expand and shrink
dynamically. The nodes (blocks) of these index structures are kept between half full
and completely full by the insertion and deletion algorithms. Nodes eventually sta-
bilize at an average occupancy of 69% full, allowing space for insertions without
requiring reorganization of the index for the majority of insertions. B*-trees can
generally hold more entries in their internal nodes than can B-trees, so they may
have fewer levels or hold more entries than does a corresponding B-tree.

We gave an overview of multiple key access methods, and we showed how an index
can be constructed based on hash data structures. We introduced the concept of
