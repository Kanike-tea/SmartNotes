Chapter 1: Introduction to Databases

1.1 Introduction

Databases and database technology have a major impact on the growing use ofcomputers. It is fair
to say that databases play a critical role in almost all areas wherecomputers are used, including
business, electronic commerce, engineering, medicine, genetics, law, education, and library

science.

Database
A database is a collection of related data.1 Bydata,we mean known facts that can berecorded and
that have implicit meaning. For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of

the people you know.

A database has the following implicit properties:

= Itrepresents some aspect _of the real world, sometimes called the miniworldor the universe

of discourse (UoD). Changes to the miniworld are reflected in the database.

= Itis a logically coherent collection of data, towhich some meaning can be attached.
= It is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose.Jt has an intended _group

of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested.

To summarize: a database has some source (i.e., the miniworld) from which data are derived, some
degree of interaction with events in the represented miniworld and an audience that is interested in

using it.

Size/Complexity:A database can be of any size and complexity. For example, the list of names
andaddresses referred to earlier may consist of only a few hundred records, each with asimple
structure. An example of a large commercial database is Amazon.com. It contains data forover 20
million books, CDs, videos, DVDs, games, electronics, apparel, and other

items.

maintained manually. Huge and complex database may be created and maintained either by a
