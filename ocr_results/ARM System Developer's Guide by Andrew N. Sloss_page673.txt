660 Appendix D Instruction Cycle Timings

Table D.12 Intel XScale (ARMv5TE) instruction cycle timings.

Instruction class Cycles Notes

ALU 1 +1 ifa register-specified shift, or RRX, is used.
+4 if Rdis pe.

B, BL 1 +4 if the branch is mispredicted.

BX, BLX 5 [1 cycle if not executed. ]

LDR/B/H/SB/SH Rdnot pe 1 Rdis not available for two cycles.

LDR Rais pe 8 [2 cycles if not executed. ]

LDRD 1 Rd is not available for two cycles. R(d + 1) is not available for
three cycles.
+1 if Rdis r12.

LDM not loading pe 2+N__ The last value loaded is not available for two cycles. The value
previous to that is not available for one cycle.

LDM loading pe 7+N__ Increase to 10 cycles if N <3.
[3 +N cycles if not executed. ]

MCR to copro 15 2

MRC from copro 15 4

MRS 1 Ris not available for one cycle.

MSR 2 +4 if any of the csx fields are updated.

MUL, MLA 1 Rd is not available for M cycles. You cannot start another
multiply in the next M — | cycles.

MULS, MLAS 1+M

xMULL 1 RdHiis not available for M + 1 cycles. RdLo is not available for
M cycles. You cannot start another multiply in the next M_
cycles.

xMLAL 2 RdHiis not available for M cycles. RdLo is not available for
M — 1 cycles. You cannot start another multiply in the next
M — lcycles.

xMULLS, xMLALS 2+M

PLD 1

QxADD, QxSUB 1 Rd is not available for one cycle.

SMULxy, SMLAxy 1 Rdis not available for one cycle.

SMULWx, SMLAWx 1 Rd is not available for two cycles. You cannot start another
multiply for one cycle.

SMLALxy 2 RdHiis not available for one cycle.

STR/B/H 1

STRD 2
