components. If the composite attribute is referenced only as a whole, there is no
need to subdivide it into component attributes. For example, if there is no need to
refer to the individual components of an address (Zip Code, street, and so on), then
the whole address can be designated as a simple attribute.

Single-Valued versus Multivalued Attributes. Most attributes have a single
value for a particular entity; such attributes are called single-valued. For example,
Age is a single-valued attribute of a person. In some cases an attribute can have a
set of values for the same entity—for instance, a Colors attribute for a car, or a
College_degrees attribute for a person. Cars with one color have a single value,
whereas two-tone cars have two color values. Similarly, one person may not have any
college degrees, another person may have one, and a third person may have two or
more degrees; therefore, different people can have different numbers of values for the
College_degrees attribute. Such attributes are called multivalued. A multivalued
attribute may have lower and upper bounds to constrain the number of values allowed
for each individual entity. For example, the Colors attribute of a car may be restricted to
have between one and two values, if we assume that a car can have two colors at most.

Stored versus Derived Attributes. In some cases, two (or more) attribute val-
ues are related—for example, the Age and Birth_date attributes of a person. For a
particular person entity, the value of Age can be determined from the current
(today’s) date and the value of that person’s Birth_date. The Age attribute is hence
called a derived attribute and is said to be derivable from the Birth_date attribute,
which is called a stored attribute. Some attribute values can be derived from related
entities; for example, an attribute Number_of_employees of a DEPARTMENT entity
can be derived by counting the number of employees related to (working for) that
department.

NULL Values. In some cases, a particular entity may not have an applicable value
for an attribute. For example, the Apartment_number attribute of an address applies
only to addresses that are in apartment buildings and not to other types of resi-
dences, such as single-family homes. Similarly, a College_degrees attribute applies
only to people with college degrees. For such situations, a special value called NULL
is created. An address of a single-family home would have NULL for its
Apartment_number attribute, and a person with no college degree would have
NULL for College_degrees. NULL can also be used if we do not know the value of an
attribute for a particular entity—for example, if we do not know the home phone
number of ‘John Smith’ in Figure 3.3. The meaning of the former type of NULL is
not applicable, whereas the meaning of the latter is unknown. The unknown category
of NULL can be further classified into two cases. The first case arises when it is known
that the attribute value exists but is missing—for instance, if the Height attribute of a
person is listed as NULL. The second case arises when it is not known whether the
attribute value exists—for example, if the Home_phone attribute of a person is NULL.

Complex Attributes. Notice that, in general, composite and multivalued attri-
butes can be nested arbitrarily. We can represent arbitrary nesting by grouping
