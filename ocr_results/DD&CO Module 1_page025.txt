The procedure for converting a multilevel AND—OR diagram to an all-NOR diagram is similar to
the one presented for NAND gates. For the NOR case, we must convert each OR gate to an OR-invert
symbol and each AND gate to an invert-AND symbol. Any bubble that is not compensated by another
bubble along the same line needs an inverter, or the complementation of the input literal. The
transformation of the AND-OR diagram of function F = (AB' + A'B)(C + D') into a NOR diagram is
shown in Fig. The Boolean function for this circuit is F = (AB'+ A'B)(C + D')

Implementing F = (AB' + A'B)(C + D') with NOR gates

Hardware Description Language

A hardware description language (HDL) is a computer-based language that describes the hardware of
digital systems in a textual form. It resembles an ordinary computer programming language, such as C,
but is specifically oriented to describing hardware structures and the behavior of logic circuits. It can be
used to represent logic diagrams, truth tables, Boolean expressions, and complex abstractions of the

behavior of a digital system.

As a documentation language, an HDL is used to represent and document digital systems in a form that

can be read by both humans and computers and is suitable as an exchange language between designers.

Design entry creates an HDL-based description of the functionality that is to be implemented in

hardware.

Logic simulation displays the behavior of a digital system through the use of a computer. A simulator
interprets the HDL description and either produces readable output, such as a time-ordered sequence of

input and output signal values, or displays waveforms of the signals.
