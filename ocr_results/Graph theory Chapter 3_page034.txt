sample 2 A code for {a, b,c, d, e} is given by

a:00, 6:01, ¢: 101, d: x10, e:yzl,

where x,y,z € {0, 1}. Determine x, y and z so\that the given code is a prefix code.
» If we set x = 0, then the code for d reads 010 which contains the code 01 for b as a prefix.
Therefore, we cannot take x = 0. This implies that x = 1. Then, d: 110.

If we set y = 0, z = O then the code for e reads 001, which contains the code for a as a
prefix. If we set y = 0, z = 1, then the code for e reads 011, which contains the code for b as a

prefix. If we set y = 1, z = 0, then the code for e becomes identical with that for c. Hence, we

take y= 1,z= 1 so thate: 111.
With the choices of x, y, Z as obtained-abové'the given code reads

a:00, .6:.01,,..¢3)101,,, d:110,.¢: 111,

This is evidently a prefix code. ,, 6 100 00
