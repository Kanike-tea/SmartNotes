Fig. 9-1 Directed graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges.

In a digraph an edge is not only incident on a vertex, but is also incident out of
a vertex and incident into a vertex. The vertex v;, which edge e, is incident out

of, is called the initial vertex of e,. The vertex Vj» which e, is incident into, is
called the terminal vertex of e,. In Fig. 9-1, vs is the initial vertex and v4 is the
terminal vertex of edge e;. An edge for which the initial and terminal vertices are
the same forms a self-loop, such as e;. (Some authors reserve the term arc for an

oriented or directed edge. We use the term edge to mean either an undirected or
a directed edge. Whenever there is a possibility of confusion, we shall explicitly
state directed or undirected edge.)

The number of edges incident out of a vertex v; is called the out-degree (or

out-valence or outward demidegree) of v; and is written d*(v;). The number of
edges incident into v; is called the in-degree (or invalence or inward demidegree)

of v, and is written as d“(v;). In Fig. 9-1, for example,
d*(v)=3, d-(vy)=1
d*(vy)=1,  d (v9) =2,
d*(v;)=4, d~(v5)=0.
