One of the most complex organ system to ever evolve, the human nervous system consists of two
parts, namely:

1. Central Nervous System (consists of the brain and spinal cord)
2. Peripheral Nervous System (includes all the nerves of the body)

Central Nervous System

Central Nervous System (CNS) is often called the central processing unit of the body. It consists
of the brain and the spinal cord.

Brain

The brain is one of the important, largest and central organ of the human nervous system. It is the
control unit of the nervous system, which helps us in discovering new things, remembering and
understanding, making decisions, and a lot more. It is enclosed within the skull, which provides
frontal, lateral and dorsal protection. The human brain is composed of three major parts:

e  Forebrain:
Thalamus.
e Midbrain: The smaller and central part of the brainstem, consists of Tectum and
Tegmentum.
e Hindbrain: The central region of the brain, composed of Cerebellum, Medulla and Pons.

[he anterior part of the brain, consists of Cerebrum, Hypothalamus and

Spinal Cord

The spinal cord is a cylindrical bundle of nerve fibers and associated tissues enclosed within the
spine and connect all parts of the body to the brain. It begins in continuation with the medulla and
extends downwards. It is enclosed in a bony cage called vertebral column and surrounded by
membranes called meninges. The spinal cord is concerned with spinal reflex actions and the
conduction of nerve impulses to and from the brain.
