This theorem enables us to solve the problem of the seating arrangement at a
round table, introduced in Chapter 1, as follows:

Representing a member x by a vertex and the possibility of his sitting next to
another member y by an edge between x and y, we construct a graph G. Since
every member is allowed to sit next to any other member, G is a complete graph
of nine vertices—nine being the number of people to be seated around the table.
Every Seating arrangement around the table is clearly a Hamiltonian circuit.

The first day of their meeting they can sit in any order, and it will be a
Hamiltonian circuit H,. The second day, if they are to sit such that every
member must have different neighbors, we have to find another Hamiltonian
circuit H, in G, with an entirely different set of edges from those in H,; that is,
Hy, and Hp are edge-disjoint Hamiltonian circuits. From Theorem 2-8 the number
of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian circuits in G is four; therefore, only four such
arrangements exist among nine people.

Another interesting result on the question of existence of Hamiltonian circuits
in a graph, obtained by G. A. Dirac, is:

THEOREM 2-9

A sufficient (but by no means necessary) condition for a simple graph G to
have a Hamiltonian circuit is that the degree of every vertex in G be at least n/2,
where n is the number of vertices in G.
