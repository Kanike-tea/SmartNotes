e The operators are arranged from highest precedence to lowest. Operators with

highest precedence are evaluated first.

e The associativity column indicates how to evaluate operators with the same

precedence. For example, the multiplicative operators have left-to-right

associativity. This means that the expression a * b / c % d/e is equivalent to (

(((a*b)/c) %d)/e)

e Parentheses are used to override precedence, and expressions are always evaluated

from the innermost parenthesized expression first
