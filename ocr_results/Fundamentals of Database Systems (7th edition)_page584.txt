Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures

The main component of an SSD is a controller and a set of interconnected flash
memory cards. Use of NAND flash memory is most common. Using form factors
compatible with 3.5 inch or 2.5 inch HDDs makes SSDs pluggable into slots already
available for mounting HDDs on laptops and servers. For ultrabooks, tablets, and
the like, card-based form factors such as mSATA and M.2 are being standardized.
Interfaces like SATA express have been created to keep up with advancements in
SSDs. Because there are no moving parts, the unit is more rugged, runs silently, is
faster in terms of access time and provides higher transfer rates than HDD. As
opposed to HDDs, where related data from the same relation must be placed on
contiguous blocks, preferably on contiguous cylinders, there is no restriction on
placement of data on an SSD since any address is directly addressable. As a result,
the data is less likely to be fragmented; hence no reorganization is needed. Typi-
cally, when a write to disk occurs on an HDD, the same block is overwritten with
new data. In SDDs, the data is written to different NAND cells to attain wear-leveling,
which prolongs the life of the SSD. The main issue preventing a wide-scale adop-
tion of SSDs today is their prohibitive cost (see Table 16.1), which tends to be about
70 to 80 cents per GB as opposed to about 15 to 20 cents per GB for HDDs.

In addition to flash memory, DRAM-based SSDs are also available. They are cost-
lier than flash memory, but they offer faster access times of around 10 us (microsec-
onds) as opposed to 100 us for flash. Their main drawback is that they need an

internal battery or an adapter to supply power.

As an example of an enterprise level SSD, we can consider CISCO’s UCS (Unified
Computing System®) Invicta series SSDs. They have made it possible to deploy
SSDs at the data center level to unify workloads of all types, including databases and
virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and to enable a cost-effective, energy-efficient,
and space-saving solution. CISCO’s claim is that Invicta SSDs offer a better price-
to-performance ratio to applications in a multitenant, multinetworked architecture
because of the advantages of SSDs stated above. CISCO states that typically four
times as many HDD drives may be needed to match an SSD-based RAID in perfor-
mance.° The SSD configuration can have a capacity from 6 to 144 TB, with up to 1.2
million I/O operations/second, and a bandwidth of up to 7.2 GB/sec with an aver-
age latency of 200 us.” Modern data centers are undergoing rapid transformation
and must provide real-time response using cloud-based architectures. In this envi-

ronment, SSDs are likely to play a major role.

16.2.4 Magnetic Tape Storage Devices

Disks are random access secondary storage devices because an arbitrary disk block
may be accessed at random once we specify its address. Magnetic tapes are sequen-
tial access devices; to access the nth block on tape, first we must scan the preceding
