248 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus

We will adopt the convention that the resulting relation has the same attribute
names as the first relation R. It is always possible to rename the attributes in the

result using the rename operator.

Figure 8.4 illustrates the three operations. The relations STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR
in Figure 8.4(a) are union compatible and their tuples represent the names of stu-
dents and the names of instructors, respectively. The result of the UNION operation
in Figure 8.4(b) shows the names of all students and instructors. Note that duplicate
tuples appear only once in the result. The result of the INTERSECTION operation
(Figure 8.4(c)) includes only those who are both students and instructors.

Notice that both UNION and INTERSECTION are commutative operations; that is,

RUS=SUR and RAS=SOAR

Both UNION and INTERSECTION can be treated as n-ary operations applicable to
any number of relations because both are also associative operations; that is,

RU(SUT)=(RUS)UT and (RAS)AT=ROA(SOT)
