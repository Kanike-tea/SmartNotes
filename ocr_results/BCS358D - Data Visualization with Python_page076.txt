LAB PROGRAM 08 (b)
8 b) Write a Python program for plotting different types of plots using Bokeh.

Aim: Demonstration of different types of plots using Bokeh.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION
This Python program uses the Bokeh library to create a single plot with multiple types of glyphs,
including a line plot, a bar chart, and a scatter plot. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the

program:

1. Import necessary modules: The program imports NumPy for numerical operations and
Bokeh modules for creating interactive plots.

2. Specify the output file: This line tells Bokeh to generate an HTML file named
"multiple_plots.html" where the plot will be saved.

3. Create a new plot object: This line creates a new Bokeh plot object named fig with
specified width, height, and a title.

4. Generate data for the plot: NumPy is used to generate data for the x-axis (x) and compute
the corresponding y-axis values (y).

5. Add a line glyph to the plot: This line adds a line plot to the figure using the line method.
The line_width parameter sets the width of the line, and legend_label provides a label for
the legend.

6. Add a bar chart to the plot: Here, a vertical bar chart is added to the figure using the vbar
method. The width parameter specifies the width of the bars, and bottom sets the starting
point of the bars.

7. Add a scatter plot to the plot: A scatter plot is added to the figure using the circle method.
The size parameter sets the size of the scatter points, and color specifies the point color.

8. Customize the plot appearance: This code customizes the appearance of the plot by
adding axis labels for the x and y axes and setting the legend location to the top-left
corner.

9. Show the plot: The show function displays the Bokeh plot in a web browser. The plot is

also saved in the HTML file specified earlier using output_file.
In this program, we demonstrate three types of plots:

1. Line Plot: We create a simple line plot of the sine function.

2. Bar Plot: We create a bar plot to visualize the counts of various fruits.
