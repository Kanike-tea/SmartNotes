13.3 XML Documents, DTD, and XML Schema

documents that do not conform to any schema; these would be considered as
semistructured data and are schemaless XML documents. When the value of the
standalone attribute in an XML document is yes, as in the first line in Figure 13.3,
the document is standalone and schemaless.

XML attributes are generally used in a manner similar to how they are used in
HTML (see Figure 13.2), namely, to describe properties and characteristics of the
elements (tags) within which they appear. It is also possible to use XML attributes
to hold the values of simple data elements; however, this is generally not recom-
mended. An exception to this rule is in cases that need to reference another ele-
ment in another part of the XML document. To do this, it is common to use
attribute values in one element as the references. This resembles the concept of for-
eign keys in relational databases, and it is a way to get around the strict hierarchical
model that the XML tree model implies. We discuss XML attributes further in Sec-
tion 13.3 when we discuss XML schema and DTD.

13.3 XML Documents, DTD, and XML Schema

13.3.1 Well-Formed and Valid XML Documents and XML DTD

In Figure 13.3, we saw what a simple XML document may look like. An XML docu-
ment is well formed if it follows a few conditions. In particular, it must start with an
XML declaration to indicate the version of XML being used as well as any other
relevant attributes, as shown in the first line in Figure 13.3. It must also follow the
syntactic guidelines of the tree data model. This means that there should be a single
root element, and every element must include a matching pair of start and end tags
within the start and end tags of the parent element. This ensures that the nested ele-
ments specify a well-formed tree structure.

A well-formed XML document is syntactically correct. This allows it to be pro-
cessed by generic processors that traverse the document and create an internal tree
representation. A standard model with an associated set of API (application pro-
gramming interface) functions called DOM (Document Object Model) allows pro-
grams to manipulate the resulting tree representation corresponding to a
well-formed XML document. However, the whole document must be parsed
beforehand when using DOM in order to convert the document to that standard
DOM internal data structure representation. Another API called SAX (Simple API
for XML) allows processing of XML documents on the fly by notifying the process-
ing program through callbacks whenever a start or end tag is encountered. This
makes it easier to process large documents and allows for processing of so-called
streaming XML documents, where the processing program can process the tags as
they are encountered. This is also known as event-based processing. There are also
other specialized processors that work with various programming and scripting
languages for parsing XML documents.

A well-formed XML document can be schemaless; that is, it can have any tag
names for the elements within the document. In this case, there is no predefined
