Binary Tree Extended Binary Tree

The following tree is its extended binary tree. The circles represent internal nodes, and
square represent external nodes.
Every internal node in the extended tree has exactly two children, and every external

node is a leaf. The result is a complete binary tree.

PROPERTIES OF BINARY TREES
Lemma 1: [Maximum number of nodes]:
(1) The maximum number of nodes on level i of a binary tree is ail, i2l.
(2) The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k is 2k 1 k>1,
Proof:
(1) The proof is by induction on i.
Induction Base: The root is the only node on level i = 1. Hence, the maximum number of
nodes on level i=1 is 2-1 =20 = 1,
Induction Hypothesis: Let i be an arbitrary positive integer greater than 1. Assume that the
maximum number Of nodes on level i -1is 2-2
Induction Step: The maximum number of nodes on level i -1 is 2i-2 by the induction
hypothesis. Since each node in a binary tree has a maximum degree of 2, the maximum

number of nodes on level i is two times the maximum number of nodes on level i-1, or

2k
(2) The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k is k

KY (maximum number of nodes on level i) =¥ 2i-! = 2k-1 j=0 i=0
