e Anesthesia Monitoring: EEG can be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia during
surgery to ensure that the patient remains in a safe and comfortable state.

e Monitoring Brain Activity during Coma: EEG is also used to monitor brain activity
in patients who are in a coma to determine the level of brain function and assess the
likelihood of recovery.

EEG Signals and Types of Brain Activity

EEG signals have unique features that correspond to different types of brain activity. Here

are some of the main types of brain activity that can be detected with EEG:

Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz): Delta waves are low-frequency waves associated with dee sleep,
infancy, and brain disorders such as brain damage or dementia.

Theta waves (4-8 Hz): Theta waves are also associated with sleep and relaxation, as well
as meditation and hypnosis. They are also present during memory encoding and retrieval
processes.

Alpha waves (8-12 Hz): Alpha waves are present when the brain is relaxed and not focused
on any particular task. They are also associated with meditation and creativity.

Beta waves (12-30 Hz): Beta waves are present when the brain is focused on a task, such
as problem-solving or decision-making. They are also associated with anxiety and stress.
Gamma waves (30-100 Hz): Gamma waves are associated with high-level cognitive
processing, such as attention, perception, and memory. They are also involved in sensory
processing and motor control.

The analysis of EEG signals can provide valuable information about brain function and activity,
as well as offer insights into the workings of the human mind.

Robotic arms for prosthetics are advanced prosthetic devices that use robotics technology

to restore functionality to individuals with upper limb amputations. These devices typically use
motors, actuators, and sensors to mimic the movements of a human arm and hand, allowing the
