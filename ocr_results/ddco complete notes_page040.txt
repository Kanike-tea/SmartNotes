DECODERS

A Decoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information from n input
lines to a maximum of 2” unique output lines.

* The decoders presented here are called n -to- m -line decoders, where m ... 2” . Their
purpose is to generate the 2” (or fewer) minterms of n input variables.

* Each combination of inputs will assert a unique output. The name decoder is also
used in conjunction with other code converters, such as a BCD-to-seven-segment
decoder.

2:4 decoder ( 1 of 4 decoder)

A 2 to 4 decoder is a combinational logic circuit that takes two input lines, typically labeled
A and B, and generates four output lines, usually labeled QO, Q1, Q2, and Q3. The decoder
analyzes the input combination and activates the corresponding output line
