Database Management System [BCS403]

the UNION of tuples in two relations R(X, Y) and S(X, Z) that are partially compatible,
meaning that only some of their attributes, say X, are union compatible.
The attributes that are union compatible are represented only once in the result, and those
attributes that are not union compatible from either relation are also kept in the result relation
T(X, Y, Z). Two tuples f; in R and f in S are said to match if t[X]= m[X]. These will be
combined (unioned) into a single tuple in ¢. Tuples in either relation that have no matching tuple
in the other relation are padded with NULL values.
For example, an OUTER UNION can be applied to two relations whose schemas are:
STUDENT(Name, Ssn, Department, Advisor)
INSTRUCTOR(Name, Ssn, Department, Rank)
Tuples from the two relations are matched based on having the same combination of values of
the shared attributes—Name, Ssn, Department. All the tuples from both relations are included in
the result, but tuples with the same (Name, Ssn, Department) combination will appear only once
in the result. Tuples appearing only in STUDENT will have a NULL for the Rank attribute,
whereas tuples appearing only in INSTRUCTOR will have a NULL for the Advisor attribute.
A tuple that exists in both relations, which represent a student who is also an instructor, will
have values for all its attributes The resulting relation, STUDENT_OR_INSTRUCTOR, will
have the following attributes:
STUDENT_OR_INSTRUCTOR(Name, Ssn, Department, Advisor, Rank)

2.6 Examples of Queries in Relational Algebra

Query 1. Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the ‘Research’ department.

RESEARCH _DEPT < 6p )3,,.—ineseanse( DEPARTMENT)
RESEARCH _EMPS © (RESEARCH DEPT P4 9. i.c- ppd
RESULT © firpame, Lname, Adchese(RESEARCH_EMPS)

Asa singlein-line expression, this query becomes:
TFname, Lname, Address (ODname='Rescarch' (DEPARTMENT 4 prumber-Dno(EMPLOYEE))

EMPLOYEE)

Query 2. For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the controlling department

number, and the department manager’s last name, address, and birth date.

STAFFORD_PROIS & optocation~'stafford’( PROJECT)

CONTR_DEPTS — (STAFFORD_PROJS D4 5. paumbe/EPARTMENT)
PROJ_DEPT_MGRS < (CONTR_DEPTS 4 iy san-Sen=MPLOYEE)
RESULT © mpnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate(PROJ_DEPT_MGRS)
