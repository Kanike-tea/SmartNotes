depending on the value of the D input immediately before the clock transition. Synchronized by a clock
signal, the JK flip-flop has two inputs and performs all three operations. The circuit diagram of a JK
flip-flop constructed with a D flip-flop and gates is shown in Fig(a) below. The J input sets the flip-flop
to 1, the K input resets it to 0, and when both inputs are enabled, the output is complemented. This can
be verified by investigating the circuit applied to the D input:

D=JQ'+K'Q

When J = 1 and K = 0, D=Q'+ Q = 1, so the next clock edge sets the output to 1. When J = 0 and K =
1, D =0, so the next clock edge resets the output to 0. When both J = K = 1 and D = Q’, the next clock
edge complements the output. When both J = K = 0 and D = Q, the clock edge leaves the output
unchanged. The graphic symbol for the JK flip-flop is shown in Fig(b).

The T (toggle) flip-flop is a complementing flip-flop and can be obtained from a JK flip-flop when inputs
J and K are tied together. This is shown below in Fig(a). When T = 0 (J = K = 0), a clock edge does not
change the output. When T = | (J = K = 1), a clock edge complements the output. The complementing
flip-flop is useful for designing binary counters.

T flip-flop

The T flip-flop can be constructed with a D flip-flop and an exclusive-OR gate as shown in above Fig(b).
The expression for the D input is

D=T Q=TQ+TQ

When T = 0, D = Q and there is no change in the output. When T = 1, D = Q' and the output complements.
The graphic symbol for this flip-flop has a T symbol in the input.
