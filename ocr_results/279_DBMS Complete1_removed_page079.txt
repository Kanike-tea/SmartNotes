phase 2 into a data model of the choice dbms.

5. Physical databse design
During this phase we design the specification for the database in terms of physical storage
structure ,record placement and indexes.

6. Database system implementation and tuning
During this phase, the database and application programs are implemented, tested and
eventually deployed for service.

Informal Guidelines for Relation Design

Want to keep the semantics of the relation attributes clear. The information in a tuple should
represent exactly one fact or an entity. The hidden or buried entities are what we want to discover
and eliminate.

e Design a relation schema so that it is easy to explain its meaning.

¢ Do not combine attributes from multiple entity types and relationship types into a single
relation. Use a view if you want to present a simpler layout to the end user.

e Arelation schema should correspond to on entity type or relationship type.

¢ Minimize redundant information in tuples, thus reducing update anomalies

¢ Ifanomalies are present, try to decompose the relation into two or more to represent the
separate facts, or document the anomalies well for management in the applications
programs.

Minimize the use of null values. Nulls have multiple interpretations:
¢ The attribute does not apply to this tuple
e = The attribute value is unknown
e The attribute value is absent

e The attribute value might represent an actual value

Tf nulls are likely (non-applicable) then consider decomposition of the relation into two or more
relations that hold only the non-null valued tuples.

¢ Do not permit the creation of spurious tuples

Too much decomposition of relations into smaller ones may also lose information or generate
erroneous information

¢ Be sure that relations can be logically joined using natural join and the result doesn't
generate relationships that don't exist

Functional Dependencies

FD's are constraints on well-formed relations and represent a formalism on the infrastructure of
relation.

Definition: A functional dependency (FD) on a relation schema R is a constraint X — Y, where X
and Yare subsets of attributes of R.
