Why is the Wait-for-memory-function-completed step needed for reading from or
writing to the main memory?

Solution:

The WMEC step is needed to synchronize the operation of the processor and the main
memory.

Problem 2:
For the single bus organization, write the complete control sequence for the

Solution:
PCout, MARin, Read, Select4, Add, Zin

2) Zout, PCin, Yin, WMFC

3) MDRout, IRin

4) R1out, MARin, Read

5) MDRinE, WMFC

XQ

Write the sequence of control steps required for the single bus organization in each of
the following instructions:
a) Add the immediate number NUM to register R1.

b) Add the contents of memory-location NUM to register R1.
c) Add the contents of the memory-location whose address is at memory-location
NUM to register R1.
Assume that each instruction consists of two words. The first word specifies the
operation andN the addressing mode, and the second word contains the number
NUM
