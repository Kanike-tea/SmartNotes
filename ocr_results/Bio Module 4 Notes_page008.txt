e Acoustic noise: The use of sonar technology can also generate acoustic noise, which can
disturb marine life and harm marine ecosystems. This is particularly a concern for high-
power, military-grade sonar systems, which have the potential to cause serious harm to
marine life.

e Complex technology: Sonar technology can be complex, requiring specialized skills and
equipment to operate and maintain. This can limit its accessibility and increase the cost of
implementation.

e Inaccurate readings: Sonar readings can be inaccurate due to factors such as reflection,
refraction, and absorption of sound waves, which can result in incorrect measurements
and false readings.

4.2 Photosynthesis:

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light
energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This process is critical for
life on Earth, as it provides the primary source of energy for all living organisms.
