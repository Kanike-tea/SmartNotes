e¢ DIRQ(Display Interrupt Request) — The output device request the
processor to obtain its service for output operation, by activating this flag
tol.
Control registers
KEN (keyboard Enable) — Enables the keyboard for input operations.

DEN (Display Enable) — Enables the output device for input operations.

Program Controlled I/O

> In this technique CPU is responsible for executing data from the memory for
output and storing data in memory for executing of Programmed I/O

> Drawback of the Programmed I/O: was that the CPU has to monitor the units
all the times when the program is executing. Thus, the CPU stays ina
program loop until the I/O unit indicates that it is ready for data transfer.

> This is a time-consuming process and the CPU time is wasted a lot in keeping
an eye to the executing of program.

e Itis the process of controlling the input and output operations by executing 2
sets of instruction, one set for input operation and the next set for output
operation.

e The program checks the status of I/O register and reads or displays data.
Here the I/O operationis controlled by program.

WAITK TestBit #40, STATUS (Checks SIN
flag) Branch = 0 WAITK
Move DATAIN, RO (Read character) [

*Code to read a character from DATAIN to RO]

This code checks the SIN flag, and if it is set to O (ie. If no character in DATAIN
Buffer), then move back to WAITK label. This loop continues until SIN flag is set
to 1. When SIN is 1, data ismoved from DATAIN to RO register. Thus the program,
continuously checks for input operation.

Similarly code for Output operation,

WAITD TestBit #0, STATUS (Checks SOUT flag)

Branch = 0 WAITD

Move RO, DATAOUT (Send character for

display)

The code checks the SOUT flag, and if it is set to 1 (ie. If no character in
DATAOUT Buffer), then move back to WAITK label. This loop continues until
SOUT flag is set to 0. When SOUT isO, data is moved from RO register to
DATAOUT (ie. Sent by processor).
