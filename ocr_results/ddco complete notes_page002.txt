BASIC THEOREMS AND PROPERTIES OF BOOLEAN ALGEBRA:
Duality:

> The important property of Boolean algebra is called the duality principle
and states that every algebraic expression deducible from the postulates of
Boolean algebra remains valid if the operators and identity elements are
interchanged.

> Ina two-valued Boolean algebra, the identity elements and the elements of
the set Bare the same: 1 and O. The duality principle has many applications.

> If the dual of an algebraic expression is desired, we simply interchange OR
and AND operators and replace 1’s by 0’s and 0’s by 1’s.

Basic Theorems

> Table 1 lists out six theorems of Boolean algebra and four of its postulates. The
theorems and postulates listed are the most basic relationships in Boolean
algebra.

> The theorems, like the postulates, are listed in pairs; each relation is the dual of
the one paired with it. The postulates are basic axioms of the algebraic structure
and need no proof.

> The theorems must be proven from the postulates.
