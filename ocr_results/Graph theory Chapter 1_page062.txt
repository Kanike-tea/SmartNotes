1.6 Walks and their classification

In this Section, we consider five important sub
a path and a cycle. These subgraphs play a
graphs to be introduced in the next Section.

graphs of a graph, called a walk, a trail, a circuit,
major role in studies concerned with connected

Walk

Let G be a graph having at least one edge. In G, consider a finite, alternating sequence of
vertices and edges of the form

Vi €j Vit1 @j+1 Vis2,---,€k Vm

which begins and ends with vertices and which is such that each edge in the sequence is incident
on the vertices preceding and following it in the sequence. Such a sequence is called a walk in
G. In a walk, a vertex or an edge (or both) can appear more than once.

The number of edges present in a walk is called its length.

For example, consider the graph shown below:
