The devices use motors and sensors to mimic the movements of the wearer and help
improve mobility.

e Tissue engineering: This involves using a combination of materials, such as scaffolds and
growth factors, to promote the growth and repair of muscle tissue. The goal is to create
functional muscle tissue that can replace the damaged tissue in individuals with muscular
dystrophy.

These approaches are still in the early stages of development, but hold promise for the

future treatment of muscular dystrophy. Clinical trials and further research are needed to
determine the safety and efficacy of these therapies.

Artificial Muscles

Artificial muscle refers to a type of technology that aims to mimic the properties and
functions of natural muscle. Artificial muscles can be made from various materials, including
shape memory alloys, electroactive polymers, and carbon nanotubes.

Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are materials with the ability to remember and recover
their original shape after being deformed. SMAs, like nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys, are
commonly used in artificial muscle applications. When exposed to heat or an electric current,
SMAs undergo a phase transformation, enabling them to contract and generate force. This
property makes them suitable for mimicking muscle-like movements in devices such as
prosthetics, robotics, and actuators. The unique combination of shape memory and
superelasticity in SMAs provides excellent mechanical properties and durability for artificial
muscle applications.

Electroactive Polymers (EAPs) are a class of materials that exhibit significant changes in
shape or size when subjected to an electric field. These polymers, such as polypyrrole and
polyacrylonitrile, have the ability to undergo large deformation and respond quickly to electrical
stimulation. EAPs are particularly advantageous for artificial muscle applications due to their
lightweight nature, flexibility, and biocompatibility. They can be designed to contract or expand
in response to electrical signals, enabling precise control and mimicry of muscle-like
movements. EAPs have promising potential in areas such as soft robotics, haptic devices, and
biomedical applications.

Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical structures composed of carbon atoms,
exhibiting exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. CNTs possess high tensile
strength and are highly conductive, making them suitable for artificial muscle development. By
utilizing the electromechanical properties of CNTs, they can act as actuators that contract or
expand when stimulated by an electric current. CNT-based artificial muscles offer advantages
such as high power-to-weight ratio, fast response times, and potential scalability. Research is
underway to optimize CNT-based artificial muscles for applications in robotics, aerospace, and
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

Artificial muscles have a number of potential applications, including:

e Robotics: Artificial muscles can be used to create more advanced and flexible robots that
can move and perform tasks more like humans.
