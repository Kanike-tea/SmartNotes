« Mirtual record — contains no data value, only a logical pointer to a particular physical
record.

« When a record is to be replicated in several database trees, a single copy of that record is
kept in one of the trees and all other records are replaced with a virtual record.

« Let R be a record type that is replicated in T1, T2,. . ., Tn. Create a new virtual record type
virtual-R and replace R in each of the n — | trees with a record of type virtual-R.

« Eliminate data replication in the following diagram ; create virtual-customer and virtual-
account.

« Replace account with virtual-account in the first tree, and replace customer with virtual-
customer in the second tree.

e Add a dashed line from virtual-customer to customer, and from virtual-account to account,
to specify the association between a virtual record and its corresponding physical record.

Network Model:
= Data are represented by collections of records.
© similar to an entity in the E-R model
o Records and their fields are represented as record type

= type customer = record type account = record type
YP YP YP
customer-name: string; account-number: integer;
customer-street: string; balance: integer;
customer-city: string;
= end end

= Relationships among data are represented by links
© similar to a restricted (binary) form of an E-R relationship
©. restrictions on links depend on whether the relationship is many-to-many, many-to-
one, or one-to-one.

Data-Structure Diagrams:
= Schema representing the design of a network database.
= A data-structure diagram consists of two basic components:
o Boxes, which correspond to record types.
o Lines, which correspond to links.
= Specifies the overall logical structure of the database.

For every E-R diagram, there is a corresponding data-structure diagram.
