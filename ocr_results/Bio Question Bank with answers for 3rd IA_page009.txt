Types of Bioremediation:
Phytoremediation:

In this method, plants are used to remove heavy metals from the soil or water. The metal-
accumulating ability of certain plant species, called hyperaccumulators, allows them to take up
metals from the environment and store them in their tissues. After the plants have absorbed the
metals, they can be harvested and disposed of properly, effectively removing the metals from
the site.

Chemical extraction:

Chemical agents can be applied to the contaminated area to facilitate the release of heavy
metals from the microbial biomass or the surrounding matrix. Chelating agents, such as
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or citric acid, can be used to form complexes with the
metals, increasing their solubility and facilitating their removal.

Biosor ption:

In this method, the metal-loaded microbial biomass or biofilms can be harvested and separated
from the site. The biomass can then be processed to recover the metals through techniques such
as acid leaching or thermal treatment. The metals can be further purified or recycled for various
industrial applications.

Physical removal:

In some cases, physical methods such as sedimentation, filtration, or membrane separation can
be employed to separate the metal-loaded microbial biomass or biofilms from the surrounding
environment. These techniques rely on the physical properties of the biomass or biofilms, such
as size, density, or adsorption capacity, to separate them from the water or soil.

Electrochemical methods:

Electrochemical techniques, such as electrokinetic remediation or electrocoagulation, can be
utilized to remove heavy metals from the contaminated site. These methods involve the
application of an electric field or the generation of metal precipitates through electrochemical
reactions, resulting in the migration or precipitation of metal ions, which can then be collected
and removed.

8. Explain the invention of Velcro which is inspired from plant burrs and its applications.

Ans. Plant burrs, such as those found on burdock, inspired the invention of Velcro, a

popularhook-and-loop fastening system.
