Chapter 6 Basic SQL

elements can be defined later. For example, the following statement creates a
schema called COMPANY owned by the user with authorization identifier ‘Jsmith’.
Note that each statement in SQL ends with a semicolon.

CREATE SCHEMA COMPANY AUTHORIZATION ‘Jsmith’;

In general, not all users are authorized to create schemas and schema elements. The
privilege to create schemas, tables, and other constructs must be explicitly granted
to the relevant user accounts by the system administrator or DBA.

In addition to the concept of a schema, SQL uses the concept of a catalog—a named
collection of schemas.” Database installations typically have a default environment
and schema, so when a user connects and logs in to that database installation, the
user can refer directly to tables and other constructs within that schema without
having to specify a particular schema name. A catalog always contains a special
schema called INFORMATION_SCHEMA, which provides information on all the
schemas in the catalog and all the element descriptors in these schemas. Integrity
constraints such as referential integrity can be defined between relations only if
they exist in schemas within the same catalog. Schemas within the same catalog can
also share certain elements, such as type and domain definitions.

6.1.2 The CREATE TABLE Command in SQL

The CREATE TABLE command is used to specify a new relation by giving it a name
and specifying its attributes and initial constraints. The attributes are specified first,
and each attribute is given a name, a data type to specify its domain of values, and
possibly attribute constraints, such as NOT NULL. The key, entity integrity, and ref-
erential integrity constraints can be specified within the CREATE TABLE statement
after the attributes are declared, or they can be added later using the ALTER TABLE
command (see Chapter 7). Figure 6.1 shows sample data definition statements in
SQL for the COMPANY relational database schema shown in Figure 3.7.

Typically, the SQL schema in which the relations are declared is implicitly specified
in the environment in which the CREATE TABLE statements are executed. Alterna-
tively, we can explicitly attach the schema name to the relation name, separated by
a period. For example, by writing

CREATE TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE
rather than
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE

as in Figure 6.1, we can explicitly (rather than implicitly) make the EMPLOYEE table
part of the COMPANY schema.

The relations declared through CREATE TABLE statements are called base tables
(or base relations); this means that the table and its rows are actually created

SQL also includes the concept of a cluster of catalogs.
