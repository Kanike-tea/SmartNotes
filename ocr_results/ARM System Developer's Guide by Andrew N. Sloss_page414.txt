113 Summary 401

Memory model—The SLOS kernel is placed in lower memory, and each application has
its own storage area and stack. The microcontroller system registers are placed away
from the ROM and SRAM.

Interrupts and exceptions—SLOS makes use of only three events. These events are Reset,
SWI, and IRQ. All the other unused interrupts and exceptions have a dummy handler
installed.

Scheduler—SLOS implements a simple round-robin scheduler.

Context switch—First the current context is saved into a PCB, and then the next task
context is loaded from a PCB.

Device driver framework—This protects the operating system from applications
accessing hardware directly.
