10.1 Overview of Database Programming Techniques and Issues

Most database systems have an interactive interface where these SQL commands
can be typed directly into a monitor for execution by the database system.
For example, in a computer system where the Oracle RDBMS is installed, the com-
mand SQLPLUS starts the interactive interface. The user can type SQL commands
or queries directly over several lines, ended by a semicolon and the Enter key (that
is, ";<cr>"). Alternatively, a file of commands can be created and executed
through the interactive interface by typing ¢<filename>. The system will execute
the commands written in the file and display the results, if any.

The interactive interface is quite convenient for schema and constraint creation or
for occasional ad hoc queries. However, in practice, the majority of database inter-
actions are executed through programs that have been carefully designed and
tested. These programs are generally known as application programs or database
applications, and are used as canned transactions by the end users, as discussed in
Section 1.4.3. Another common use of database programming is to access a data-
base through an application program that implements a Web interface, for exam-
ple, when making airline reservations or online purchases. In fact, the vast majority
of Web electronic commerce applications include some database access commands.
Chapter 11 gives an overview of Web database programming using PHP, a script-
ing language that has recently become widely used.

In this section, first we give an overview of the main approaches to database pro-
gramming. Then we discuss some of the problems that occur when trying to access
a database from a general-purpose programming language, and the typical sequence
of commands for interacting with a database from a software program.

10.1.1 Approaches to Database Programming

Several techniques exist for including database interactions in application pro-
grams. The main approaches for database programming are the following:

1. Embedding database commands in a general-purpose programming
language. In this approach, database statements are embedded into the host
programming language, but they are identified by a special prefix. For
example, the prefix for embedded SQL is the string EXEC SQL, which pre-
cedes all SQL commands in a host language program.’ A precompiler or
preproccessor scans the source program code to identify database state-
ments and extract them for processing by the DBMS. They are replaced in
the program by function calls to the DBMS-generated code. This technique
is generally referred to as embedded SQL.

2. Using a library of database functions or classes. A library of functions is
made available to the host programming language for database calls. For
example, there could be functions to connect to a database, prepare a query,
execute a query, execute an update, loop over the query result on record at a
time, and so on. The actual database query and update commands and any
