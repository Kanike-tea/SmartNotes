Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases

Area is a method that is applied to calculate the area. Reference_point specifies the
coordinates of a point that determines the object location. Now suppose that we
want to define a number of subtypes for the GEOMETRY_OBJECT type, as follows:

RECTANGLE subtype-of GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Width, Height
TRIANGLE S subtype-of GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Side1, Side2, Angle
CIRCLE subtype-of GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Radius

Notice that the Area operation may be implemented by a different method for each
subtype, since the procedure for area calculation is different for rectangles, trian-
gles, and circles. Similarly, the attribute Reference_point may have a different mean-
ing for each subtype; it might be the center point for RECTANGLE and CIRCLE
objects, and the vertex point between the two given sides for a TRIANGLE object.

Notice that type definitions describe objects but do not generate objects on their
own. When an object is created, typically it belongs to one or more of these types
that have been declared. For example, a circle object is of type CIRCLE and
GEOMETRY_OBJECT (by inheritance). Each object also becomes a member of one
or more persistent collections of objects (or extents), which are used to group
together collections of objects that are persistently stored in the database.

Constraints on Extents Corresponding to a Type Hierarchy. In most ODBs,
an extent is defined to store the collection of persistent objects for each type or sub-
type. In this case, the constraint is that every object in an extent that corresponds to
a subtype must also be a member of the extent that corresponds to its supertype.
Some OO database systems have a predefined system type (called the ROOT class or
the OBJECT class) whose extent contains all the objects in the system.'*

Classification then proceeds by assigning objects into additional subtypes that are
meaningful to the application, creating a type hierarchy (or class hierarchy) for the
system. All extents for system- and user-defined classes are subsets of the extent
corresponding to the class OBJECT, directly or indirectly. In the ODMG model (see
Section 12.3), the user may or may not specify an extent for each class (type),
depending on the application.

An extent is a named persistent object whose value is a persistent collection that
holds a collection of objects of the same type that are stored permanently in the
database. The objects can be accessed and shared by multiple programs. It is also
possible to create a transient collection, which exists temporarily during the execu-
tion of a program but is not kept when the program terminates. For example, a
transient collection may be created in a program to hold the result of a query that
selects some objects from a persistent collection and copies those objects into the
transient collection. The program can then manipulate the objects in the transient
collection, and once the program terminates, the transient collection ceases to exist.
In general, numerous collections—transient or persistent—may contain objects of
the same type.

'This is called OBJECT in the ODMG model (see Section 12.3).
