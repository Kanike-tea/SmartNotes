Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts

present an excellent survey of techniques for analysis of schemas. Pitoura et al.
(1995) discuss object orientation in multidatabase systems. Xiao et al. (2003) pro-
pose an XML-based model for a common data model for multidatabase systems
and present a new approach for schema mapping based on this model. Lakshmanan
et al. (2001) propose extending SQL for interoperability and describe the architec-
ture and algorithms for achieving the same.

Transaction processing in multidatabases is discussed in Mehrotra et al. (1992),
Georgakopoulos et al. (1991), Elmagarmid et al. (1990), and Brietbart et al.
(1990), among others. Elmagarmid (1992) discusses transaction processing for
advanced applications, including engineering applications that are discussed in
Heiler et al. (1992).

The workflow systems, which are becoming popular for managing information in
complex organizations, use multilevel and nested transactions in conjunction with
distributed databases. Weikum (1991) discusses multilevel transaction manage-
ment. Alonso et al. (1997) discuss limitations of current workflow systems. Lopes et
al. (2009) propose that users define and execute their own workflows using a client-
side Web browser. They attempt to leverage Web 2.0 trends to simplify the user’s
work for workflow management. Jung and Yeom (2008) exploit data workflow to
develop an improved transaction management system that provides simultaneous,
transparent access to the heterogeneous storages that constitute the HVEM
DataGrid. Deelman and Chervanak (2008) list the challenges in data-intensive sci-
entific workflows. Specifically, they look at automated management of data, effi-
cient mapping techniques, and user feedback issues in workflow mapping. They
also argue for data reuse as an efficient means to manage data and present the chal-
lenges therein.

A number of experimental distributed DBMSs have been implemented. These
include distributed INGRES by Epstein et al. (1978), DDTS by Devor and Weel-
dreyer (1980), SDD-1 by Rothnie et al. (1980), System R* by Lindsay et al. (1984),
SIRIUS-DELTA by Ferrier and Stangret (1982), and MULTIBASE by Smith et al.
(1981). The OMNIBASE system by Rusinkiewicz et al. (1988) and the Federated
Information Base developed using the Candide data model by Navathe et al. (1994)
are examples of federated DDBMSs. Pitoura et al. (1995) present a comparative
survey of the federated database system prototypes. Most commercial DBMS ven-
dors have products using the client/server approach and offer distributed versions
of their systems. Some system issues concerning client/server DBMS architectures
are discussed in Carey et al. (1991), DeWitt et al. (1990), and Wang and Rowe
(1991). Khoshafian et al. (1992) discuss design issues for relational DBMSs in the
client/server environment. Client/server management issues are discussed in many
books, such as Zantinge and Adriaans (1996). Di Stefano (2005) discusses data dis-
tribution issues specific to grid computing. A major part of this discussion may also
apply to cloud computing.
