Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop

generated by sensors embedded in devices such as smartphones, energy smart
meters, automobiles, and all kinds of gadgets and machinery that sense, create, and
communicate data in the internet of things. And, of course, we must consider the
data generated daily from satellite imagery and communication networks.

This phenomenal growth of data generation means that the amount of data in a single
repository can be numbered in petabytes (10*+15 bytes, which approximates to 2**50
bytes) or terabytes (e.g., 1,000 terabytes). The term big data has entered our common
parlance and refers to such massive amounts of data. The McKinsey report” defines
the term big data as datasets whose size exceeds the typical reach of a DBMS to capture,
store, manage, and analyze that data. The meaning and implications of this data
onslaught are reflected in some of the facts mentioned in the McKinsey report:

= A $600 disk can store all of the world’s music today.
= Every month, 30 billion of items of content are stored on Facebook.

= More data is stored in 15 of the 17 sectors of the U.S. economy than is stored
in the Library of Congress, which, as of 2011, stored 235 terabytes of data.

= There is currently a need for over 140,000 deep-data-analysis positions and
over 1.5 million data-savvy managers in the United States. Deep data analy-
sis involves more knowledge discovery type analyses.

Big data is everywhere, so every sector of the economy stands to benefit by harness-
ing it appropriately with technologies that will help data users and managers make
better decisions based on historical evidence. According to the Mckinsey report,

If the U.S. healthcare [system] could use the big data creatively and effectively to
drive efficiency and quality, we estimate that the potential value from data in the
sector could be more than $300 billion in value every year.

Big data has created countless opportunities to give consumers information in a
timely manner—information that will prove useful in making decisions, discover-
ing needs and improving performance, customizing products and services, giving
decision makers more effective algorithmic tools, and creating value by innovations
in terms of new products, services, and business models. IBM has corroborated this
statement in a recent book,’ which outlines why IBM has embarked on a worldwide
mission of enterprise-wide big data analytics. The IBM book describes various types
of analytics applications:

= Descriptive and predictive analytics: Descriptive analytics relates to report-
ing what has happened, analyzing the data that contributed to it to figure
out why it happened, and monitoring new data to find out what is happen-
ing now. Predictive analytics uses statistical and data mining techniques (see
Chapter 28) to make predictions about what will happen in the future.

The introduction is largely based on the McKinsey (2012) report on big data from the McKinsey Global
Institute.
