The three Boolean functions for C1, C2, and C3 are implemented in the carry lookahead generator shown
in Fig below.

Logic diagram of carry lookahead generator

The construction of a four-bit adder with a carry lookahead scheme is shown in Fig below. Each sum
output requires two exclusive-OR gates. The output of the first exclusive-OR gate generates the Pi
variable, and the AND gate generates the Gi variable. The carries are propagated through the carry
lookahead generator. Thus, outputs S1 through S3 have equal propagation delay times
