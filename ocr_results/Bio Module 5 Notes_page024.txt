place. The chosen technique, is used to build the scaffold layer by layer. The 3D printer precisely
deposits or fuses the chosen material, following the digital model's specifications.

J
Post-processing:

After the 3D printing is complete, post-processing steps may be required. This can include
removing support structures, cleaning the scaffold, and performing any necessary surface
treatments to enhance biocompatibility and optimize the scaffold's properties.

J
Sterilization:
To ensure the implant is free from contaminants and ready for clinical use, the 3D printed bone

scaffold undergoes sterilization using appropriate methods. Common techniques include
autoclaving, ethylene oxide sterilization, or gamma irradiation.

J
Surgical Implantation:

The final step involves the surgical implantation of the 3D printed bone scaffold into the patient.
Surgeons carefully position the scaffold in the intended area, ensuring proper alignment and
stability. Over time, the scaffold provides support for bone regeneration and integrates with the
surrounding tissue.

Scaffold-Based Techniques in 3D Printing of Bone

Scaffold-based techniques in 3D printing of bone refer to the use of three-dimensional
scaffolds as a framework or template for the regeneration of bone tissue. These techniques
involve the fabrication of biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds using 3D printing
technology, which can mimic the structure and properties of natural bone.

The scaffold serves as a temporary support structure that provides mechanical stability
and guides the growth of new bone tissue. It offers a three-dimensional framework with
interconnected pores that allow for cell infiltration, nutrient diffusion, and the deposition of
extracellular matrix.

Steps involved in scaffold-based 3D printing of bone
Design:

A digital model of the desired bone structure or defect is created using computer-aided design
(CAD) software. The design takes into account factors such as shape, size, pore architecture, and
mechanical properties.
