Database Management System [BCS403]

= The characteristics are :
+ The access mode
- can be specified as READ ONLY or READ WRITE
- The default is READ WRITE
- Amode of READ WRITE allows select, update, insert, delete, and create
commands to be executed
- Amode of READ ONLY, as the name implies, is simply for data retrieval.
+ The diagnostic area size
- DIAGNOSTIC SIZE n, specifies an integer value n, which indicates the
number of conditions that can be held simultaneously in the
diagnostic area
- These conditions supply feedback information (errors or exceptions) to the
user or program on the n most recently executed SQL statement

+ The isolation level
- specified using the statement ISOLATION LEVEL <isolation>, where the value for

<isolation> can be READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE
READ, or SERIALIZABLE
- The default isolation level is SERIALIZABLE
- The use of the term SERIALIZABLE here is based on not allowing violations that
cause dirty read, unrepeatable read, and phantoms
- lf atransaction executes at a lower isolation level than SERIALIZABLE, then one
or more of the following three violations may occur:

1. Dirty read. A transaction T1 may read the update of a transaction 72, which
has not yet committed. If 72 fails and is aborted, then 71 would have read a
value that does not exist and is incorrect.

2. Nonrepeatable read. A transaction 71 may read a given value from a table. If
another transaction 72 later updates that value and 71 reads that value again,
T1 will see a different value.

3. Phantoms. A transaction 71 may read a set of rows from a table, perhaps
based on some condition specified in the SQL WHERE-clause. Now suppose
that a transaction 72 inserts a new row that also satisfies the WHERE-clause
condition used in 71, into the table used by 71. If 71 is repeated, then 71 will

see a phantom, a row that previously did not exist.
