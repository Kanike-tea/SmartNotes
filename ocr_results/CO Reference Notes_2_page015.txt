Base with Index Mode
> Another version of the Index mode uses 2 registers which can be denoted as (Ri, Rj)
> Here, a second register may be used to contain the offset X.
> The second register is usually called the base register.
> The effective-address of the operand is given by EA=[Ri]+[Rj]
> This form of indexed addressing provides more flexibility in accessing
operands because both components of the effective-address can be changed.
Base with Index & Offset Mode
> Another version of the Index mode uses 2 registers plus a
constant, which can be denoted as X(Ri, Rj)
> The effective-address of the operand is given by
EA=X+{Ri]+[Rj]
> This added flexibility is useful in accessing multiple components inside each item in a
record, where the beginning of an item is specified by the (Ri, Rj) part of the addressing-
mode. In other words, this mode implements a 3-dimensional array.

RELATIVE MODE

> This is similar to index-mode with one difference:

> The effective-address is determined using the PC in place of the general purpose
register Ri.

> The operation is indicated as X(PC).

> X(PC) denotes an effective-address of the operand which is X locations above or below
the current contents of PC.

> Since the addressed-location is identified "relative" to the PC, the name Relative mode
is associated with this type of addressing.

> This mode is used commonly in conditional branch instructions.

> An instruction such as

Branch > 0 LOOP ;Causes program execution to go to the branch target location

identified by name LOOP if branch condition is satisfied.

ADDITIONAL ADDRESSING MODES
1) Auto Increment Mode
> Effective-address of operand is contents of a register specified in the instruction (Fig: 2.16).
> After accessing the operand, the contents of this register are automatically incremented to
point to the next item in a list.
> Implicitly, the increment amount is 1.
> This mode is denoted as
(Ri)+ where Ri=pointer-register.

2) Auto Decrement Mode
> The contents of a register specified in the instruction are first automatically decremented and are
then used as the effective-address of the operand.
> This mode is denoted as
-(Ri) ;where Ri=pointer-register.
