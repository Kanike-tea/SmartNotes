DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

e Associated with the array is a variable, top, which points to the top element in the stack.

Initially, top is set to -1 to denote an empty stack.

¢ we have specified that element is a structure that consists of only a key field.

1. CREATE STACK:

Stack CreateS(maxStackSize )::=

#define MAX_STACK_SIZE 100 /* maximum stack size*/

typedef struct
|
int key;
/* other fields */
} element;
element stack[MAX STACK SIZE];
int top

The element which is used to insert or delete is specified as.a structure that consists of
only akey field.

1. Boolean IsEmpty(Stack)::= top < 0;

2. Boolean IsFull(Stack)::= top >= MAX_STACK_SIZE-1;

The IsEmpty and IsFull operations are simple, and is implemented directly in the
program push and pop functions. Each of these functions assumes that the variables

stack and top are global.

Add an item tova stack

void add(int *top, element item)
{
/* add an item to the global stack */
if (*top >= MAX_STACK-STZF-1) {
stack—full();
return;
3
stack[++*top] = item;

}
¢ Function push() checks to see if the stack is full. If it is, it calls stackFull, which prints an
error message and terminates execution.

+ When the stack is not full, we increment top and assign item to stack[top].
