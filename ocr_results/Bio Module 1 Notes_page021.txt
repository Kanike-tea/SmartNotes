F. Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins

Lipids aid in the absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are essential for

various physiological functions.

G. Waterproofing and Lubrication

Waxes (e.g., in plants and animal skin) provide waterproofing.

Lipids help in lubrication (e.g., sebum in the skin).

Lipids are crucial for energy storage, cellular structures, metabolism, and overall health,

making them essential biomolecules for living organisms.

Engineering Applications of Lipids

1.

Cosmetics: Lipids are commonly used in cosmetics, such as moisturizers, to improve
skin hydration and texture.

Food industry: Lipids are used as ingredients in food products, such as margarine and
frying oils, to improve texture, flavor, and shelf life.

Medical devices: Lipids are used in medical devices, such as lipid-based drug delivery
systems, to improve the delivery and efficacy of drugs.

Biofuels: Lipids, such as vegetable oils and animal fats, can be converted into biofuels,
such as biodiesel and bioethanol, to provide a renewable source of energy.

Surface modification: Lipids can be used to modify the surface properties of
materials, such as metals and polymers, to improve their performance and
biocompatibility.

Surfactants: Lipids are used as surfactants, which are compounds that reduce surface

tension and improve the mixing of oil and water-based substances.

It is important to note that the properties and applications of lipids can vary depending on

the specific type of lipid and the processing method used. Further research is needed to fully

understand and harness the potential of lipids in engineering applications.

1.5 Enzymes:

Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in biological reactions. They speed up the rate of

chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. Enzymes are specific to the type of

reaction they catalyze, and they bind to specific substrates to facilitate the reaction. Enzymes

play a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, digestion, and cellular respiration.
