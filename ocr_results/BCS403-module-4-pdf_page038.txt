5.5 Characterizing Schedules Based on Recoverability
= schedule (or history): the order of execution of operations from all the various
transactions
= Schedules (Histories) of Transactions: A schedule S of n transactions T;, Ta,....... Th
is a sequential ordering of the operations of the n transactions.
— The transactions are interleaved
= Two operations in a schedule are said to conflict if they satisfy all three of the following
conditions:
(1) they belong to different transactions;
(2) they access the same item X; and
(3) at least one of the operations is a write_item(X)
= Conflicting operations:
+ 1(X) conflicts with w2(X) } Read write conflict
+ t2(X) conflicts with w:(X)
+ —wi(X) conflicts with wa(X) Write conflict
+ 1(X) do not conflicts with r2(X)

Schedules classified on recoverability:

= Recoverable schedule:
— One where no transaction needs to be rolled back.
- Aschedule S is recoverable ifno transaction T in S commits until all transactions
T that have written an item that T reads have committed.
— Example:
+ Sci i(X); wa(X); 2X); 1(Y); w2(X); C2; a4;
+ Sa: A(X); wa(X); 12(X); (Y); walX); wil); C1; C25

= Cascadeless schedule:
— One where every transaction reads only the items that are written by committed
transactions.
= Schedules requiring cascaded rollback:

— A schedule in which uncommitted transactions that read an item from a failed
transaction must be rolled back.
= Strict Schedules:
— A schedule in which a transaction can neither read or write an item X until the

last transaction that wrote X has committed.
