‘employee_id’ and input ‘2’ to the bind variable ‘password’ instead of directly pass-
ing string parameters.

Filtering Input (Input Validation). This technique can be used to remove escape
characters from input strings by using the SQL Replace function. For example, the
delimiter single quote (‘) can be replaced by two single quotes (°). Some SQL
manipulation attacks can be prevented by using this technique, since escape charac-
ters can be used to inject manipulation attacks. However, because there can be a
large number of escape characters, this technique is not reliable.

Function Security. Database functions, both standard and custom, should be
restricted, as they can be exploited in the SQL function injection attacks.

30.5 Introduction to Statistical
Database Security

Statistical databases are used mainly to produce statistics about various popula-
tions. The database may contain confidential data about individuals; this informa-
tion should be protected from user access. However, users are permitted to retrieve
statistical information about the populations, such as averages, sums, counts, maxi-
mums, minimums, and standard deviations. The techniques that have been devel-
oped to protect the privacy of individual information are beyond the scope of this
text. We will illustrate the problem with a very simple example, which refers to the
relation shown in Figure 30.3. This is a PERSON relation with the attributes Name,
Ssn, Income, Address, City, State, Zip, Sex, and Last_degree.

A population is a set of tuples of a relation (table) that satisfy some selection condi-
tion. Hence, each selection condition on the PERSON relation will specify a particu-
lar population of PERSON tuples. For example, the condition Sex = ‘M’ specifies the
male population; the condition ((Sex = ‘F)) AND (Last_degree = ‘M.S.’ OR Last_degree
= ‘Ph.D.’)) specifies the female population that has an M.S. or Ph.D. degree as their
highest degree; and the condition City = ‘Houston’ specifies the population that
lives in Houston.

Statistical queries involve applying statistical functions to a population of tuples.
For example, we may want to retrieve the number of individuals in a population
or the average income in the population. However, statistical users are not allowed
to retrieve individual data, such as the income of a specific person. Statistical
database security techniques must prohibit the retrieval of individual data. This
can be achieved by prohibiting queries that retrieve attribute values and by allowing
