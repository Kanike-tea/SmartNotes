2.Associative Mapping:

CBee 127 |

It is also called as associative mapped cache. It is much more flexible.

In this technique main memory block can be placed into any cache block
position.

In this case , 12 tag bits are required to identify a memory block when it is
resident of the cache memory.

The Associative Mapping technique is illustrated as shown in the fig.

In this technique 12 bits of address generated by the processor are compared with
the tag bits of each block of the cache to see if the desired block is present. This

is called as associative mapping technique.
