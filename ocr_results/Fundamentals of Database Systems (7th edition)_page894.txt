Guard conditions and
attributes lists for
fragments.

(a) Site 2 fragments.
(b) Site 3 fragments.

(a) EMPDS
attribute list: Fname, Minit, Lname, Ssn, Salary, Super_ssn, Dno
guard condition: Dno = 5
DEP5
attribute list: * (all attributes Dname, Dnumber, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date)
guard condition: Dnumber = 5
DEP5_LOCS
attribute list: * (all attributes Dnumber, Location)
guard condition: Dnumber = 5
PROJSS
attribute list: * (all attributes Pname, Pnumber, Plocation, Dnum)
guard condition: Dnum = 5
WORKS_ONS5
attribute list: * (all attributes Essn, Pno,Hours)
guard condition: Essn IN (tgs (EMPD5)) OR Pno IN (stpnumber (PROJSS))

(b) EMPD4
attribute list: Fname, Minit, Lname, Ssn, Salary, Super_ssn, Dno
guard condition: Dno = 4
DEP4
attribute list: * (all attributes Dname, Dnumber, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date)
guard condition: Dnumber = 4
DEP4_LOCS
attribute list: * (all attributes Dnumber, Location)
guard condition: Dnumber = 4
PROJS4
attribute list: * (all attributes Pname, Pnumber, Plocation, Dnum)
guard condition: Dnum = 4
WORKS_ON4
attribute list: * (all attributes Essn, Pno, Hours)
guard condition: Essn IN (gsn (EMPD4))
OR Pno IN (ttpnumber (PROJS4))

shown in Figure 23.2, we have the guard conditions and attribute lists shown in
Figure 23.5. When the DDBMS decomposes an update request, it can determine
which fragments must be updated by examining their guard conditions. For exam-
ple, a user request to insert a new EMPLOYEE tuple <‘Alex’, ‘B’, ‘Coleman’,
“345671239’, ‘22-APR-64’, ‘3306 Sandstone, Houston, TX’, M, 33000, ‘987654321’,
4> would be decomposed by the DDBMS into two insert requests: the first inserts
the preceding tuple in the EMPLOYEE fragment at site 1, and the second inserts the
projected tuple <‘Alex’, ‘B’, ‘Coleman’, ‘345671239’, 33000, ‘987654321’, 4> in the
EMPD4 fragment at site 3.

For query decomposition, the DDBMS can determine which fragments may contain
the required tuples by comparing the query condition with the guard conditions. For
