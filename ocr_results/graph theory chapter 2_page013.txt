By handshaking property, the left hand side of this inequality is equal to 2m, Where,

the number of edges in G. Thus, 2m > 6n, or 3n < m.
On the other hand, by result (ii) of Corollary 1, we should have m < 3n-6, Thus, 3, :

m < 3n- 6. This cannot be true.
Therefore, G must have a vertex of degree less than 6. :

Verify Euler’s formula for the planar graph shown in Figure 2.20.
> The given graph has n = 6 vertices, m = 10 edges and r = 6 regions. Thus,

n-m+r=6-10+6=2,

The Euler’s formula is thus verified for the given graph. 1

Verify Euler's formula for the planar graphs shown below:

So

(a) (b)
Figure 2.22

b> We observe that the first of the given graphs has n =
regions. Thus, n—m +r=17-34+19 2,

In the second of the given “graphs, there aren = 1
regions, so thatn -m+r=10-24416=2.

Thus, for both of the given graphs, Euler’s formula is verified. :

For the diagram of a planar graph shown below, find the degrees of regions and
verify that the sum of these degrees is equal to twice the numb
