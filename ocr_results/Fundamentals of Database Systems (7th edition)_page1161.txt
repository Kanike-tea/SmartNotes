30.2 Discretionary Access Control Based on Granting and Revoking Privileges

includes only those attributes and then grant SELECT on V to B. The same applies
to limiting B to retrieving only certain tuples of R; a view V’ can be created by
defining the view by means of a query that selects only those tuples from R that A
wants to allow B to access. We will illustrate this discussion with the example given
in Section 30.2.5.

30.2.3 Revoking of Privileges

In some cases, it is desirable to grant a privilege to a user temporarily. For example,
the owner of a relation may want to grant the SELECT privilege to a user for a spe-
cific task and then revoke that privilege once the task is completed. Hence, a mech-
anism for revoking privileges is needed. In SQL, a REVOKE command is included
for the purpose of canceling privileges. We will see how the REVOKE command is
used in the example in Section 30.2.5.

30.2.4 Propagation of Privileges Using the GRANT OPTION

Whenever the owner A of a relation R grants a privilege on R to another account B,
the privilege can be given to B with or without the GRANT OPTION. If the GRANT
OPTION is given, this means that B can also grant that privilege on R to other
accounts. Suppose that B is given the GRANT OPTION by A and that B then grants
the privilege on R to a third account C, also with the GRANT OPTION. In this way,
privileges on R can propagate to other accounts without the knowledge of the
owner of R. If the owner account A now revokes the privilege granted to B, all the
privileges that B propagated based on that privilege should automatically be revoked
by the system.

It is possible for a user to receive a certain privilege from two or more sources. For
example, A4 may receive a certain UPDATE R privilege from both A2 and A3. In such
acase, if A2 revokes this privilege from A4, A4 will still continue to have the privilege
by virtue of having been granted it from A3. If A3 later revokes the privilege from A4,
A4 totally loses the privilege. Hence, a DBMS that allows propagation of privileges
must keep track of how all the privileges were granted in the form of some internal
log so that revoking of privileges can be done correctly and completely.

30.2.5 An Example to Illustrate Granting and Revoking
of Privileges
Suppose that the DBA creates four accounts—A1, A2, A3, and A4—and wants only

At to be able to create base relations. To do this, the DBA must issue the following
GRANT command in SQL:

GRANT CREATETAB TO A1;

The CREATETAB (create table) privilege gives account A1 the capability to create
new database tables (base relations) and is hence an account privilege. This privi-
lege was part of earlier versions of SQL but is now left to each individual system
