Discuss the final result of the different schedules in Figures 20.3(a) and (b),
where M = 2 and N = 2, with respect to the following questions: Does adding
the above condition change the final outcome? Does the outcome obey the
implied consistency rule (that the capacity of X is 90)?

Repeat Exercise 20.14, adding a check in T, so that Y does not exceed 90.

Add the operation commit at the end of each of the transactions T; and T)
in Figure 20.2, and then list all possible schedules for the modified transac-
tions. Determine which of the schedules are recoverable, which are cascade-
less, and which are strict.

List all possible schedules for transactions T, and T, in Figure 20.2, and
determine which are conflict serializable (correct) and which are not.

How many serial schedules exist for the three transactions in Figure 20.8(a)?
What are they? What is the total number of possible schedules?

Write a program to create all possible schedules for the three transactions
in Figure 20.8(a), and to determine which of those schedules are conflict
serializable and which are not. For each conflict-serializable schedule,
your program should print the schedule and list all equivalent serial
schedules.

Why is an explicit transaction end statement needed in SQL but not an
explicit begin statement?

Describe situations where each of the different isolation levels would be use-
ful for transaction processing.

Which of the following schedules is (conflict) serializable? For each serializ-
able schedule, determine the equivalent serial schedules.

a. ry(X)5 r3(X)5 wi(X)5 r(X)s w3(X)s

b. ry(X)5 r3(X)5 w3(X)5 4 (X)5 19(X)s

cc. 73(X)5 r(X)53 w3(X)5 7(X)s 4 (X)5

dl. r3(X)5 r2(X)5 71 (X)s w3(X)s wi (X)5

Consider the three transactions T), T2, and T3, and the schedules S; and S;
given below. Draw the serializability (precedence) graphs for S; and S,, and
state whether each schedule is serializable or not. If a schedule is serializable,
write down the equivalent serial schedule(s).

Ty: ry (X)s ry (Z)s wy (X)5
