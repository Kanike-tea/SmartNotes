Data Structures and Applications(BCS304) Module 2

e Initially when front=0 rear=0 i.e when front == rear the queue is empty now after 6 insertions
are made again fron=0 and rear= 0 that is the queue is full. So, we cannot distinguish between
an empty and a full queue.

To avoid the resulting confusion, the value of the rear is incremented before we check for the
condition front == rear for queue overflow.

= aS = aS

e To add an element to a full queue, we must first increase the size of this array using a function
such as realloc.

As with dynamically allocated stacks, we use array doubling. However, it isn't sufficient to
simply double array size using realloc.

Consider the full queue . This figure shows a queue with seven elements in an array whose
capacity is 8. To visualize array doubling when a circular queue is used, the array is flattened
out as shown in the array of Figure (b).
