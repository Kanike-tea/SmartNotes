>» RIGHT OUTER JOIN
Every tuple in right table must appear in result

If no matching tuple
Padded with NULL values for the attributes of left table

» FULL OUTER JOIN
a full outer join combines the effect of applying both left and right outer
joins.

Where records in the FULL OUTER JOINed tablesido not match, the
result set will have NULL values for every column of the table\thatdacks
a matching row.

For those records that do match, a single row will be produced in the
result set (containing fields populated from.both tables),

Not all SQL implementations have implemented the new
syntax of joined tables.

In some systems, a different syntax was used to specify outer
joins by using the comparison operators +=, =+, and +=+ for
left, right, and full outer join, respectively

For-example, this syntax is available in Oracle. To specify the
left outer join. in Q8B using this syntax, we could write the
query Q8C as follows:

v

v

v

asc: SELECT E.Lname, S.Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE S
WHERE E.Super_ ssn += S.Ssn;
