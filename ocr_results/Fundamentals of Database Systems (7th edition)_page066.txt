36 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

2.2 Three-Schema Architecture
and Data Independence

Three of the four important characteristics of the database approach, listed in
Section 1.3, are (1) use of a catalog to store the database description (schema) so
as to make it self-describing, (2) insulation of programs and data (program-data
and program-operation independence), and (3) support of multiple user views.
In this section we specify an architecture for database systems, called the
three-schema architecture,’ that was proposed to help achieve and visualize
these characteristics. Then we discuss further the concept of data independence.

2.2.1 The Three-Schema Architecture

The goal of the three-schema architecture, illustrated in Figure 2.2, is to separate
the user applications from the physical database. In this architecture, schemas can
be defined at the following three levels:

1. The internal level has an internal schema, which describes the physical
storage structure of the database. The internal schema uses a physical data
model and describes the complete details of data storage and access paths for
the database.

“This is also known as the ANSI/SPARC (American National Standards Institute/ Standards Planning
And Requirements Committee) architecture, after the committee that proposed it (Tsichritzis & Klug, 1978).
