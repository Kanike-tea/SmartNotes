Chapter 15 Relational Database Design Algorithms and Further Dependencies

attibutes within a relation completely and succinctly, and the minimal cover allows
us to do it. Second, we discuss the desirable properties of nonadditive (lossless)
joins and preservation of functional dependencies. A general algorithm to test for
nonadditivity of joins among a set of relations is presented. Third, we present an
approach to relational design by synthesis of functional dependencies. This is a
bottom-up approach to design that presupposes that the known functional depen-
dencies among sets of attributes in the Universe of Discourse (UoD) have been
given as input. We present algorithms to achieve the desirable normal forms,
namely 3NF and BCNF, and achieve one or both of the desirable properties of non-
additivity of joins and functional dependency preservation. Although the synthesis
approach is theoretically appealing as a formal approach, it has not been used in
practice for large database design projects because of the difficulty of providing all
possible functional dependencies up front before the design can be attempted.
Alternately, with the approach presented in Chapter 14, successive decompositions
and ongoing refinements to design become more manageable and may evolve over
time. The final goal of this chapter is to discuss further the multivalued dependency
(MVD) concept we introduced in Chapter 14 and briefly point out other types of
dependencies that have been identified.

In Section 15.1 we discuss the rules of inference for functional dependencies and
use them to define the concepts of a cover, equivalence, and minimal cover among
functional dependencies. In Section 15.2, first we describe the two desirable
properties of decompositions, namely, the dependency preservation property
and the nonadditive (or lossless) join property, which are both used by the design
algorithms to achieve desirable decompositions. It is important to note that it is
insufficient to test the relation schemas independently of one another for compli-
ance with higher normal forms like 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF. The resulting relations
must collectively satisfy these two additional properties to qualify as a good design.
Section 15.3 is devoted to the development of relational design algorithms that
start off with one giant relation schema called the universal relation, which is a
hypothetical relation containing all the attributes. This relation is decomposed (or
in other words, the given functional dependencies are synthesized) into relations
that satisfy a certain normal form like 3NF or BCNF and also meet one or both of
the desirable properties.

In Section 15.5 we discuss the multivalued dependency (MVD) concept further by
applying the notions of inference, and equivalence to MVDs. Finally, in Sec-
tion 15.6 we complete the discussion on dependencies among data by introducing
inclusion dependencies and template dependencies. Inclusion dependencies can
represent referential integrity constraints and class/subclass constraints across rela-
tions. We also describe some situations where a procedure or function is needed to
state and verify a functional dependency among attributes. Then we briefly discuss
domain-key normal form (DKNF), which is considered the most general normal
form. Section 15.7 summarizes this chapter.

It is possible to skip some or all of Sections 15.3, 15.4, and 15.5 in an introductory
database course.
