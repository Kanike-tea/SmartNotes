Database Management System [BCS403]

An entity type describes the schema or intension for a set of entities that share the same structure.
The collection of entities of a particular entity type is grouped into an entity set, which is also
called the extension of the entity type.

An entity type is represented in ER diagrams a rectangular box enclosing the entity type name.
Attribute names are enclosed in ovals and are attached to their entity type by straight lines.
Composite attributes are attached to their component attributes by straight lines. Multivalued

attributes are displayed in double ovals

Key Attributes of an Entity Type

An entity type usually has one or more attributes whose values are distinct for each individual
entity in the entity set. Such an attribute is called a key attribute, and its values can be used to
identify each entity uniquely. For example, the Name attribute is a key of the COMPANY entity
because no two companies are allowed to have the same name.

In ER diagrammatic notation, each key attribute has its name underlined inside the oval.Some
entity types have more than one key attribute. For example, each of the Vehicle_id and

Registration attributes of the entity type CAR is a key in its own right

Example: The CAR entity type with two key attributes, Registration and Vehicle_id.

Value Sets (Domains) of Attributes

Each simple attribute of an entity type is associated with a value set (or domain of values), which
specifies the set of values that may be assigned to that attribute for each individual entity. For
example, if the range of ages allowed for employees is between 16 and 70, we can specify the
value set of the Age attribute of EMPLOYEE to be the set of integer numbers between 16 and 70.
