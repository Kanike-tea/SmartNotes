but equivalent, forms. Boolean expressions may be simplified by algebraic means. However, this
procedure of minimization is awkward because it lacks specific rules to predict each succeeding step in
the manipulative process. The map method presented here provides a simple, straightforward procedure
for minimizing Boolean functions. This method may be regarded as a pictorial form of a truth table. The

map method is also known as the Karnaugh map or K-map.

A K-map is a diagram made up of squares, with each square representing one minterm of the function
that is to be minimized. Since any Boolean function can be expressed as a sum of minterms, it follows
that a Boolean function is recognized graphically in the map from the area enclosed by those squares

whose minterms are included in the function.

The simplified expressions produced by the map are always in one of the two standard forms: sum of
products or product of sums. s. It will be assumed that the simplest algebraic expression is an algebraic
expression with a minimum number of terms and with the smallest possible number of literals in each
term. This expression produces a circuit diagram with a minimum number of gates and the minimum

number of inputs to each gate.
Two-Variable K-Map

The two-variable map is shown in Fig(a). There are four minterms for two variables; hence, the map
consists of four squares, one for each minterm. The map is redrawn in (b) to show the relationship
between the squares and the two variables x and y. The 0 and | marked in each row and column designate
the values of variables. Variable x appears primed in row 0 and unprimed in row 1. Similarly, y appears
primed in column 0 and unprimed in column 1. If we mark the squares whose minterms belong to a
given function, the two-variable map becomes another useful way to represent any one of the 16 Boolean
functions of two variables. As an example, the function xy is shown in Fig(c). Since xy is equal to m3,
a | is placed inside the square that belongs to m3. Similarly, the function x + y is represented in the map

of Fig(d) by three squares marked with 1’s. These squares are found from the minterms of the function:

ml+m2+m3=x'y+xy'+xy=xty
