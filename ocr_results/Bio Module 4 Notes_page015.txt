and a water-splitting enzyme.

Sunlight energy is used to split water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen ions (H*) and oxygen (O2)
through a process called photolysis.

The hydrogen ions (H*) generated from water splitting combine with electrons from an external
source (e.g., a wire) to form hydrogen gas (H2).

The oxygen gas (Oz) produced during water splitting is released into the atmosphere.

The generated hydrogen gas (H2) can be collected and stored for later use as a clean and
renewable energy source.

The bionic leaf also absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air or a supplied source.

The absorbed carbon dioxide (CO2) is converted into carbon-based compounds, such as formic
acid or methane, through a reduction reaction.

The carbon-based compounds can be used as a fuel or converted into other useful chemicals.

The bionic leaf operates in a closed-loop system, where the produced oxygen (O2) during water
splitting is reused by the catalyst in subsequent cycles.

Applications of Bionic Leaf Technology
Here are some applications of bionic leaf technology:

e Renewable Energy Production: One of the primary applications of bionic leaf technology
is in the production of renewable energy. Bionic leaf systems can harness solar energy
and convert it into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen gas or other carbon-based
fuels. These fuels can be used as clean energy sources for various applications, including
transportation, electricity generation, and heating.

e Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Bionic leaf technology offers a promising solution for
mitigating the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. By capturing and
utilizing carbon dioxide as a feedstock, bionic leaf systems can potentially help reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. This application holds significant
potential for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) strategies.

e Sustainable Chemical Production: Bionic leaf systems can be utilized for sustainable
chemical production. By utilizing carbon dioxide and renewable energy, these systems
can produce a wide range of valuable chemicals, such as fertilizers, plastics, and
