12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts

are applicable to objects of all types. For example, in the relational model, the oper-
ations for selecting, inserting, deleting, and modifying tuples are generic and may
be applied to any relation in the database. The relation and its attributes are visible
to users and to external programs that access the relation by using these opera-
tions. The concept of encapsulation is applied to database objects in ODBs by
defining the behavior of a type of object based on the operations that can be exter-
nally applied to objects of that type. Some operations may be used to create (insert)
or destroy (delete) objects; other operations may update the object state; and oth-
ers may be used to retrieve parts of the object state or to apply some calculations.
Still other operations may perform a combination of retrieval, calculation, and
update. In general, the implementation of an operation can be specified in a
general-purpose programming language that provides flexibility and power in
defining the operations.

The external users of the object are only made aware of the interface of the oper-
ations, which defines the name and arguments (parameters) of each operation.
The implementation is hidden from the external users; it includes the definition
of any hidden internal data structures of the object and the implementation of the
operations that access these structures. The interface part of an operation is
sometimes called the signature, and the operation implementation is sometimes
called the method.

For database applications, the requirement that all objects be completely encapsu-
lated is too stringent. One way to relax this requirement is to divide the structure of
an object into visible and hidden attributes (instance variables). Visible attributes
can be seen by and are directly accessible to the database users and programmers
via the query language. The hidden attributes of an object are completely encapsu-
lated and can be accessed only through predefined operations. Most ODMSs
employ high-level query languages for accessing visible attributes. In Section 12.5
we will describe the OQL query language that is proposed as a standard query lan-
guage for ODBs.

The term class is often used to refer to a type definition, along with the definitions
of the operations for that type.® Figure 12.2 shows how the type definitions in Fig-
ure 12.1 can be extended with operations to define classes. A number of operations
are declared for each class, and the signature (interface) of each operation is
included in the class definition. A method (implementation) for each operation
must be defined elsewhere using a programming language. Typical operations
include the object constructor operation (often called new), which is used to create
a new object, and the destructor operation, which is used to destroy (delete) an
object. A number of object modifier operations can also be declared to modify the
states (values) of various attributes of an object. Additional operations can retrieve
information about the object.

8This definition of class is similar to how it is used in the popular C++ programming language. The
ODMG standard uses the word interface in addition to class (see Section 12.3). In the EER model, the
term class was used to refer to an object type, along with the set of all objects of that type (see
Chapter 8).
