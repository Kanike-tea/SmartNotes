A is the root node

B is the parent of E and F

C and D are the sibling of B

E and F are the children of B

K, L, F, G, M, I, J are external nodes, or leaves
A, B,C, D, E, H are internal nodes

The level of E is 3

The height (depth) of the tree is 4

The degree of node B is 2

The degree of the tree is 3

The ancestors of node M is A, D, H
The descendants of node D is H, I, J,M

Representation of Trees

There are several ways to represent a given tree such as:

Figure (A)

1. List Representation
2. Left Child- Right Sibling Representation
3. Representation as a Degree-Two tree
