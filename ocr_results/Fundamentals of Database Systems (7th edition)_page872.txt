Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts

systems, which focus on providing distributed solutions to manage the vast amounts
of data that are needed in applications such as social media, healthcare, and security,
to name a few. Chapter 25 introduces the concepts and systems being used for pro-
cessing and analysis of big data, such as map-reduce and other distributed process-
ing technologies. We also discuss cloud computing concepts in Chapter 25.

Section 23.1 introduces distributed database management and related concepts.
Issues of distributed database design, involving fragmenting and sharding of data
and distributing it over multiple sites, as well as data replication, are discussed in
Section 23.2. Section 23.3 gives an overview of concurrency control and recovery in
distributed databases. Sections 23.4 and 23.5 introduce distributed transaction pro-
cessing and distributed query processing techniques, respectively. Sections 23.6 and
23.7 introduce different types of distributed database systems and their architec-
tures, including federated and multidatabase systems. The problems of heterogene-
ity and the needs of autonomy in federated database systems are also highlighted.
Section 23.8 discusses catalog management schemes in distributed databases. Sec-
tion 23.9 summarizes the chapter.

For a short introduction to the topic of distributed databases, Sections 23.1 through
23.5 may be covered and the other sections may be omitted.

23.1 Distributed Database Concepts

We can define a distributed database (DDB) as a collection of multiple logically
interrelated databases distributed over a computer network, and a distributed
database management system (DDBMS) as a software system that manages a dis-
tributed database while making the distribution transparent to the user.

23.1.1 What Constitutes a DDB

For a database to be called distributed, the following minimum conditions should
be satisfied:

= Connection of database nodes over a computer network. There are mul-
tiple computers, called sites or nodes. These sites must be connected by an
underlying network to transmit data and commands among sites.

= Logical interrelation of the connected databases. It is essential that the
information in the various database nodes be logically related.

= Possible absence of homogeneity among connected nodes. It is not neces-
sary that all nodes be identical in terms of data, hardware, and software.

The sites may all be located in physical proximity—say, within the same building or a
group of adjacent buildings—and connected via a local area network, or they may be
geographically distributed over large distances and connected via a long-haul or wide
area network. Local area networks typically use wireless hubs or cables, whereas
long-haul networks use telephone lines, cables, wireless communication infrastruc-
tures, or satellites. It is common to have a combination of various types of networks.
