¢ Memory Cycle Time: It is the minimum time delay that required between the initiation of the two
successive memory-operations.

RAM (Random Access Memory)

¢ In RAM, any location can be accessed for a Read/Write-operation in fixed amount of time,

Cache Memory
> It is a small, fast memory that is inserted between
— larger slower main-memory and
— processor.
> It holds the currently active segments of a program and their data.

Virtual Memory
> The address generated by the processor is referred to as a virtual/logical address.
> The virtual-address-space is mapped onto the physical-memory where data are actually
stored.
> The mapping-function is implemented by MMU. (MMU = memory management unit).
> Only the active portion of the address-space is mapped into locations in the physical-memory.
> The remaining virtual-addresses are mapped onto the bulk storage devices such as magnetic disk.
> As the active portion of the virtual-address-space changes during program execution, the
MMU
— changes the mapping-function &
— transfers the data between disk and memory.
> During every memory-cycle, MMU determines whether the addressed-page is in the memory. If
the page is in the memory.
Then, the proper word is accessed and execution proceeds.
Otherwise, a page containing desired word is transferred from disk to memory.
* Memory can be classified as follows:
1) RAM which can be further classified as follows:
i) Static RAM
ii) Dynamic RAM (DRAM) which can be further classified as synchronous & asynchronous
DRAM.
2) ROM which can be further classified as follows:
i) PROM
ii) EPROM
iii) EEPROM &
iv) Flash Memory which can be further classified as Flash Cards & Flash Drives.

SEMI CONDUCTOR RAM MEMORIES
INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF MEMORY-CHIPS
¢ Memory-cells are organized in the form of array (Figure 8.2).
¢ Each cell is capable of storing 1-bit of information.
¢ Each row of cells forms a memory-word.
¢ All cells of a row are connected to a common line called as Word-Line.
© The cells in each column are connected to Sense/Write circuit by 2-bit-lines.
© The Sense/Write circuits are connected to data-input or output lines of the chip.
© During a write-operation, the sense/write circuit
— receive input information &
— store input info in the cells of the selected word.
