256 Chapter 7 Optimized Primitives

7.9 SUMMARY

ARM instructions only implement simple primitives such as addition, subtraction, and
multiplication. To perform more complex operations such as division, square root, and
trigonometric functions, you need to use software routines. There are many useful tricks
and algorithms to improve the performance of these complex operations. This chapter
covered the algorithms and code examples for a number of standard operations.

Standard tricks include

= using binary search or trial subtraction to calculate small quotients

= using Newton-Raphson iteration for fast calculation of reciprocals and extraction of
roots

= using a combination of table lookup followed by series expansion to calculate
transcendental functions such as exp, log, sin, and cos

= using logical operations with barrel shift to perform bit permutations, rather than
testing bits individually

= using multiply accumulate instructions to generate pseudorandom numbers
