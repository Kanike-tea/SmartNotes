other than e and g which corresponds to the smallest entry is d or f. Let us choose d and
ect d to the edge {e, g} at e.*
Let us now examine the d—row and note that a'smallest entry, 2, corresponds to f. Thus.
the edge (fd). i oe
At this stage, all vertices, except c, are included in the edges. Among the edges having c
as an end vertex, the edges {c, e} and {c, g} have equal minimum weight, 3. We can consider
either of these edges. We stop the process, because we have exhausted all vertices.
According to this process the six edges that form a minimal spanning tree of the given
graph are (4, b}, {b, e}, fe, 8}, {d, e}, (f, d} and either {c, e} or {c, g}. In the first case, the minimal
ing tree is the same as that got in Example 3 (by the Kruskal’s method) and is shown
Figure 4.8. In the second case, the minimal spanning tree is as shown in Figure 4.197.

Mead can choose f instead of d. In that case we obtain a different minimal spanning tree.
