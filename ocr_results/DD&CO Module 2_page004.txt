Implementation of full adder in sum-of-products form

It can also be implemented with two half adders and one OR gate, as shown in Fig below. The S output
from the second half adder is the exclusive-OR of z and the output of the first half adder, giving

= 70 (x@y)

= 2z'(xy’ +.x'y) + z(xy’ + x'y)!

= z'(xy’ + x'y) + z(xy + x’y’)

= xy'z' + x'yz

+ xyz + x'y'z

C= z(xy' + x'y) + xy = xy'z + x'yz + xy

(x@®y)z+xy

Binary Adder

A binary adder is a digital circuit that produces the arithmetic sum of two binary numbers. It can be
constructed with full adders connected in cascade, with the output carry from each full adder connected
to the input carry of the next full adder in the chain. Addition of n-bit numbers requires a chain of n full
