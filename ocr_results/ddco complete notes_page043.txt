Implement the following boolean function using 3:8 decoder
SG y, z) = Ld, 2, 4, 7)
C(x, y, 2) = ©G, 5, 6,7)

Since there are three inputs and a total of eight minterms, we need a three-to-eight-line decoder.

FIGURE 4.21
Implementation of a full adder with a decoder
ren ~ NN
The decoder generates the eight minterms for sand z . The ate for output S forms the logical sum

of minterms 1, 2,4, and 7. The OR gate for ou! C forms the 1

Exemplify(Implement) the following function using 3:8 decoder
i) f(a,b, e,d)=Ym (L.2, 3.4) \
ii) f(a.b, c, d)=Ym (35,7 )

sum of minterms 3, 5,6, and 7.

Encoder

+ An encoder is a digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of a decoder.
