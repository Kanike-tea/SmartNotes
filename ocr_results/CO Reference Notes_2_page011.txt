+ Instead, the instruction provides information from which the new address of the operand can
be determined.
* This address is called Effective Address (EA) of the operand.
Indirect Mode
* The EA of the operand is the contents of a register(or memory-location).
* The register (or memory-location) that contains the address of an operand is called a Pointer .
+ We denote the indirection by
— name of the register or
— new address given in the instruction.
E.g: Add (R1),RO ;The operand is in memory. Register R1 gives the effective-address (B) of the
operand. The data is read from location B and added to contents of
register RO.

> To execute the Add instruction in fig 2.11 (a), the processor uses the value which is in register
R1, as the EA of the operand.

> It requests a read operation from the memory to read the contents of location B. The value
read is the desired operand, which the processor adds to the contents of register RO.

> Indirect addressing through a memory-location is also possible as shown in fig 2.11(b). In this
case, the processor first reads the contents of memory-location A, then requests a second read
operation using the value B as an address to obtain the operand.

Figure 2.12 Use of indirect addressing in the program of Figure 2.10.

Program Explanation
+ In above program, Register R2 is used as a pointer to the numbers in the list, and the operands
are accessed indirectly through R2.
* The initialization-section of the program loads the counter-value n from memory-location N into R1
and uses the immediate addressing-mode to place the address value NUM1, which is the address of the
first number in the list, into R2. Then it clears RO to 0.
+ The first two instructions in the loop implement the unspecified instruction block starting at LOOP.
* The first time through the loop, the instruction Add (R2), RO fetches the operand at location NUM1
and adds it to RO.
* The second Add instruction adds 4 to the contents of the pointer R2, so that it will contain the
