PART B

Program 01: Write an algorithm and python program to find the sum of ‘N’ natural
numbers.

ALGORITHM

1. Read the value of N.

2. Initialize a variable sum to 0.

3. Set a loop variable i to 1.

4. Repeat steps 5 and 6 while i is less than or equal to N.
5. Addi to sum.

6. Increment i by 1.

7. Print the value of sum as the sum of the first N natural numbers.

PROGRAM
Here's a Python program that calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers:

def sum_of_natural_numbers (n)
if n <= 0:
return "N should be a positive integer."

sum = 0
for iin range(1, ntl):
sum += i

return sum

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
result = sum_of_natural_numbers (n)
print ("Sum of the first", n, "natural numbers:", result)

OUTPUT

//Output 01

Enter a positive integer: 5

Sum of the first 5 natural numbers: 15

//Output 02
Enter a positive integer: 20
Sum of the first 20 natural numbers: 210

//Output 03

Enter a positive integer: -10
Sum of the first -10 natural numbers: N should be a positive integer.
