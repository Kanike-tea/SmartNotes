Four-input priority encoder

Multiplexer

«A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of many input lines
and directs it to a single output line

* The selection of a particular input line is controlled by a set of selection lines

* normally, there are 2" input lines and n selection lines whose bit combinations determine which input is

selected.
