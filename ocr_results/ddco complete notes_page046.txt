that an output with all 0’s is generated when all the inputs are 0; but this output is the same as when DO is
equal to 1. The discrepancy can be resolved by providing one more output to indicate whether at least one

input is equal to 1.
Priority Encoder

* A priority encoder is an encoder circuit that includes the priority function.
* The operation of the priority encoder is such that if two or more inputs are equal to 1 at the same
time, the input having the highest priority will take precedence.

* The truth table of a four-input priority encoder is given in Table 4.8

Do Di Dz OD; x y Vv
0 0 0 0 Xx Xx 0

Xx 1 0 0 0 1 1
x x 1 0 1 0 1
x x x 1 1 1 1

+ In addition to the two outputs x and y , the circuit has a third output designated by V ; this is a
valid bit indicator that is set to 1 when one or more inputs are equal to 1.

+. If all inputs are O, there is no valid input and V is equal to 0. The other two outputs are not
inspected when V equals 0 and are specified as don’t-care conditions.

* Input D3 has the highest priority, so, regardless of the values of the other inputs, when this input is
1, the output for xy is 11 (binary 3).

* D2 has the next priority level. The output is 10 if D2 = 1, provided that D3 = 0, regardless of the
values of the other two lower priority inputs. The output for D1 is generated only if higher priority

inputs are 0.
