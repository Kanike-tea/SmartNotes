10.3 SUMMARY

This chapter covered the firmware. We defined firmware as the low-level code that interfaces
the hardware with an application or operating system. We also defined the bootloader as
the software that loads an operating system or application into memory and relinquishes
control of the pc to that software.

We introducted the ARM Firmware Suite and RedBoot. The ARM Firmware Suite is
designed only for ARM-based systems. RedBoot, however, is more generic and can be used
on other, non-ARM processors.

Next we looked at a firmware example called Sandstone. Sandstone initializes the
hardware and then loads and boots an image following this procedure:

= Takes the Reset exception.

= Starts initializing the hardware; sets the system register’s base address and initializes
segment display hardware.

= Remaps memory; ROM address = high addr and SRAM addr = 0x00000000.
= Initializes the communication hardware output on the serial port.

= Bootloader—toads an image into SRAM and relinquishes control of the peto the image
(pe = 0x00000000).

We now have a fully initialized ARM7TDMI embedded system.
