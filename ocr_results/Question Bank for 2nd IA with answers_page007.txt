* Pupil: The pupil is a small opening in the iris. The iris controls the size of the pupil. The pupil’s function
is to adjust the amount of light entering the eye.

+ Lens: The transparent portion situated behind the pupil is called the lens (convex lens which thicker at
the center than the edges). It focusses all the light at one point. The lens alters the shape to focus light on
the retina, with the help of ciliary muscles. It becomes small to focus on objects at a distance and becomes
big to focus on nearby objects.

+ Retina: It’s the inner boundary of the eye. It is the light-sensitive layer that consists of nerve cells. Its
function is to convert the images formed by the lens into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses are
then transmitted through optic nerves to the brain.

* Optic Nerves: Light coming from retina is sensed by the nerve cells. You can find two types of optic
nerves, which are cones and rods.

1. Cones: Cones are the nerve cells that are more sensitive to bright light. Cones help in central and colour
vision.

2. Rods: Rods are the nerve cells that are more sensitive to dim lights. Rodes help in peripheral vision.

The message or sensation is then transferred to the brain along the optic nerve.

8. Heart is an effective pump. Justify

Ans. The human heart functions as a powerful and efficient pump that maintains continuous circulation of blood

throughout the body. It is a muscular, four-chambered organ that plays a vital role in the circulatory system.

Key Features That Make the Heart an Effective Pump:

. Muscular Structure:

o The walls of the heart, especially the left ventricle, are made of cardiac muscle, which is strong and

capable of contracting with great force to push blood throughout the body.

2. Chambered Design:

o The heart has four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle.
o The atria receive blood, and the ventricles pump it out, ensuring separation of oxygenated and

leoxygenated blood.

3. Valves to Prevent Backflow:

o The tricuspid valve, bicuspid (mitral) valve, pulmonary valve, and aortic valve ensure unidirectional

flow of blood and prevent backflow.

4. Double Circulation:

o The heart supports double circulation:

= Pulmonary circulation (right side): Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs.

= Systemic circulation (left side): Pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.
