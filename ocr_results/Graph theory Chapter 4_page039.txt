For the existence of a complete matching from’V; to V2 it is necessary that the number of

(2)
vertices in V2 is greater than or equal to the number of vertices in Vi.

3) A complete matching from.V;, to Vz, does;not exist if V2 has lesser number of vertices
than Vi. me

The following theorem, known as’ Hall’s Theorem, provides a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of a complete matching.

Theorem 1 . Ina bipartite graph G = G(V,, V2; E), a complete matching from V, to V2 exists
ifand only if every subset of k vertices in Vj is collectively adjacent to k or more vertices in V2,
forall possible values of k.

The proof of the theorem is beyond the scope of this text. But we will illustrate it.

Prove that the bipartite graph shown in Figure 4.63 does not have a complete
matching from V, to V2.

Figure 4.63

> We observe that the three vertices v1, v2, V3 in V) are together joined to two vertices a), a2, in

V Thus, there is a subset of 3 vertices in V; which is collectively adjacent to 2 (< 3) vertices

Vo,

i Hence, by Hall’s theorem, there does not exist a complete matching from V, to V2 (although
2has more vertices than Vi): ; .
