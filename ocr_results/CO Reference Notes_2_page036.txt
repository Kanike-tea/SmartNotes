¢ Data-lines P7 through PO can be used for either input or output purposes (Figure 4.34).
¢ For increased flexibility,
— some lines can be used as inputs and
— some lines can be used as outputs.
¢ The DATAOUT register is connected to data-lines via 3-state drivers that are controlled by a DDR.
The processor can write any 8-bit pattern into DDR. (DDR > Data DirectionRegister).
¢ If DDR=1,
Then, data-line acts as an
output-line; Otherwise, data-
line acts as an input-line.
¢ Two lines, C1 and C2 are used to control the interaction between interface-circuit and 1/0
device. Two lines, C1 and C2 are also programmable.
¢ Line C2 is bidirectional to provide different modes of signaling, including the handshake.
¢ The Ready and Accept lines are the handshake control lines on the processor-bus
side. Hence, the Ready and Accept lines can be connected to Master-ready and Slave-
ready.
¢ The input signal My-address should be connected to the output of an address-
decoder. The address-decoder recognizes the address assigned to the interface.
¢ There are 3 register select lines: RSO-RS2.
Three register select lines allows up to eight registers in the interface.
¢ An interrupt-request INTR is also provided.
INTR should be connected to the interrupt-request line on the computer-bus.

STANDARD I/O INTERFACE
© Consider a computer system using different interface standards.
Let us look in to Processor bus and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus (Figure 4.38).
© These two buses are interconnected by a circuit called Bridge.
¢ The bridge translates the signals and protocols of one bus into another.
¢ The bridge-circuit introduces a small delay in data transfer between processor and the devices.

© The 3 major standard I/O interfaces are:

1) PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)

2) SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)

3) USB (Universal Serial Bus)
© PCI defines an expansion bus on the motherboard.
¢ SCSI and USB are used for connecting additional devices both inside and outside the computer-box.
¢ SCSI bus is a high speed parallel bus intended for devices such as disk and video display.
© USB uses a serial transmission to suit the needs of equipment ranging from keyboard to game
control to internal connection.
¢ IDE (Integrated Device Electronics) disk is compatible with ISA which shows the connection to
an Ethernet.
