APPENDIX

INSTRUCTION
CYCLE TIMINGS

This appendix lists the instruction cycle timings for some common ARM implementions.
Timings can vary between different revisions of an implementation and are also affected by
external events such as interrupts, memory speed, and cache misses. You should treat these
numbers as a guide only and verify performance measurements on real hardware. Refer to
the manufacturer’s data sheets for the latest timing information.

ARM cores use pipelined implementations. The number of cycles that an instruction
takes may depend on the previous and following instructions. When you optimize code,
you need to be aware of these interactions, described in the “Notes” column of the timing
tables.

D.1 USING THE INSTRUCTION CYCLE TIMING TABLES

Use the following steps to calculate the number of cycles taken by an instruction:

= Use Table C.3 in Appendix C to find which ARM core you are using. For example,
ARM7xx parts usually contain an ARM7TDMI core; ARM9xx parts, an ARM9TDMI
core; and ARM9xxE, parts an ARM9E core.

= Find the table in this appendix for the ARM core you are using.

= Find the relevant instruction class in the left-hand column of the table. The class “ALU”
is shorthand for all of the arithmetic and logical instructions: ADD, ADC, SUB, RSB, SBC,
RSC, AND, ORR, BIC, EOR, CMP, CMN, TEQ, TST, MOV, MVN, CLZ.
