Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

efficient access for the original queries and transactions that the database was
designed to handle, it did not provide enough flexibility to access records efficiently
when new queries and transactions were identified. In particular, new queries that
required a different storage organization for efficient processing were quite difficult
to implement efficiently. It was also laborious to reorganize the database when
changes were made to the application’s requirements.

Another shortcoming of early systems was that they provided only programming
language interfaces. This made it time-consuming and expensive to implement
new queries and transactions, since new programs had to be written, tested, and
debugged. Most of these database systems were implemented on large and
expensive mainframe computers starting in the mid-1960s and continuing
through the 1970s and 1980s. The main types of early systems were based on
three main paradigms: hierarchical systems, network model-based systems, and
inverted file systems.

1.7.2 Providing Data Abstraction and Application Flexibility
with Relational Databases

Relational databases were originally proposed to separate the physical storage of
data from its conceptual representation and to provide a mathematical foundation
for data representation and querying. The relational data model also introduced
high-level query languages that provided an alternative to programming language
interfaces, making it much faster to write new queries. Relational representation of
data somewhat resembles the example we presented in Figure 1.2. Relational sys-
tems were initially targeted to the same applications as earlier systems, and pro-
vided flexibility to develop new queries quickly and to reorganize the database as
requirements changed. Hence, data abstraction and program-data independence
were much improved when compared to earlier systems.

Early experimental relational systems developed in the late 1970s and the com-
mercial relational database management systems (RDBMS) introduced in the
early 1980s were quite slow, since they did not use physical storage pointers or
record placement to access related data records. With the development of new
storage and indexing techniques and better query processing and optimization,
their performance improved. Eventually, relational databases became the domi-
nant type of database system for traditional database applications. Relational data-
bases now exist on almost all types of computers, from small personal computers
to large servers.

1.7.3 Object-Oriented Applications and the Need
for More Complex Databases
The emergence of object-oriented programming languages in the 1980s and the

need to store and share complex, structured objects led to the development of
object-oriented databases (OODBs). Initially, OODBs were considered a competitor
