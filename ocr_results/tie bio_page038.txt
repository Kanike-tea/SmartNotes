More advanced AI diagnostics are coming soon

The application of Machine Learning in diagnostics is just beginning — more ambitious
systems involve the combination of multiple data sources (CT, MRI, genomics and
proteomics, patient data, and even handwritten files) in assessing a disease or its progression.

Al won’t replace doctors anytime soon-

It’s unlikely that AI will replace doctors outright. Instead, AI systems will be used to
highlight potentially malignant lesions or dangerous cardiac patterns for the expert —
allowing the doctor to focus on the interpretation of those signals.

11. Briefly explain self-healing-bio concrete.
Answer:

Concrete as one of the most commonly used construction materials, plays an indispensable
role in many fields. It has been widely used in the construction of buildings, dams, storage
tanks, sea-ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, subways and other infrastructures. Concrete is
mainly a combination of water, aggregate (coarse and fine), and cement

The bacteria used for self-healing of cracks are acid-producing bacteria. The bacteria act as a
catalyst in the crack healing process. It is preferred when the concrete structure have access to
water or moisture.

When the cracks appear in the concrete, the water seeps in the cracks, the spores of bacteria
germinate and starts feeding on the calcium lactate are converted to insoluble limestone, the
insoluble limestone starts to harden us filling automatically without any external aid

Various bacteria used are as following:
* bacillus pseudofirmus
* bacillus balodurans
* bacillus cohnil
* bacillus paterurizing
* bacillus spaericus

* escherichia coil
