« Flexible Schema: Easily add new types of nodes and relationships without
restructuring the database.

« Intuitive Data Modeling: The graph model aligns naturally with how people think
about relationships.

e Scalable and Performant: Neo4j supports horizontal scaling (with some limitations)
and clustering for enterprise-grade applications.

In summary, NoSQL graph databases, especially Neo4j, provide an optimal solution for
managing and querying highly connected data. Their ability to represent complex
networks in a natural and efficient manner makes them essential for modern applications
that rely on data relationships as a core feature.
