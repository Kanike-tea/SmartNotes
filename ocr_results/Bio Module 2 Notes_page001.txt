cellulose, which reduces their impact on the environment compared to synthetic polymer

filters.

Cost-effective: Cellulose-based water filters are often more affordable than traditional
synthetic polymer filters, making them accessible to a wider range of consumers and

communities.

Renewable resource: Cellulose-based water filters are made from a renewable resource,

cellulose, reducing the dependency on non-renewable resources.

Good mechanical strength: Cellulose-based water filters have good mechanical

strength, allowing them to maintain their structure and perform effectively over time.

Chemical resistance: Cellulose-based water filters are resistant to most chemicals,
including acids and bases, and can be used in a wide range of water treatment

applications.

Large surface area: Cellulose-based water filters have a large surface area, which

enhancestheir filtration capabilities and reduces the frequency of filter replacement.

Construction of cellulose-based water filters

Cellulose Material Selection: depend on the desired properties such as strength,
porosity, and chemical resistance. Common cellulose materials include paper, cotton,

and wood fibers.

Cellulose Preparation: The cellulose material is prepared by cutting it into small

pieces, washing it to remove impurities, and drying it for use.

Cellulose Layer Formation: The cellulose material is formed into a layer by either

stacking it or compacting it using heat and pressure.

Filter Medium Attachment: The cellulose layer is attached to a filter medium such as

a mesh or a support structure to provide stability and increase the filter surface area.

Chemical Treatment: The cellulose layer may be chemically treated to modify its

properties, such as increasing its hydrophilicity or adding antimicrobial agents.

Housing Assembly: The filter medium is assembled into a housing that provides a

means to attach it to a water source and to collect the filtered water.

Filter Testing: The completed filter is tested to ensure that it meets the desired

specifications, such as filtration efficiency and flow rate.
