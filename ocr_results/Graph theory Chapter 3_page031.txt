3.4 Prefix codes and Weighted trees

Recall that a sequence is a set whose elements are listed (arranged) in order as the first element,
——— + 3 hex

second element, third element, and so-on::The number-of elements contained in a sequence is
called its length.

A sequence consisting of only 0 and 1 is.called a binary sequence or a binary string.
Thus,

01,001, 101, 11001, 1000100

are all binary sequences with,léngths 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, tespectively.. inna Legal
Binary sequences ‘are used as codes for messages sent through transmitting channels.

Suppose a message consisting of the letters a, e,n, r, tis to be transmitted. Suppose we use

the following coding scheme for these letters: ms

a:1, €:0, n:10, r:01, t= 101.

ee RLY |
Under this coding scheme, suppose the message eat is to be transmitted. Then, the code!
form of the message is given by the binary sequence 01101. Now, the question is: ca? a
binary sequence be decoded correctly (without ambiguity)? The answer is: No!. Becavs¢
sequence 01101 can be decoded not only as ear but also as rt, or rar, or eaar (for example
Accordingly, the coding shemdgintscoted above is of no use int fradamissions.

Alternatively, suppose Wezse the rate coding schemes’

).

Then, the message eat is to be transmitted as the binary sequence 0101100, We can check #
this sequence, when decoded, yields only éaf-anid'ab'other message.
