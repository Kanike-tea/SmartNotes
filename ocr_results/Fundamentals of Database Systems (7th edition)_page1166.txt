attribute’s value. Assume that the Name attribute is the apparent key, and consider the
query SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE. A user with security clearance S would see the same
relation shown in Figure 30.2(a), since all tuple classifications are less than or equal to
S. However, a user with security clearance C would not be allowed to see the values for
Salary of ‘Brown’ and Job_performance of ‘Smith’, since they have higher classification.
The tuples would be filtered to appear as shown in Figure 30.2(b), with Salary and
Job_performance appearing as null. For a user with security clearance U, the filtering
allows only the Name attribute of ‘Smith’ to appear, with all the other attributes appear-
ing as null (Figure 30.2(c)). Thus, filtering introduces null values for attribute values
whose security classification is higher than the user’s security clearance.

In general, the entity integrity rule for multilevel relations states that all attributes
that are members of the apparent key must not be null and must have the same
security classification within each individual tuple. Additionally, all other attribute
values in the tuple must have a security classification greater than or equal to that of
the apparent key. This constraint ensures that a user can see the key if the user is
permitted to see any part of the tuple. Other integrity rules, called null integrity
and interinstance integrity, informally ensure that if a tuple value at some security
level can be filtered (derived) from a higher-classified tuple, then it is sufficient to
store the higher-classified tuple in the multilevel relation.
