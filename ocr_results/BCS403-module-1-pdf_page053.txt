Database Management System [BCS403]

whenever supplier s can supply part p (to any project). USES between PROJECT and PART,
includes an instance ( j, p) whenever project j uses part p. SUPPLIES between SUPPLIER and
PROJECT, includes an instance (s, j) whenever supplier s supplies some part to project j.

Some database design tools are based on variations of the ER model that permit only binary
relationships. In this case, a ternary relationship such as SUPPLY must be represented as a weak

entity type, with no partial key and with three identifying relationships.

The three participating entity types SUPPLIER, PART, and PROJECT are together the owner
entity types.Hence, an entity in the weak entity type is identified by the combination of its three
owner entities from SUPPLIER, PART, and PROJECT.

3.7.2 Constraints on Ternary (or Higher-Degree) Relationships
There are two notations for specifying structural constraints on n-ary relationships
1. based on the cardinality ratio notation of binary relationships displayed
- 1, M, or N is specified on each participation arc (both M and N' symbols stand for
many or any number)
2. based on the (min, max) notation
- specifies that each entity is related to at least min and at most max relationship

instances in the relationship set
