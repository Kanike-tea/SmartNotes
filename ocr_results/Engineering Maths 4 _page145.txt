Geometrical representation of z = x+ iy (Argand diagram)

We plot the point P(x, y) inthe x-y plane and draw PM perpendicular to the. -
X-axis. , .

Let OP=r and POM = 8. From the figure wehave »- |:

cos0 =~, sing = 4 , ,

r r

x =rcos®, y=rsin@ ‘
Eliminating @ (by squaring and adding) andr (by dividing) we obtain, :

ety =P and y/x = tan® :
or r=Vi+% and = tan”! (y/x)
i z=x+iy = r(cosO+isin@) '
Since cos@+isin@ = e® z=, 0 is called the polar form of z,

r= Vx+ ¥ is called the modulus of z and 0 = tan! (y/x) is called the
amplitude of z or argument of z, Symbolically we write these as follows.
Izlsr=Vxt4y and ampz or argz = 0 = tan”! (y/x)
