called not valid, and a state that satisfies all the constraints in the defined set of
integrity constraints IC is called a valid state.

In Figure 5.5, the Dnumber attribute in both DEPARTMENT and DEPT_LOCATIONS
stands for the same real-world concept—the number given to a department. That
same concept is called Dno in EMPLOYEE and Dnum in PROJECT. Attributes that
represent the same real-world concept may or may not have identical names in dif-
ferent relations. Alternatively, attributes that represent different concepts may have
the same name in different relations. For example, we could have used the attribute
name Name for both Pname of PROJECT and Dname of DEPARTMENT; in this case, we
would have two attributes that share the same name but represent different real-
world concepts—project names and department names.

In some early versions of the relational model, an assumption was made that the
same real-world concept, when represented by an attribute, would have identical
attribute names in all relations. This creates problems when the same real-world
concept is used in different roles (meanings) in the same relation. For example, the
concept of Social Security number appears twice in the EMPLOYEE relation of
Figure 5.5: once in the role of the employee’s SSN, and once in the role of the
supervisor's SSN. We are required to give them distinct attribute names—Ssn and
Super_ssn, respectively—because they appear in the same relation and in order to
distinguish their meaning.

Each relational DBMS must have a data definition language (DDL) for defining a
relational database schema. Current relational DBMSs are mostly using SQL for
this purpose. We present the SQL DDL in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.
