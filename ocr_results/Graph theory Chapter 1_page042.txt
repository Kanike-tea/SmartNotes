3. Isomorphism

is ar aa on si : Pair of vertices of degree 4 which are not adjacent whereas
° secon grap! , a pair of vertices of degree 4 which are adjacent. (The reader is required
identify them!). Therefore the two graphs are not isomorphic .

tas) Show that two graphs need not be isomorphic even if they have the same number
¥ vertices, the same number of edges and equal number of vertices with the same degree.
Consider the two graphs shown in Figure 1.55:

vs v6 A BC @Q

(a) (b)
Figure 1.55

We observe that both graphs have the same (6) number of vertices and the same (5) number
edges. Further, in each of them there are 3 vertices of degrée 1 (namely, v1, vs, V6 in the
t graph and A, P, R in the second graph), there are 2 vertices of degree 2 (namely, v2, v3 in
e first graph and B, Q in the second graph), and there is 1 vertex of degree 3 (namely, v4 in
he first graph and C in the second graph). Thus, the two graphs have equal number of vertices

vith the same degree.

But, the two graphs are not isomorphic. Because there are 2 pendant vertices adjacent to the
ertex v4 (which is of degree 3) in the first graph but there is only one pendant vertex adjacent
0 the vertex C (which is of degree 3) in the second graph. As such, the adjacency of vertices
annot be preserved under a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the graphs. =
REINS) Ler G = G(V,B) and G' = GV", E’) be two graphs and f : G.— G' be an
‘omorphism. Prove the following:

@) f-! : G@ = G is also an isomorphism.

tl) For any vertex v in G, deg(v) in G = deg(f(v)) in G’.
