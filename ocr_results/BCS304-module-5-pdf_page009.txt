Directory less Dynamic hashing

Basic Idea:
¢ Pages are split when overflows occur — but not necessarily the page with the overflow.

¢ Directory avoided in Linear hashing by using overflow pages. (chaining approach)
¢ Splitting occurs in turn, in a round robin fashion.one by one from the first bucket to
the last bucket.
¢ Use a family of hash functions hO, h1, h2, ...

* Each function’s range is twice that of its predecessor.
¢ When all the pages at one level (the current hash function) have been split, a new
level is applied.
¢ Insert in Order using linear hashing: 1,7,3,8,12,4,11,2,10

¢ After insertion till 12:

s => 0}

* When 4 inserted overflow occurred. So we split the bucket (no matter it is full or partially
empty). And increment pointer.

* So we split bucket 0 and rehashed all keys in it. Placed 3 to new bucket as hl (3 mod 6 = 3 ) and (12
mod 6=0 ). Then 11 and 2 are inserted. And now overflow. s is pointing to bucket 1, hence split bucket 1
by re- hashing it.
