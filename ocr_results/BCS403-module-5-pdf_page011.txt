Starvation.
Another problem that may occur when we use locking is starvation, which occurs
when a transaction cannot proceed for an indefinite period of time while other
transactions in the system continue normally.
This may occur if the waiting scheme for locked items is unfair, giving priority to
some transactions over others
One solution for starvation is to have a fair waiting scheme, such as using a first-
come-first-served queue; transactions are enabled to lock an item in the order in
which they originally requested the lock.
Another scheme allows some transactions to have priority. over others but
increases the priority of a transaction the longer it waits, until it eventually gets the
highest priority and proceeds.
Starvation can also occur because of victim selection if the algorithm selects the
same transaction as victim repeatedly, thus causing it to abort and never finish
execution.
The algorithm can use higher priorities for transactions that have been aborted

multiple times to avoid this problem.

guarantees serializability using transaction timestamps to order transaction execution
for an equivalent serial schedule

5.13.1 Timestamps

https://vtucode.in

timestamp is a unique identifier created by the DBMS to identify a transaction.
Typically, timestamp values are assigned in the order in which the transactions are
submitted to the system, so a timestamp can be thought of as the transaction start
time.
We will refer to the timestamp of transaction T as TS(7).
Concurrency control techniques based on timestamp ordering do not use
locks;hence, deadlocks cannot occur.
Timestamps can be generated in several ways.

— One possibility is to use a counter that is incremented each time its value is

assigned to a transaction. The transaction timestamps are numbered 1, 2, 3,
