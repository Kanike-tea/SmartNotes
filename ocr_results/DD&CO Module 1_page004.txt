Theorem 3:

THEOREM 3: (x’')' = x. From postulate 5, we have x + x’ = 1 and x-x’' = 0, which
together define the complement of x. The complement of x’ is x and is also (x’)’.

Theorem 6(a): Theorem 6(b):
x+xy=x. x(x + y) = x by duality.
Statement Justification

xtxy=x-l + xy postulate 2(b)

=x(1 + y) (a)

= x(y + 1) 3(a)

=x-l 2(a)

=x 2(b)

The theorems of Boolean algebra can be proven by means of truth tables. In truth tables, both sides of
the relation are checked to see whether they yield identical results for all possible combinations of the

variables involved. The following truth table verifies the first absorption theorem:

xily xy | x+xy
0/0 0 0
0} 1 0 0

The algebraic proofs of the associative law and DeMorgan’s theorem are long and will not be shown
here. However, their validity is easily shown with truth tables. For example, the truth table for the first
DeMorgan’s theorem, (x + y)= xy, is as follows:

x y |x+y| (x+y) x ly’ | xy’

Operator Precedence

The operator precedence for evaluating Boolean expressions is (1) parentheses, (2) NOT, (3) AND, and
(4) OR. In other words, expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated before all other operations.
The next operation that holds precedence is the complement, and then follows the AND and, finally, the
OR. As an example, consider the truth table for one of DeMorgan’s theorems. The left side of the

expression is (x + y). Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first and the result
