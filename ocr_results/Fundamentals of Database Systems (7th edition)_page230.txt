Chapter 6 Basic SQL

want to create a table DSEMPS with a similar structure to the EMPLOYEE table
and load it with the rows of employees who work in department 5, we can write
the following SQL:

CREATE TABLE DS5EMPS LIKE EMPLOYEE

(SELECT Ef
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E
WHERE E.Dno = 5) WITH DATA;

The clause WITH DATA specifies that the table will be created and loaded with
the data specified in the query, although in some implementations it may be
left out.

6.4.2 The DELETE Command

The DELETE command removes tuples from a relation. It includes a WHERE
clause, similar to that used in an SQL query, to select the tuples to be deleted.
Tuples are explicitly deleted from only one table at a time. However, the deletion
may propagate to tuples in other relations if referential triggered actions are spec-
ified in the referential integrity constraints of the DDL (see Section 6.2.2).
Depending on the number of tuples selected by the condition in the WHERE
clause, zero, one, or several tuples can be deleted by a single DELETE command. A
missing WHERE clause specifies that all tuples in the relation are to be deleted;
however, the table remains in the database as an empty table. We must use the
DROP TABLE command to remove the table definition (see Chapter 7). The
DELETE commands in U4A to U4D, if applied independently to the database state
shown in Figure 5.6, will delete zero, one, four, and all tuples, respectively, from
the EMPLOYEE relation:

U4A: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Lname = ‘Brown’;

U4B: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Ssn = 123456789;

U4C: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dno =5;

U4D: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE;

6.4.3 The UPDATE Command

The UPDATE command is used to modify attribute values of one or more selected
tuples. As in the DELETE command, a WHERE clause in the UPDATE command
selects the tuples to be modified from a single relation. However, updating a pri-
mary key value may propagate to the foreign key values of tuples in other rela-
tions if such a referential triggered action is specified in the referential integrity

'20ther actions can be automatically applied through triggers (see Section 26.1) and other mechanisms.
