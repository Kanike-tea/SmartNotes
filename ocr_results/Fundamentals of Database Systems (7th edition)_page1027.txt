26.4 Multimedia Database Concepts

related to the perceptual aspects of image content. These features are easy to extract
and represent, and it is convenient to design similarity measures based on their
statistical properties.

Color is one of the most widely used visual features in content-based image retrieval
since it does not depend upon image size or orientation. Retrieval based on color
similarity is mainly done by computing a color histogram for each image that iden-
tifies the proportion of pixels within an image for the three color channels (red,
green, blue—RGB). However, RGB representation is affected by the orientation of
the object with respect to illumination and camera direction. Therefore, current
image retrieval techniques compute color histograms using competing invariant
representations such as HSV (hue, saturation, value). HSV describes colors as
points in a cylinder whose central axis ranges from black at the bottom to white at
the top with neutral colors between them. The angle around the axis corresponds to
the hue, the distance from the axis corresponds to the saturation, and the distance
along the axis corresponds to the value (brightness).

Texture refers to the patterns in an image that present the properties of homogene-
ity that do not result from the presence of a single color or intensity value. Examples
of texture classes are rough and silky. Examples of textures that can be identified
include pressed calf leather, straw matting, cotton canvas, and so on. Just as pictures
are represented by arrays of pixels (picture elements), textures are represented by
arrays of texels (texture elements). These textures are then placed into a number of
sets, depending on how many textures are identified in the image. These sets not only
contain the texture definition but also indicate where in the image the texture is
located. Texture identification is primarily done by modeling it as a two-dimensional,
gray-level variation. The relative brightness of pairs of pixels is computed to estimate
the degree of contrast, regularity, coarseness, and directionality.

Shape refers to the shape of a region within an image. It is generally determined by
applying segmentation or edge detection to an image. Segmentation is a region-
based approach that uses an entire region (sets of pixels), whereas edge detection is
a boundary-based approach that uses only the outer boundary characteristics of
entities. Shape representation is typically required to be invariant to translation,
rotation, and scaling. Some well-known methods for shape representation include
Fourier descriptors and moment invariants.

26.4.2 Object Recognition in Images

Object recognition is the task of identifying real-world objects in an image or a
video sequence. The system must be able to identify the object even when the
images of the object vary in viewpoints, size, scale, or even when they are rotated
or translated. Some approaches have been developed to divide the original image
into regions based on similarity of contiguous pixels. Thus, in a given image
showing a tiger in the jungle, a tiger subimage may be detected against the back-
ground of the jungle, and when compared with a set of training images, it may be
tagged as a tiger.
