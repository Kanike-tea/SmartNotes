4.8.2 Perflourocarbons (PFCs)

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are a type of human blood substitute that are designed to deliver
oxygen to the body's tissues. Unlike hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), which are
based on natural proteins, PFCs are synthetic chemicals that are similar in structure to some
types of industrial solvents.

Advantages of PFCs
High oxygen-carrying capacity:

PFCs have the ability to dissolve a significant amount of oxygen, much higher than that of
blood. This allows for efficient oxygen delivery to tissues, even in low-oxygen
environments.

Improved oxygen solubility:

PFCs exhibit a high solubility for oxygen, meaning that oxygen molecules can readily
dissolve in PFC solutions. This enables PFCs to transport and deliver oxygen more
effectively than other alternatives.

Stability and long shelf life:

PFCs are chemically stable and have a long shelf life, making them suitable for storage and
use in emergency situations where the availability of fresh blood or other oxygen carriers
may be limited.

No blood typing or cross-matching required:

Unlike blood transfusions, which require compatibility testing and matching of blood types,
PFCs are not dependent on blood typing. This makes them potentially universal oxygen
carriers, suitable for use in individuals of any blood type.

Reduced risk of infection transmission:

PFCs are synthetic substances, eliminating the risk of transmitting infectious diseases associated
with blood transfusions. This advantage can be particularly significant in situations where the
availability of safe blood products is limited or in areas with a high prevalence of blood-borne
infections.

Compatibility with diagnostic tests:

PFCs do not interfere with laboratory diagnostic tests, allowing for accurate interpretation of
test results without potential complications from the presence of PFCs.

Limitations of PFCs
Limited oxygen offloading:

‘While PFCs have a high capacity to carry and dissolve oxygen, they tend to have a reduced
ability to release oxygen to tissues compared to red blood cells. This can result in inefficient
oxygen delivery, especially in situations where oxygen demand is high or oxygen tension in
tissues is low.

Need for specialized administration methods:
