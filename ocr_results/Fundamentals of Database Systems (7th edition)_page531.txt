that this relation is not in 3NF. Then argue from your knowledge of 2NF,
why it is not even in 2NF.

14.35. Consider the relation:

BOOK (Book_Name, Author, Edition, Year)

with the data:

Laboratory Exercises

IBook_Name Author Edition |Copyright_Year
IDB_fundamentals INavathe 4 2004
IDB_fundamentals [Elmasri 4 2004
IDB_fundamentals [Elmasri 5 2007
IDB_fundamentals INavathe 5 2007

a. Based on a common-sense understanding of the above data, what are the

possible candidate keys of this relation?

b. Justify that this relation has the MVD {Book} —» {Author} | {Edition, Year}.

c. What would be the decomposition of this relation based on the above
MVD? Evaluate each resulting relation for the highest normal form it

possesses.

14.36. Consider the following relation:

TRIP (Trip_id, Start_date, Cities_visited, Cards_used)

This relation refers to business trips made by company salespeople. Suppose
the TRIP has a single Start_date but involves many Cities and salespeople
may use multiple credit cards on the trip. Make up a mock-up population of

the table.

a. Discuss what FDs and/or MVDs exist in this relation.

b. Show how you will go about normalizing the relation.

Laboratory Exercises

Note: The following exercises use the DBD (Data Base Designer) system that is

described in the laboratory manual.

The relational schema R and set of functional dependencies F need to be coded as

lists. As an example, R and F for this problem are coded as:

R=[ahcodefgh i,j]

F=[[la, b),[el],
