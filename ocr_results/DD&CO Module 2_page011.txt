Combinational Logic Implementation using Decoders

The procedure for implementing a combinational circuit by means of a decoder and OR gates requires
that the Boolean function for the circuit be expressed as a sum of minterms. This procedure will be
illustrated by an example that implements a full-adder circuit.

Consider the truth table of Full adder-
Full Adder

we obtain the functions for the combinational circuit in sum-of-minterms form
S(x,y, z) = =(1,2,4,7)
C(x, y,z) = &(3,5, 6,7)

Since there are three inputs and a total of eight minterms, we need a three-to-eight-line decoder. The
implementation is shown in Fig below. The decoder generates the eight minterms for x, y, and z. The
OR gate for output S forms the logical sum of minterms 1, 2, 4, and 7. The OR gate for output C forms
the logical sum of minterms 3, 5, 6, and 7.

Implementation of a full adder with a decoder

Exercise:

Using a decoder and external gates, design the combinational circui defined by the
following three Boolean functions:

(a) Fy = x'yz’ + xz (b) Fy = (y' + x)z
F, = xy'z' + x'y F,=y'z'+x'y + yz’
F; = x'y'z' + xy F;= (x+y)z
