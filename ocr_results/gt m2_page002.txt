more edges than h. This process can be repeated until we obtain a closed walk
that traverses all the edges of G. Thus G is an Euler graph. =

Konigsberg Bridge Problem: Now looking at the graph of the Kénigsberg
bridges (Fig. 1-5), we find that not all its vertices are of even degree. Hence, it is
not an Euler graph. Thus it is not possible to walk over each of the seven bridges
exactly once and return to the starting point.

One often encounters Euler lines in various puzzles. The problem common to
these puzzles is to find how a given picture can be drawn in one continuous line
without retracing and without lifting the pencil from the paper. Two such
pictures are shown in Fig. 2-12. The drawing in Fig. 2-12(a) is called
Mohammed’s scimitars and is believed to have come from the Arabs. The one in
Fig. 2-12(b) is, of course, the star of David. (Equal time!)

In defining an Euler line some authors drop the requirement that the walk be
closed. For example, the walka1c2d3a4b5d6e7 bin Fig. 2-13, which
includes all the edges of the graph and does not retrace any edge, is not closed.
The initial vertex is a and the final vertex is b. We shall call such an open walk
that includes (or traces or covers) all edges of a graph without retracing any edge
a unicursal line or an open Euler line. A (connected) graph that has a unicursal
line will be called a unicursal graph.
