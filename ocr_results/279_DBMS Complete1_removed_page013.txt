of all persons who are customers at a given bank.

Attributes:
An entity is represented by a set of attributes. Attributes are descriptive properties possessed by
each member of an entity set.

Customer is an entity and its attributes are customerid, custmername, custaddress etc.
An attribute as used in the E-R model, can be characterized by the following attribute types.

a) Simple and Composite Attribute:

Simple attributes are the attributes which can’t be divided into sub parts, e.g. customerid, empno
Composite attributes are the attributes which can be divided into subparts, e.g. name consisting of
first name, middle name, last name and address consisting of city, pincode, state.

b) Single-Valued and Multi-Valued Attribute:

The attribute having unique value is single —valued attribute, e.g. empno, customerid, regdno etc.
The attribute having more than one value is multi-valued attribute, eg: phone-no, dependent name,
vehicle.

c) Derived Attribute:

The values for this type of attribute can be derived from the values of existing attributes, e.g. age
which can be derived from currentdate — birthdate and experience_in_year can be calculated as
currentdate-joindate.

d) NULL Valued Attribute:
The attribute value which is not known to user is called NULL valued attribute.

Relationship Set.
A relationship is an association among several entities. A relationship set is a set of relationships of

the same type. Formally, it is a mathematical relation on n>=2 entity sets. If Ei, Ex...En are entity
sets, then a relation ship set R is a subset of

{(€1,€2,...en) |ev€ E:, e2 € Eo.., en © En}
where (€1,€2,...€n) is a relation ship.

customer loan

Consider the two entity sets customer and loan. We define the relationship set borrow to denote the
association between customers and the bank loans that the customers have.

Mapping Cardinalities:

Mapping cardinalities or cardinality ratios, express the number of entities to which another entity
can be associated via a relationship set. Mapping cardinalities are most useful in describing binary
relationship sets, although they can contribute to the description of relationship sets that involve
more than two entity sets. For a binary relationship set R between entity sets A and B, the mapping
