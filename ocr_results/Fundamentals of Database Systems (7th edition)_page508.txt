= The domain of Dlocations contains sets of values and hence is nonatomic. In
this case, Dnumber — Dlocations because each set is considered a single mem-
ber of the attribute domain.'°

In either case, the DEPARTMENT relation in Figure 14.9 is not in 1NF; in fact, it does
not even qualify as a relation according to our definition of relation in Section 3.1.
There are three main techniques to achieve first normal form for such a relation:

1. Remove the attribute Dlocations that violates 1NF and place it in a separate
relation DEPT_LOCATIONS along with the primary key Dnumber of
DEPARTMENT. The primary key of this newly formed relation is the combi-
nation {Dnumber, Dlocation}, as shown in Figure 14.2. A distinct tuple in
DEPT_LOCATIONS exists for each location of a department. This decom-
poses the non-1NF relation into two 1NF relations.

'ln this case we can consider the domain of Dlocations to be the power set of the set of single
locations; that is, the domain is made up of all possible subsets of the set of single locations
