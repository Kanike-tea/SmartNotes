1. Stability: Biosensors can be affected by environmental conditions, such as temperature
and pH, which can lead to degradation of the biological recognition element and loss
of sensitivity.

2. Interferences: Biosensors can be affected by other substances in the sample, which can
interfere with the performance of the biosensor.

3. Calibration: Biosensors may require frequent calibration to ensure accuracy, which
can increase the time and cost associated with using the biosensor.

4. Limited shelf-life: Biosensors have a limited shelf-life, and the biological recognition
element may degrade over time, leading to decreased sensitivity and specificity.

5. Complexity: Biosensors can be complex to manufacture and use, requiring specialized

equipment and expertise to operate effectively.

Despite these limitations, biosensors have proven to be a valuable tool in various industries

and applications, and research is ongoing to improve their performance and reduce limitations.

Lignolytic Enzyme in Bio-Bleaching
Bio-Bleaching: An Eco-Friendly Alternative to Chemical Bleaching
1. What is Bio-Bleaching?

Bio-bleaching is the process of using microbial enzymes instead of harsh chemicals to remove
color and impurities from materials like paper pulp, textiles, and laundry. This eco-friendly
method reduces the use of chlorine and other toxic substances, making it a sustainable

alternative in industries.

2. How Bio-Bleaching Works

Microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) produce enzymes that break down natural pigments,

lignin, and stains. The most commonly used enzymes are:

Laccases — Break down lignin in wood pulp and remove stains from textiles.
Xylanases -— Help in bleaching paper pulp by _ breaking hemicellulose.
Manganese Peroxidases & Lignin Peroxidases — Degrade lignin, making bleaching more
effective.

Proteases & Lipases — Used in detergent formulations to remove protein- and fat-based

stains in laundry.
