Suppose that we use the deferred update protocol for the example in Fig-
ure 22.6. Show how the log would be different in the case of deferred update
by removing the unnecessary log entries; then describe the recovery process,
using your modified log. Assume that only REDO operations are applied,
and specify which operations in the log are redone and which are ignored.

How does checkpointing in ARIES differ from checkpointing as described
in Section 22.1.4?

How are log sequence numbers used by ARIES to reduce the amount of
REDO work needed for recovery? Illustrate with an example using the infor-
mation shown in Figure 22.5. You can make your own assumptions as to
when a page is written to disk.

What implications would a no-steal/force buffer management policy have
on checkpointing and recovery?

Choose the correct answer for each of the following multiple-choice questions:

22.31.

Incremental logging with deferred updates implies that the recovery system
must

a. store the old value of the updated item in the log

b. store the new value of the updated item in the log

c. store both the old and new value of the updated item in the log

d. store only the Begin Transaction and Commit Transaction records in the log

The write-ahead logging (WAL) protocol simply means that
a. writing of a data item should be done ahead of any logging operation

b. the log record for an operation should be written before the actual data is
written

c. alllog records should be written before a new transaction begins execution
d. the log never needs to be written to disk

In case of transaction failure under a deferred update incremental logging
scheme, which of the following will be needed?

a. an undo operation

b. a redo operation

c. an undo and redo operation

d. none of the above

For incremental logging with immediate updates, a log record for a transac-
tion would contain

a. a transaction name, a data item name, and the old and new value of the item
b. a transaction name, a data item name, and the old value of the item

c. a transaction name, a data item name, and the new value of the item

d. a transaction name and a data item name
