Rotate Right (ROR): Bits shifted out of the right end are wrapped around and inserted at the left end.
The last bit rotated goes into the C flag97 .
Rotate Right with Extend (RRX): Operates as a rotate right by one bit position, with the Carry flag

being shifted into the most significant bit and the least significant bit being shifted into the Carry
flag97 .

The amount of shift can be an immediate value specified in the instruction or the value in another
register98 . Using the barrel shifter can achieve fast multiplications or divisions by powers of 296 ....
For example, MOV r7, r5, LSL #2 effectively multiplies the content of r5 by 4 and stores the result in
1796 .

Working of Reverse Subtraction (RSB) and Comparison with Carry

Reverse Subtraction (RSB): The RSB instruction performs a subtraction where the operands are
reversed compared to the standard SUB instruction67 .... The syntax is RSB{<cond>}{S} Rd, Rn, N,
which performs the operation Rd = N - Rn, where N can be an immediate value or a register (possibly
with a shift operation)66 .... For example, RSB r0, r1, #0 subtracts the value in register r1 from 0 and
stores the result in r0, effectively negating the value in r199 . Like other data processing instructions,
the 'S' suffix can be used to update the condition flags in the cpsr based on the result of the
operation64 ....

Comparison Instructions and Carry: Comparison instructions like CMP, TST, and TEQ compare or test
a register with a 32-bit value70 .... They update the condition flags (N, Z, C, V) in the cpsr based on
the result of an implicit arithmetic or logical operation, but do not affect the registers themselves70

CMP Rn, N: Performs a subtraction of N from Rn and updates the flags, but the result is discarded.
The Carry flag (C) is set if a borrow does not occur (i.e., Rn = N for unsigned numbers) and cleared if a
borrow does occur (Rn <N)65.

TST Rn, N: Performs a bitwise AND operation between Rn and N and updates the flags (N, Z, C), but
the result is discarded. The C flag is typically set from the result of the barrel shift if used65 .

TEQ Rn, N: Performs a bitwise Exclusive OR operation between Rn and N and updates the flags (N, Z,
C), but the result is discarded. The C flag is typically set from the result of the barrel shift if used65 .
