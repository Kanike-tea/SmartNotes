than a pointer to the record represented. The leaf nodes the first record in each run. An
additional node, node Ohas been added to represent the overall winner of the tournament.
Following the output of the overall winner, the tree is by playing along the path from node 11
to node 1The records with which these tournaments are to be played are readily available from

the parent nodes. As a result, sibling nodes along the path from 11 to 1 are not accessed.

4.3: Forest
Definition: A forest is a set of n> 0 disjoint trees. When we remove the root of a

tree we obtain a forest. For example, removing the root of any binary tree produces a forest of

4.3.1: Transforming a forest into a binary tree

Definition: If T;, . . ., Tn is a forest of trees, then the binary tree corresponding to this forest,
denoted by B(Ti,..., Tn),

(1) is empty, ifn =0

(2) has root equal to root (T;); has left subtree equal to B(T);,Ti2. . . Tim), where Ti,---,r1m
are the subtrees of root (T;); and has right subtree B(T», . . . ,Tn)
