Let P, Q, R, S, T represent five cricket teams. Suppose that the teams P, Q, R

have played one game with each other, and the teams P, S, T have played one game with each
other. Represent this situation in a graph.

Hence determine (i) the teams that have not played with each other, and (ii) the number of
games played by each team.

> Let the teams be represented by vertices and an edge Tepresent the playing. Then the graph

representing the given situation is as shown in Figure 1.23:

P Q

Figure 1.23

We observe that there is no edge between Q and S, between Q and T, between R and 5,
and between R and T. Therefore, the teams Q and S, Q and T, R and S, and R and T have no!
played with each other.

From the graph, we note that two edges are incident on each of the vertices Q, R, S, T and

four edges are incident on P. Thus, the teams Q, R, S, T have played two games each and the
team P has played four games, :
