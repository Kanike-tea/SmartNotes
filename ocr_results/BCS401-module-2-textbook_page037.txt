5.4 Multiplication of Large Integers and Strassen‘s Matrix Multiplication 191

simply multiplied. These observations yield the following recurrence relation:
A(n) =7A(n/2) + 18(n/2)? forn >1, AC) =0.

Though one can obtain a closed-form solution to this recurrence (see Problem 8
in this section’s exercises), here we simply establish the solution’s order of growth.
According to the Master Theorem, A(n) € @(n!°827), In other words, the number
of additions has the same order of growth as the number of multiplications. This
puts Strassen’s algorithm in © (n'°%2), which is a better efficiency class than @(n>)
of the brute-force method.

Since the time of Strassen’s discovery, several other algorithms for multiplying
two n xn matrices of real numbers in O(n*) time with progressively smaller
constants a have been invented. The fastest algorithm so far is that of Coopersmith
and Winograd [Co087] with its efficiency in O(n?>7). The decreasing values of
the exponents have been obtained at the expense of the increasing complexity
of these algorithms. Because of large multiplicative constants, none of them is of
practical value. However, they are interesting from a theoretical point of view. On
one hand, they get closer and closer to the best theoretical lower bound known
for matrix multiplication, which is n* multiplications, though the gap between this
bound and the best available algorithm remains unresolved. On the other hand,
matrix multiplication is known to be computationally equivalent to some other
important problems, such as solving systems of linear equations (discussed in the
next chapter).
