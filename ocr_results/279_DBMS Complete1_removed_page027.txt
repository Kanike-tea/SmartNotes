Converting Generalisation /Specification Hierarchy to Tables:

A simple rule for conversion may be to decompose all the specialized entities into table in
case they are disjoint, for example, for the figure we can create the three tables as:

Account (account_no, name, branch, balance)

Saving_Account (account-no, intrest)

Current_Account (account-no, charges)
