wc observe that G; can be got by merging the edges (a, w} and {w, b} of Gy and by
soe vertices x and y of degree 7 into G;. Therefore, Gy and Gz are : ‘SeTting
Also, Gs can be got either by inserting the vertices x and y of degree 2 in Gy or by
the vertex w of degree 2 in G2. Therefore, Gs is homeomorphic to both Gi and Gp. Z

| Example 8 | Verify that the following two graphs are homeomorphic but not isomorphic.

» Each graph can be obtained from the other by adding or removing appropriate vertices.

Therefore. they are homeomorphic. The fact that they are not isomorphic is evident if we
Z The following theorem known as the Kuratowski’s theorem is fundamental in the study of

planas graphs,

Theorem: * A necessary and sufficient condition for a graph G to be planar is that G doesn!

contain Ks or Kz as a subgraph or any subgraph homeomorphic to either of these.

The proof of the theorem is beyond the scope of this text.
