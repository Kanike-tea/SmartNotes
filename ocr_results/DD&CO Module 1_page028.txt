outputs change as shown in Table below. The output of the inverter at E changes from | to 0 after a 10ns
delay. The output of the AND gate at wl changes from 0 to 1 after a 30ns delay. The output of the OR
gate at D changes from | to 0 at t= 30ns and then changes back to | at t= 50ns.

Boolean Expressions

Boolean equations describing combinational logic are specified in Verilog with a continuous assignment
statement consisting of the keyword assign followed by a Boolean expression. To distinguish arithmetic
operators from logical operators, Verilog uses the symbols (&), (/), and (&) for AND, OR, and NOT
(complement), respectively. Thus, to describe the simple circuit of Fig with a Boolean expression, we

use the statement

assign D = (A && B)||(!C);
assign E = (!C);
HDL Example 3.4 describes a circuit that is specified with the following two Boolean expressions:

E=A+BC+B'D

F=B'C+BCD'
The equations specify how the logic values E and F are determined by the values of A, B, C, and D.
// Verilog model: Circuit with Boolean expressions
module Circuit_Boolean_CA (E, F, A, B, C, D);
output E, F;
input A, B, C, D;
assign E = A || (B && C) || ((!B) && D);
assign F = ((!B) && C) || (B && (!C) && (!D));
