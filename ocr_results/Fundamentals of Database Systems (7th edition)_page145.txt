may be overlapping; that is, the same (real-world) entity may be a member of more
than one subclass of the specialization. This case, which is the default, is displayed
by placing an o in the circle, as shown in Figure 4.5.

The second constraint on specialization is called the completeness (or totalness)
constraint, which may be total or partial. A total specialization constraint specifies
that every entity in the superclass must be a member of at least one subclass
in the specialization. For example, if every EMPLOYEE must be either an
HOURLY_EMPLOYEE or a SALARIED_EMPLOYEE, then the specialization
{HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE} in Figure 4.1 is a total specialization
of EMPLOYEE. This is shown in EER diagrams by using a double line to connect
the superclass to the circle. A single line is used to display a partial specialization,
which allows an entity not to belong to any of the subclasses. For example, if some
EMPLOYEE entities do not belong to any of the subclasses (SECRETARY, ENGINEER,
TECHNICIAN} in Figures 4.1 and 4.4, then that specialization is partial.”

Notice that the disjointness and completeness constraints are independent. Hence,
we have the following four possible constraints on a specialization:

= Disjoint, total

= Disjoint, partial

= Overlapping, total

= Overlapping, partial
Of course, the correct constraint is determined from the real-world meaning that
applies to each specialization. In general, a superclass that was identified through

the generalization process usually is total, because the superclass is derived from the
subclasses and hence contains only the entities that are in the subclasses.

Certain insertion and deletion rules apply to specialization (and generalization) as a
consequence of the constraints specified earlier. Some of these rules are as follows:

= Deleting an entity from a superclass implies that it is automatically deleted
from all the subclasses to which it belongs.

“The notation of using single or double lines is similar to that for partial or total participation of an entity
type in a relationship type, as described in Chapter 3.
