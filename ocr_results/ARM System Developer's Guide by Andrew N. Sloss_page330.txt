CHAPTER

EXCEPTION AND
INTERRUPT
HANDLING

At the heart of an embedded system lie the exception handlers. They are responsible for
handling errors, interrupts, and other events generated by the external system. Efficient
handlers can dramatically improve system performance. The process of determining a
good handling method can be complicated, challenging, and fun.

In this chapter we will cover the theory and practice of handling exceptions, and specif-
ically the handling of interrupts on the ARM processor. The ARM processor has seven
exceptions that can halt the normal sequential execution of instructions: Data Abort,
Fast Interrupt Request, Interrupt Request, Prefetch Abort, Software Interrupt, Reset, and
Undefined Instruction.

This chapter is divided into three main sections:

= Exception handling. Exception handling covers the specific details of how the ARM
processor handles exceptions.

= Interrupts. ARM defines an interruptas a special type of exception. This section discusses
the use of interrupt requests, as well as introducing some of the common terms, features,
and mechanisms surrounding interrupt handling.

=) Interrupt handling schemes. The final section provides a set of interrupt handling
methods. Included with each method is an example implementation.
