Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

2.7 Summary

In this chapter we introduced the main concepts used in database systems. We
defined a data model and we distinguished three main categories:

= High-level or conceptual data models (based on entities and relationships)
= Low-level or physical data models

= Representational or implementation data models (record-based, object-
oriented)

We distinguished the schema, or description of a database, from the database itself.
The schema does not change very often, whereas the database state changes every
time data is inserted, deleted, or modified. Then we described the three-schema
DBMS architecture, which allows three schema levels:

= An internal schema describes the physical storage structure of the database.
= A conceptual schema is a high-level description of the whole database.
= External schemas describe the views of different user groups.

A DBMS that cleanly separates the three levels must have mappings among
the schemas to transform requests and query results from one level to the
next. Most DBMSs do not separate the three levels completely. We used the
three-schema architecture to define the concepts of logical and physical data
independence.

Then we discussed the main types of languages and interfaces that DBMSs support.
A data definition language (DDL) is used to define the database conceptual schema.
In most DBMSs, the DDL also defines user views and, sometimes, storage struc-
tures; in other DBMSs, separate languages or functions exist for specifying storage
structures. This distinction is fading away in today’s relational implementations,
with SQL serving as a catchall language to perform multiple roles, including view
definition. The storage definition part (SDL) was included in SQL’s early versions,
but is now typically implemented as special commands for the DBA in relational
DBMSs. The DBMS compiles all schema definitions and stores their descriptions in
the DBMS catalog.

A data manipulation language (DML) is used for specifying database retrievals and
updates. DMLs can be high level (set-oriented, nonprocedural) or low level (record-
oriented, procedural). A high-level DML can be embedded in a host programming
language, or it can be used as a standalone language; in the latter case it is often
called a query language.

We discussed different types of interfaces provided by DBMSs and the types of
DBMS users with which each interface is associated. Then we discussed the
database system environment, typical DBMS software modules, and DBMS
utilities for helping users and the DBA staff perform their tasks. We continued
with an overview of the two-tier and three-tier architectures for database
applications.
