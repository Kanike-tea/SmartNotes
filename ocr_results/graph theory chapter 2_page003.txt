Prove that the complete bipartite graph K3,3 (the Kuratowski’s second 8raph) iy

up of two bipartites V; and V2 each containing three vertices such that every vertex in V, ig
joined to every vertex in V2 by an edge and vice-versa.

Let us name the vertices in V; as v1, v2, v3 and the vertices in V2 as v4, v5, v6. Also, let
the edges be named as e), €2, €3,...,e9. A diagram of the graph with the vertices and edges
so named is shown in Figure 2.6. In this diagram, the six edges e; = {v1, v4}, €4 = {v4,vy},
es = {v2,vs}, eg = {v5.3}, e9 = {v3, v6} and e3 = {v6,v1} form a hexagonal cycle and the
remaining three edges €2, es, e7 either intersect these edges or intersect among themselves a

Let us Hy to draw a diagram of K33 in which no two of its edges intersect. Let us stat

es.

Consider the edge eg : (v2, v6}. This edge can be drawn either inside the hexagonal a
or outside it. Let us draw it inside (as shown in Figure 2.7(b)) — the other case is similar. Ne
consider the edge e2 = (v,,vs}. If we draw this edge inside the hexagonal cycle, it int
the edge eg. Therefore, let us draw it outside: see Figure 2.7(b),

Next, consider the edge €7 = {v3,v4}. If this edge is drawn inside the hexagonal cy
intersects the edge 6, and if it is drawn outside, it intersects the edge e2.
