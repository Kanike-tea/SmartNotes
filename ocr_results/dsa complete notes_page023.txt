Analysis of Fast Transpose

e The first two for loops compute the values for rowTerms, the third for loop carries out the
computation of startingPos, and the last for loop places the triples into the transpose matrix.
These four loops determine the computing time of fastTranspose.

e The bodies of the loops are executed numCols, numTerms, numCols - 1, and numTerms times,
respectively. The computing time for the algorithm is O(columns + elements).

e However, transpose requires less space than fastTranspose since the latter function must
allocate space for the rowTerms and startingPos arrays.

Strings: A string is an array of characters that is delimited by the null character (\0).

Examplel: Char s[100] = {“class”} ;
The string is internally represented as follows

© L A S Ss \o
S(O) | SU | S(2]_ | Si3}_ | SI41_| SIS]

The same can also be declared as char s[]={“class”} ;

Using this declaration the compiler would have reserved just enough space to hold each character
word including the null character. In such cases we cannot store a string of length more than 5 in s

ADT string is Objects : a finite set of zero or more characters

Functions : for all s,t € string.i,j,m € non negative integers

String Null(m) ::= Return a string whose length is m characters long, but is initially set to
NULL. We write NULL as “”
Integer compare(s, t)::= | If s equals t return 0

Else if s precedes t return -1
Else return +1

Boolean ISNull(s) ::= If (compare(s, NULL)) return FALSE
Else return TRUE
Integer Length(s) ::= If(compare(s, NULL))

Returns the number of characters in s else returns 0

If(compare(t, NULL))
Return a string s whose elements are those of s followed by those of t

String concat(s,t) ::
