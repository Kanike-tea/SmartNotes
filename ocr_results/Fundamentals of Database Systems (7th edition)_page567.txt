Since DBD is implemented in Prolog, use of uppercase terms is reserved for variables
in the language and therefore lowercase constants are used to code the attributes. For
further details on using the DBD system, please refer to the laboratory manual.

Selected Bibliography

The books by Maier (1983) and Atzeni and De Antonellis (1993) include a compre-
hensive discussion of relational dependency theory. Algorithm 15.4 is based on the
normalization algorithm presented in Biskup et al. (1979). The decomposition
algorithm (Algorithm 15.5) is due to Bernstein (1976). Tsou and Fischer (1982)
give a polynomial-time algorithm for BCNF decomposition.

The theory of dependency preservation and lossless joins is given in Ullman (1988),
where proofs of some of the algorithms discussed here appear. The lossless join
property is analyzed in Aho et al. (1979). Algorithms to determine the keys of a
relation from functional dependencies are given in Osborn (1977); testing for
BCNF is discussed in Osborn (1979). Testing for 3NF is discussed in Tsou and
Fischer (1982). Algorithms for designing BCNF relations are given in Wang (1990)
and Hernandez and Chan (1991).

Multivalued dependencies and fourth normal form are defined in Zaniolo (1976)
and Nicolas (1978). Many of the advanced normal forms are due to Fagin: the fourth
normal form in Fagin (1977), PJNF in Fagin (1979), and DKNF in Fagin (1981). The
set of sound and complete rules for functional and multivalued dependencies was
given by Beeri et al. (1977). Join dependencies are discussed by Rissanen (1977) and
Aho et al. (1979). Inference rules for join dependencies are given by Sciore (1982).
Inclusion dependencies are discussed by Casanova et al. (1981) and analyzed further
in Cosmadakis et al. (1990). Their use in optimizing relational schemas is discussed
in Casanova et al. (1989). Template dependencies, which are a general form of
dependencies based on hypotheses and conclusion tuples, are discussed by Sadri and
Ullman (1982). Other dependencies are discussed in Nicolas (1978), Furtado (1978),
and Mendelzon and Maier (1979). Abiteboul et al. (1995) provides a theoretical
treatment of many of the ideas presented in this chapter and Chapter 14.
