and Design Issues
3.7.1 Summary of Notation for ER Diagrams

Figures 3.9 through 3.13 illustrate examples of the participation of entity types in
relationship types by displaying their entity sets and relationship sets (or
extensions)—the individual entity instances in an entity set and the individual rela-
tionship instances in a relationship set. In ER diagrams the emphasis is on repre-
senting the schemas rather than the instances. This is more useful in database
design because a database schema changes rarely, whereas the contents of the entity
sets may change frequently. In addition, the schema is obviously easier to display,
because it is much smaller.

Figure 3.2 displays the COMPANY ER database schema as an ER diagram. We now
review the full ER diagram notation. Regular (strong) entity types such as
EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, and PROJECT are shown in rectangular boxes. Relation-
ship types such as WORKS_FOR, MANAGES, CONTROLS, and WORKS_ON are
shown in diamond-shaped boxes attached to the participating entity types with
straight lines. Attributes are shown in ovals, and each attribute is attached by a straight
line to its entity type or relationship type. Component attributes of a composite attri-
bute are attached to the oval representing the composite attribute, as illustrated by the
Name attribute of EMPLOYEE. Multivalued attributes are shown in double ovals, as
illustrated by the Locations attribute of DEPARTMENT. Key attributes have their names
underlined. Derived attributes are shown in dotted ovals, as illustrated by the
Number_of_employees attribute of DEPARTMENT.

Weak entity types are distinguished by being placed in double rectangles and by
having their identifying relationship placed in double diamonds, as illustrated by
the DEPENDENT entity type and the DEPENDENTS _OF identifying relationship type.
The partial key of the weak entity type is underlined with a dotted line.

In Figure 3.2 the cardinality ratio of each binary relationship type is specified
by attaching a 1, M, or N on each participating edge. The cardinality ratio
of DEPARTMENT:EMPLOYEE in MANAGES is 1:1, whereas it is 1:N for
DEPARTMENT: EMPLOYEE in WORKS_FOR, and M:N for WORKS_ON. The partici-
pation constraint is specified by a single line for partial participation and by double
lines for total participation (existence dependency).

In Figure 3.2 we show the role names for the SUPERVISION relationship type
because the same EMPLOYEE entity type plays two distinct roles in that relation-
ship. Notice that the cardinality ratio is 1:N from supervisor to supervisee because
each employee in the role of supervisee has at most one direct supervisor, whereas
an employee in the role of supervisor can supervise zero or more employees.

Figure 3.14 summarizes the conventions for ER diagrams. It is important to note
that there are many other alternative diagrammatic notations (see Section 3.7.4 and
Appendix A).
