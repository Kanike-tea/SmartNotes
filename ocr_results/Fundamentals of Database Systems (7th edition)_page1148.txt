(1993) popularized the term online analytical processing (OLAP) and defined a set of
characteristics for data warehouses to support OLAP. Kimball (1996) is known for
his contribution to the development of the data warehousing field. Mattison (1996)
is one of the several books on data warehousing that gives a comprehensive analysis
of techniques available in data warehouses and the strategies companies should use
in deploying them. Ponniah (2010) gives a very good practical overview of the data
warehouse building process from requirements collection to deployment mainte-
nance. Jukic et al. (2013) is a good source on modeling a data warehouse. Bischoff
and Alexander (1997) is a compilation of advice from experts. Chaudhuri and Dayal
(1997) give an excellent tutorial on the topic, while Widom (1995) points to a num-
ber of ongoing issues and research.
