Microcontrollers-BCS402

Using AMBA, peripheral designers can reuse the same design on multiple projects. Because
there are a large number of peripherals developed with an AMBA interface, hardware

designers have a wide choice of tested and proven peripherals for use in a device.

A peripheral can simply be bolted onto the on-chip bus without having to redesign an
interface for each different processor architecture. This plug-and-play interface for hardware

developers improves availability and time to market.

AHB provides higher data throughput than ASB because it is based on a centralized
multiplexed bus scheme rather than the ASB bidirectional bus design. This change allows the
AHB bus to run at higher clock speeds and to be the first ARM bus to support widths of 64
and 128 bits.

ARM has introduced two variations on the AHB bus: Multi-layer AHB and AHB-Lite. In
contrast to the original AHB, which allows a single bus master to be active on the bus at any
time, the Multi-layer AHB bus allows multiple active bus masters. AHB-Lite is a subset of
the AHB bus and it is limited to a single bus master. This bus was developed for designs that

do not require the full features of the standard AHB bus.

AHB and Multi-layer AHB support the same protocol for master and slave but have different
interconnects. The new interconnects in Multi-layer AHB are good for systems with multiple

processors. They permit operations to occur in parallel and allow for higher throughput rates.

The example device shown in Figure 4.1 has three buses: an AHB bus for the high-
performance peripherals, an APB bus for the slower peripherals, and a third bus for external
peripherals, proprietary to this device. This external bus requires a specialized bridge to

connect with the AHB bus.

4.3 Memory

An embedded system has to have some form of memory to store and execute code. There is a
need to compare price, performance, and power consumption when deciding upon specific
memory characteristics, such as hierarchy, width, and type. If memory has to run twice as fast

to maintain a desired bandwidth, then the memory power requirement may be higher.
