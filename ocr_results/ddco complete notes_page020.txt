> Removing the bubbles on the gates of (b) produces the circuit of (a). Therefore,

the two diagrams implement the same function and are equivalent.

FIGURE 3

Three ways to implement F = AB + CD

> In Fig. 3.18(c), the output NAND gate is redrawn with the AND-invert graphic

symbol. In drawing NAND logic diagrams, the circuit shown in either Fig. 3.18(b)
or (c) is acceptable.

> The one in Fig. 3.18(b) is in mixed notation and represents a more direct

relationship to the Boolean expression it implements. The NAND implementation
in Fig. 3.18(c) can be verified algebraically.

> The function it implements can easily be converted to sum-of- products form by

DeMorgan’s theorem:

F = ((AB)'(CD)')' = AB + CD

Implement the following Boolean function with NAND gates:

F (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)

> The first step is to simplify the function into sum-of-products form. This is done
by means of the map of Fig. 3.19(a), from which the simplified function is
obtained:

F=xy't+xy+z

> The two-level NAND implementation is shown in Fig. 3.19(b) in mixed notation.
Note that input z must have a one-input NAND gate (an inverter) to compensate
for the bubble in the second-level gate. An alternative way of drawing the logic
diagram is given in Fig. 3.19(c).

> Here, all the NAND gates are drawn with the same graphic symbol. The inverter
with input z has been removed, but the input variable is complemented and
denoted by z'
