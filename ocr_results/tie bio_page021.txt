generated using magnetic fields that allow the controlled assembly of magnetically labeled
cells, as well as thermo-responsive polymers that allow controlled cell detachment from
culture surfaces.

Although hydrogels have been the dominant muscle-engineering scaffold in vitro, in vivo
studies of muscle repair have mainly utilized acellular natural scaffolds, porous matrices
made of degradable polymeric materials, or scaffold-free myoblast sheets.

14. Discuss briefly (i) Bionic eye (ii) Cataract.
Answer:
Bionic eye:

The bionic vision system consists of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses, which transmits
high- frequency radio signals to a microchip implanted in the retina. Electrodes on the
implanted chip convert these signals into electrical impulses to stimulate cells in the retina
that connect to the optic nerve. It is an expensive treatment and not everyone can afford it. b.
Since research is still going on results are yet not 100% successful.

e It’s an artificial eye which provide visual sensations to the brain. It consist of
electronic systems having image sensors, microprocessors, receivers, radio
transmitters and retinal chips. Technology provided by this help the blind people to
get vision again.

e It consist of a computer chip which is kept in the back of effected person eye and
linked with a mini video camera built into glasses that they wear. Then an image
captured by the camera are focused to the chip which converts it into electronic signal
that brain can interpret. The images produced by Bionic eye were not be too much
perfect but they could be clear enough to recognize. The implant bypasses the
diseased cells in the retina and go through the remaining possible cells.

e The device consists of 3,500 micro photodiodes which are set at the back part of the
retina. The electrical signal which is sent to brain is obtained from these miniature
solar cells array as they convert the normal light to electrical signal.

Cataract:

e A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. At first, the cloudiness
in your vision caused by a cataract may affect only a small part of the eye's lens and
you may be unaware of any vision loss. As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of
your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more-
noticeable symptoms. A cataract is a cloudy lens. The lens is positioned behind the
colored part of your eye (iris). The lens focuses light that passes into your eye,
producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye
that functions like the film in a camera.
