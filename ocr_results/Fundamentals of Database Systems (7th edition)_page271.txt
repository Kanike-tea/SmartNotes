8.1 Unary Relational Operations: SELECT and PROJECT

Chapters 6 and 7 are based on the tuple relational calculus. The relational calculus
is a formal language, based on the branch of mathematical logic called predicate
calculus. In tuple relational calculus, variables range over tuples, whereas in
domain relational calculus, variables range over the domains (values) of attributes.
In Appendix C we give an overview of the Query-By-Example (QBE) language,
which is a graphical user-friendly relational language based on domain relational
calculus. Section 8.8 summarizes the chapter.

For the reader who is interested in a less detailed introduction to formal relational
languages, Sections 8.4, 8.6, and 8.7 may be skipped.

8.1 Unary Relational Operations:
SELECT and PROJECT

8.1.1 The SELECT Operation

The SELECT operation is used to choose a subset of the tuples from a relation that
satisfies a selection condition.’ We can consider the SELECT operation to be a filter
that keeps only those tuples that satisfy a qualifying condition. Alternatively, we can
consider the SELECT operation to restrict the tuples in a relation to only those tuples
that satisfy the condition. The SELECT operation can also be visualized as a horizon-
tal partition of the relation into two sets of tuples—those tuples that satisfy the con-
dition and are selected, and those tuples that do not satisfy the condition and are
filtered out. For example, to select the EMPLOYEE tuples whose department is 4, or
those whose salary is greater than $30,000, we can individually specify each of these
two conditions with a SELECT operation as follows:

Opno=4(EMPLOYEE)
Gsalary>30000(EMPLOYEE)

In general, the SELECT operation is denoted by

G <selection condition>(R)

where the symbol (sigma) is used to denote the SELECT operator and the selec-
tion condition is a Boolean expression (condition) specified on the attributes of
relation R. Notice that R is generally a relational algebra expression whose result is a
relation—the simplest such expression is just the name of a database relation. The
relation resulting from the SELECT operation has the same attributes as R.

The Boolean expression specified in <selection condition> is made up of a number
of clauses of the form

<attribute name> <comparison op> <constant value>

2in this chapter no familiarity with first-order predicate calculus—which deals with quantified variables
and values—is assumed

The SELECT operation is different from the SELECT clause of SQL. The SELECT operation chooses
tuples from a table, and is sometimes called a RESTRICT or FILTER operation.
