Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Modul

Self-Referential Structures: A self-referential structure is one in which one or more of its
data member is a pointer to itself. They require dynamic memory allocation (malloc and free)
to explicitlyobtain and release memory.

Example:
typedef struct list {
int data;
list *link ;
ms

e Each instance of the structure list will have two components, data and link. data is a single
character, while link is a pointer to a list structure.
e The value of link is either the address in memory of an instance of list or the null pointer.

Consider these statements, which create three structures and assign values to their respective fields:
list item1, item2, item3;

item1.data = 5

item2.data= 10

item3.data = 15

item] link = item2.link = item3.link = NULL;

We can attach these structures together by replacing the null link field in item 2 with one that points
to item 3 and by replacing the null link field in item 1 with one that points to item 2.
item1 link = &item2; item2.link = &item3;

Unions: A union is a user-defined data type that can store related information that may be of
different data types or same data type, but the fields of a union must share their memory
space. This means that only one field of the union is "active" at any given time.

Example1: Suppose a program uses either a number that is int or float we can define a union as

Union num
t :
int a;
float b;
Bb

Union num nl;
Now we can store values as nl.a=5 or n2.b= 3.14 only one member is active at a point of time.

Pointer variables, Declaration and Definition
© Pointer variable is a variable that stores the address of another variable.
e Declaring Pointer variables
A variable can be declared as a pointer variable by using an indirection operator(*)
Syntax: type * identifier; _// type signifies the type of the pointer variable
For example
char *p;
int *m;
//The variable p is declared as a pointer variable of type character. The variable m is declared as a
pointer variable of type integer.

Initialization of pointer variables: Uninitialized variables have unknown garbage values stored in
them, similarly uninitialized pointer variables will have uninitialized memory address stored inside
them which may be interpreted as a memory location, and may lead to runtime error.
