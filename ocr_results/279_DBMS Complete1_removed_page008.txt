LECTURE-4: Elements of DBMS

Elements of DBMS:

DML Pre-Compiler:

It converts DML statements embedded in an application program to normal procedure calls in the
host language. The pre-complier must interact with the query processor in order to generate the

appropriate code.

DDL Compiler:

The DDL compiler converts the data definition statements into a set of tables. These tables contains

information concerning the database and are in a form
dbms.

File Manager:
File manager manages the allocation of space on

represent information stored on disk.

Database Manager:

A database manager is a program module which provides the interface between the low level data

stored in the database and the application programs an

The responsibilities of database manager are:

queries submitted to the system.

Interaction with File Manager: The data is stored on the disk using the file system which
is provided by operating system. The database manager translate the different DML
statements into low-level file system commands so the database manager is responsible for
the actual storing, retrieving and updating of data in the database.

Integrity Enforcement: The data values stored in the database must satisfy certain
constraints (eg: the age of a person can't be less then zero). These constraints are specified
by DBA. Data manager checks the constraints and if it satisfies then it stores the data in the
database.

Security Enforcement: Data manager checks the security measures for database from
unauthorized users.

Backup and Recovery: Database manager detects the failures occur due to different
causes (like disk failure, power failure, deadlock, software error) and restores the database
to original state of the database.

Concurrency Control: When several users access the same database file simultaneously,
there may be possibilities of data inconsistency. It is responsible of database manager to
control the problems occur for concurrent transactions.

Query Processor:

The query processor used to interpret to online user’s query and convert it into an efficient series of

operations in a form capable of being sent to the data

manager for execution. The query processor
