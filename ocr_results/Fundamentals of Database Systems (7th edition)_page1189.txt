Review Questions

presented in Section 30.2, is generally referred to as discretionary access control
(DAC). We presented some SQL commands for granting and revoking privileges,
and we illustrated their use with examples. Then in Section 30.3 we gave an over-
view of mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms that enforce multilevel
security. These require the classifications of users and data values into security
classes and enforce the rules that prohibit flow of information from higher to
lower security levels. Some of the key concepts underlying the multilevel rela-
tional model, including filtering and polyinstantiation, were presented. Role-
based access control (RBAC) was introduced in Section 30.3.2, which assigns
privileges based on roles that users play. We introduced the notion of role hierar-
chies, mutual exclusion of roles, and row- and label-based security. We explained
the main ideas behind the threat of SQL injection in Section 30.4, the methods in
which it can be induced, and the various types of risks associated with it. Then we
gave an idea of the various ways SQL injection can be prevented.

We briefly discussed in Section 30.5 the problem of controlling access to statistical
databases to protect the privacy of individual information while concurrently pro-
viding statistical access to populations of records. The issues related to flow control
and the problems associated with covert channels were discussed next in Sec-
tion 30.6, as well as encryption and public-versus-private key-based infrastructures
in Section 30.7. The idea of symmetric key algorithms and the use of the popular
asymmetric key-based public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme was explained in
Section 30.7.3. We also covered in Sections 30.7.4 and 30.7.5 the concepts of digital
signatures and digital certificates. We highlighted in Section 30.8 the importance of
privacy issues and hinted at some privacy preservation techniques. We discussed in
Section 30.9 a variety of challenges to security, including data quality, intellectual
property rights, and data survivability. We ended the chapter in Section 30.10 by
introducing the implementation of security policies by using a combination of
label-based security and virtual private databases in Oracle 11g.
