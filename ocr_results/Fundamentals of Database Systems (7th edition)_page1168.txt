1138 Chapter 30 Database Security

Its basic notion is that privileges and other permissions are associated with organi-
zational roles rather than with individual users. Individual users are then assigned
to appropriate roles. Roles can be created using the CREATE ROLE and DESTROY
ROLE commands. The GRANT and REVOKE commands discussed in Section 30.2
can then be used to assign and revoke privileges from roles, as well as for individual
users when needed. For example, a company may have roles such as sales account
manager, purchasing agent, mailroom clerk, customer service manager, and so on.
Multiple individuals can be assigned to each role. Security privileges that are com-
mon to a role are granted to the role name, and any individual assigned to this role
would automatically have those privileges granted.

RBAC can be used with traditional discretionary and mandatory access controls; it
ensures that only authorized users in their specified roles are given access to certain
data or resources. Users create sessions during which they may activate a subset of
roles to which they belong. Each session can be assigned to several roles, but it maps
to one user or a single subject only. Many DBMSs have allowed the concept of roles,
where privileges can be assigned to roles.

Separation of duties is another important requirement in various mainstream
DBMSs. It is needed to prevent one user from doing work that requires the involve-
ment of two or more people, thus preventing collusion. One method in which sepa-
ration of duties can be successfully implemented is with mutual exclusion of roles.
Two roles are said to be mutually exclusive if both the roles cannot be used simul-
taneously by the user. Mutual exclusion of roles can be categorized into two types,
namely authorization time exclusion (static) and runtime exclusion (dynamic). In
authorization time exclusion, two roles that have been specified as mutually exclu-
sive cannot be part of a user’s authorization at the same time. In runtime exclusion,
both these roles can be authorized to one user but cannot be activated by the user at
the same time. Another variation in mutual exclusion of roles is that of complete
and partial exclusion.

The role hierarchy in RBAC is a natural way to organize roles to reflect the organi-
zation’s lines of authority and responsibility. By convention, junior roles at the bot-
tom are connected to progressively senior roles as one moves up the hierarchy. The
hierarchic diagrams are partial orders, so they are reflexive, transitive, and antisym-
metric. In other words, if a user has one role, the user automatically has roles lower
in the hierarchy. Defining a role hierarchy involves choosing the type of hierarchy
and the roles, and then implementing the hierarchy by granting roles to other roles.
Role hierarchy can be implemented in the following manner:

GRANT ROLE full_time TO employee_type1
GRANT ROLE intern TO employee_type2

The above are examples of granting the roles full_time and intern to two types of
employees.

Another issue related to security is identity management. Identity refers to a unique
name of an individual person. Since the legal names of persons are not necessarily
unique, the identity of a person must include sufficient additional information to
