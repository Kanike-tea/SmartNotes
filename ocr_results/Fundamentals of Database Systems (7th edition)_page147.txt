The requirements for the part of the UNIVERSITY database shown in Figure 4.7
are the following:

1. The database keeps track of three types of persons: employees, alumni, and
students. A person can belong to one, two, or all three of these types. Each
person has a name, SSN, sex, address, and birth date.

2. Every employee has a salary, and there are three types of employees: fac-
ulty, staff, and student assistants. Each employee belongs to exactly one
of these types. For each alumnus, a record of the degree or degrees that
he or she earned at the university is kept, including the name of the
degree, the year granted, and the major department. Each student has a
major department.

3. Each faculty has a rank, whereas each staff member has a staff position. Stu-
dent assistants are classified further as either research assistants or teaching
assistants, and the percent of time that they work is recorded in the database.
Research assistants have their research project stored, whereas teaching
assistants have the current course they work on.
