the more available space for specialized peripherals. This in turn reduces the cost of the

design and manufacturing since fewer discrete chips are required for the end product.

ARM has incorporated hardware debug technology within the processor so that software
engineers can view what is happening while the processor is executing code. With greater
visibility, software engineers can resolve an issue faster, which have a direct effect on the

time to market and reduces overall development costs.

The ARM core is not a pure RISC architecture because of the constraints of its primary

application—the embedded system.
Instruction Set for Embedded Systems

The ARM instruction set differs from the pure RISC definition in several ways that make the

ARM instruction set suitable for embedded applications:

Variable cycle execution for certain instructions— Not every ARM instruction executes in a
single cycle. For example, load-store-multiple instructions vary in the number of execution

cycles depending upon the number of registers being transferred.

Inline barrel shifter leading to more complex instructions— The inline barrel shifter is a
hardware component that preprocesses one of the input registers before it is used by an

instruction. This improves core performance and code density.

Thumb 16-bit instruction set-—ARM enhanced the processor core by adding a second 16-bit
instruction set called Thumb that permits the ARM core to execute either 16- or 32-bit
instructions. The 16-bit instructions improve code density by about 30% over 32-bit fixed-

length instructions.

Conditional execution— An instruction is only executed when a specific condition has been
satisfied. This feature improves performance and code density by reducing branch

instructions.

Enhanced instructions— The enhanced digital signal processor (DSP) instructions were

added to the standard ARM instruction set to support fast 16 16-Bit multiplier operations.
