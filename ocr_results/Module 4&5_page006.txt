Microcontrollers - BCS402

A Prefetch Abort exception occurs when an attempt to fetch an instruction results in a memory
fault. This exception is raised when the instruction is in the execute stage of the pipeline and if
none of the higher exceptions have been raised. On entry to the handler, IRQ exceptions will be
disabled, but the FIQ exceptions will remain unchanged.If FIQ is enabled and an FIQ exception

occurs, it can be taken while servicing the Prefetch Abort.

A Software Interrupt (SWI) exception occurs when the SWI instruction is executed and none of
the other higher-priority exceptions have been flagged. On entry to the handler, the cpsr will be

set to supervisor mode.

If the system uses nested SWI calls, the link register rl14 and spsr must be stored away before

branching to the nested SWI to avoid possible corruption of the link register and the spsr.

An Undefined Instruction exception occurs when an instruction not in the ARM or Thumb
instruction set reaches the execute stage of the pipeline and none of the other exceptions have
been flagged. The ARM processor “asks” the coprocessors if they can handle this as a
coprocessor instruction. Since coprocessors follow the pipeline, instruction identification can
take place in the execute stage of the core. If none of the coprocessors claims the instruction, an

Undefined Instruction exception is raised.

Both the SWI instruction and Undefined Instruction have the same level of priority, since they
cannot occur at the same time (in other words, the instruction being executed cannot both be an

SWI instruction and an undefined instruction).
1.4 Link Register Offsets

When an exception occurs, the link register is set to a specific address based on the current pc.
For instance, when an IRQ exception is raised, the link register Ir points to the last executed
instruction plus 8. Care has to be taken to make sure the exception handler does not corrupt Ir
because Ir is used to return from an exception handler. The IRQ exception is taken only after the
current instruction is executed, so the return address has to point to the next instruction, or Ir —4.

Table 4 provides a list of useful addresses for the different exceptions.
