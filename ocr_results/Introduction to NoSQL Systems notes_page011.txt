Column-oriented databases are ideal for the following:

Real-Time Analytics: Monitor and analyze data in real time (e.g., user activity, loT
metrics).

Time-Series Data: Store sensor readings, logs, financial ticks, etc.
Recommendation Engines: Analyze large amounts of user behavior data.

Social Media Platforms: Handle high volumes of user-generated data with dynamic
attributes.

Data Warehousing: Serve as a backend for analytical platforms requiring fast access
to specific fields.

6. Cassandra Example — Data Modeling

Cassandra stores data in a denormalized format. Here's an example of a user orders table:

sql

CopyEdit

CREATE TABLE user_orders (

user_id UUID,

order_id UUID,

order_date timestamp,

product_name text,

PRIMARY KEY (user_id, order_date)

iB

This schema enables partitioning by user_id and ordering by order_date, which is highly
efficient for time-based queries.

Query Example:

sql

CopyEdit

SELECT * FROM user_orders WHERE user_id = '1234' ORDER BY order_date DESC;
