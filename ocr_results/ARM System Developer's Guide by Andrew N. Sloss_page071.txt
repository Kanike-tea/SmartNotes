EXAMPLE

3.12

The number of cycles taken to execute a multiply instruction depends on the processor
implementation. For some implementations the cycle timing also depends on the value
in Rs. For more details on cycle timings, see Appendix D.

This example shows a simple multiply instruction that multiplies registers rl and r2 together
and places the result into register r0. In this example, register r/ is equal to the value 2, and
r2 is equal to 2. The result, 4, is then placed into register r0.

PRE r0 = 0x00000000
rl = 0x00000002
r2 = 0x00000002

MUL 10, rl, r2 3 0 = rl*r2

POST rO = 0x00000004
rl = 0x00000002
r2 = 0x00000002

The long multiply instructions (SMLAL, SMULL, UMLAL, and UMULL) produce a 64-bit
result. The result is too large to fit a single 32-bit register so the result is placed in two
registers labeled RdLo and RdHi. RdLo holds the lower 32 bits of the 64-bit result, and
RdHi holds the higher 32 bits of the 64-bit result. Example 3.12 shows an example of a long
unsigned multiply instruction.

The instruction multiplies registers r2 and r3 and places the result into register r0 and rl.
Register r0 contains the lower 32 bits, and register rl contains the higher 32 bits of the
64-bit result.

PRE r0 = 0x00000000
rl = 0x00000000
r2 = 0xf0000002
r3 = 0x00000002

UMULL 0, rl, r2, 73 [rl,r0] = r2*r3

POST rO = Oxe0000004 ; = RdLo
rl = 0x00000001 ; = RdHi

3.2 BRANCH INSTRUCTIONS

A branch instruction changes the flow of execution or is used to call a routine. This type
of instruction allows programs to have subroutines, if-then-else structures, and loops.
