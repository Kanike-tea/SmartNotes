Memory remapping.

Figure 1.5 shows memory before and after reorganization. It is common for ARM-based
embedded systems to provide for memory remapping because it allows the system to start
the initialization code from ROM at power-up. The initialization code then redefines or
remaps the memory map to place RAM at address 0x00000000—an important step because
then the exception vector table can be in RAM and thus can be reprogrammed. We will
discuss the vector table in more detail in Section 2.4.

1.4.2. OPERATING SYSTEM

The initialization process prepares the hardware for an operating system to take
control. An operating system organizes the system resources: the peripherals, memory,
and processing time. With an operating system controlling these resources, they can be
efficiently used by different applications running within the operating system environment.

ARM processors support over 50 operating systems. We can divide operating systems
into two main categories: real-time operating systems (RTOSs) and platform operating
systems.

RTOSs provide guaranteed response times to events. Different operating systems have
different amounts of control over the system response time. A hard real-time application
requires a guaranteed response to work at all. In contrast, a soft real-time application
requiresa good response time, but the performance degrades more gracefully if the response
time overruns. Systems running an RTOS generally do not have secondary storage.

Platform operating systems require a memory management unit to manage large, non-
real-time applications and tend to have secondary storage. The Linux operating system is
a typical example of a platform operating system.
