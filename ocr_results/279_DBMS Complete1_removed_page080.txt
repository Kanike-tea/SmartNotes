Definition: an FD is a relationship between an attribute "Y" and a determinant (1 or more other
attributes) "X" such that for a given value of a determinant the value of the attribute is uniquely
defined.

X is a determinant

X determines Y

Y is functionally dependent on X
xX—-Y

X >Y is trivial if Y SX

Definition: An FD X — Yis satisfied in an instance r of R if for every pair of tuples, t and s: if t
and s agree on all attributes in X then they must agree on all attributes in Y

Akey constraint is a special kind of functional dependency: all attributes of relation occur on the
right-hand side of the FD:

« SSN — SSN, Name, Address
Example Functional Dependencies

Let R be
NewStudent(stuld, lastName, major, credits, status, socSecNo)

FDs in R include

e {stuld}— {lastName}, but not the reverse

{stuld} —{lastName, major, credits, status, socSecNo, stuld}

e {socSecNo} —{stuld, lastName, major, credits, status, socSecNo}
{credits}— {status}, but not {status}— {credits}

ZipCode—AddressCity
e 16652 is Huntingdon’s ZIP
ArtistName—Birth Year
¢ Picasso was born in 1881
Autobrand— Manufacturer, Engine type
¢ Pontiac is built by General Motors with gasoline engine
Author, Title>PublDate
e Shakespeare’s Hamlet was published in 1600
Trivial Functional Dependency
The FD XY is trivial if set {Y} is a subset of set {X}

Examples: If A and B are attributes of R,
