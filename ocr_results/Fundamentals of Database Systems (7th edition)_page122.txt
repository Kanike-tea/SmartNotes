participation arc (both M and N symbols stand for many or any number).’> Let us

illustrate this constraint using the SUPPLY relationship in Figure 3.17.

Recall that the relationship set of SUPPLY is a set of relationship instances (s, j, p),
where s is a SUPPLIER, j is a PROJECT, and p is a PART. Suppose that the constraint
exists that for a particular project-part combination, only one supplier will be used
(only one supplier supplies a particular part to a particular project). In this case, we
place 1 on the SUPPLIER participation, and M, N on the PROJECT, PART participa-
tions in Figure 3.17. This specifies the constraint that a particular (j, p) combination
can appear at most once in the relationship set because each such (PROJECT, PART)
combination uniquely determines a single supplier. Hence, any relationship
instance (s, j, p) is uniquely identified in the relationship set by its (j, p) combina-
tion, which makes (j, p) a key for the relationship set. In this notation, the participa-
tions that have a 1 specified on them are not required to be part of the identifying
key for the relationship set.'° If all three cardinalities are M or N, then the key will
be the combination of all three participants.

The second notation is based on the (min, max) notation displayed in Figure 3.15
for binary relationships. A (min, max) on a participation here specifies that each
entity is related to at least min and at most max relationship instances in the rela-
tionship set. These constraints have no bearing on determining the key of an n-ary
relationship, where n > 2,'” but specify a different type of constraint that places
restrictions on how many relationship instances each entity can participate in.

3.10 Another Example: A UNIVERSITY Database

We now present another example, a UNIVERSITY database, to illustrate the ER
modeling concepts. Suppose that a database is needed to keep track of student
enrollments in classes and students’ final grades. After analyzing the miniworld
rules and the users’ needs, the requirements for this database were determined to be
as follows (for brevity, we show the chosen entity type names and attribute names
for the conceptual schema in parentheses as we describe the requirements; relation-
ship type names are only shown in the ER schema diagram):

= The university is organized into colleges (COLLEGE), and each college has a
unique name (CName), a main office (COffice) and phone (CPhone), and a
particular faculty member who is dean of the college. Each college adminis-
ters a number of academic departments (DEPT). Each department has a
unique name (DName), a unique code number (DCode), a main office
(DOffice) and phone (DPhone), and a particular faculty member who chairs
the department. We keep track of the start date (CStartDate) when that fac-
ulty member began chairing the department.

'5This notation allows us to determine the key of the relationship relation, as we discuss in Chapter 9.
'8This is also true for cardinality ratios of binary relationships.

"The (min, max) constraints can determine the keys for binary relationships.
