Set Operations
¢ union, intersect and except operations are set operations available in SQL.
¢ Relations participating in any of the set operation must be compatible; i.e. they must have
the same set of attributes.
¢ Union Operation:
o Find all customers having a loan, an account, or both at the bank
(select customer-name from Depositor )
union
(select customer-name from Borrower )
It will automatically eliminate duplicates.
o If we want to retain duplicates union all can be used
(select customer-name from Depositor )
union all
(select customer-name from Borrower )
e Intersect Operation
o Find all customers who have both an account and a loan at the bank
(select customer-name from Depositor )
intersect
(select customer-name from Borrower )
o If we want to retail all the duplicates
(select customer-name from Depositor )
intersect all
(select customer-name from Borrower )
e Except Opeartion
o Find all customers who have an account but no loan at the bank
(select customer-name from Depositor )
except
(select customer-name from Borrower )
o If we want to retain the duplicates:
(select customer-name from Depositor )
except all
(select customer-name from Borrower )
Aggregate Functions
e Aggregate functions are those functions which take a collection of values as input and return
a single value.
¢ SQL offers 5 built in aggregate functions-
o Average: avg
Minimum:min

Maximum:max
Total: sum
Count:count
e The input to sum and avg must be a collection of numbers but others may have collections
of non-numeric data types as input as well
e Find the average account balance at the Sadar branch
select avg(balance)
