2. Interrupt Controllers
When a peripheral or device requires attention, it raises an interrupt to the processor. An
interrupt controller provides a programmable governing policy that allows software to
determine which peripheral or device can interrupt the processor at any specific time by
setting the appropriate bits in the interrupt controller registers.
There are two types of interrupt controller available for the ARM processor:

i) The standard interrupt controller

ii) The vector interrupt controller (VIC).
The standard interrupt controller sends an interrupt signal to the processor core when an
external device requests servicing. It can be programmed to ignore or mask an individual
device or set of devices. The interrupt handler determines which device requires servicing by
reading a device bitmap register in the interrupt controller.
The VIC is more powerful than the standard interrupt controller because it prioritizes
interrupts and simplifies the determination of which device caused the interrupt. After
associating a priority and a handler address with each interrupt, the VIC only asserts an
interrupt signal to the core if the priority of a new interrupt is higher than the currently
executing interrupt handler. Depending on its type, the VIC will either call the standard
interrupt exception handler, which can load the address of the handler for the device from the

VIC, or cause the core to jump to the handler for the device directly.
5. Embedded System Software

An embedded system needs software to drive it. Figure 5.1 shows four typical software
components required to control an embedded device. Each software component in the stack
uses a higher level of abstraction to separate the code from the hardware device.

The initialization code is the first code executed on the board and is specific to a particular
target or group of targets. It sets up the minimum parts of the board before handing control

over to the operating system.
