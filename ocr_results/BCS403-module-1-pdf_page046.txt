Partial participation

we do not expect every employee to manage a department .So the participation of EMPLOYEE in the
MANAGES relationship type is partial, meaning that some or part of the set of employee entities are

related to some department entity via MANAGES, but not necessarily all.

In ER diagrams, total participation is displayed as a double line connecting the participating entity type

to the relationship, whereas partial participation is represented by a single line.
cardinality ratio + participation constraints = structural constraints of a relationship type.
3.4.4 Attributes of Relationship Types

Relationship types can also have attributes, similar to those of entity types. For example, to record the
number of hours per week that an employee works on a particular project, we can include an attribute
Hours for the WORKS _ON relationship type. Another example is to include the date on which a manager
started managing a department via an attribute Start_date for the MANAGES relationship type.

Attributes of 1:1 or 1:N relationship types can be migrated to one of the participating entity types. For a
1:N relationship type, a relationship attribute can be migrated only to the entity type on the N-side of the
relationship. For M:N relationship types, some attributes may be determined by the combination of
participating entities in a relationship instance, not by any single entity. Such attributes must be specified

as relationship attributes.

3.5 Weak Entity Types

Entity. typesithatido nof‘havekey attributes of their own are called weak entity types. Entities belonging
tA WEAK entifVltype are identified by being related to specific entities from another entity type in
CombinatiOnWithone Of Their attributelValues) We call this other entity type the identifying or owner
entity type. We call the relationship type that relates a weak entity type to its owner the identifying
relationship of the weak entity type.

Consider the entity type DEPENDENT, related to EMPLOYEE, which is used to keep track of the
dependents of each employee via a 1:N relationship. In our example, the attributes of DEPENDENT are
Name,Birth_date, gender, and Relationship (to the employee). Two dependents of two distinct employees
may, by chance, have the same values for Name, Birth_date, gender, and Relationship, but they are still

distinct entities. They are identified as distinct entities only after determining the particular employee
