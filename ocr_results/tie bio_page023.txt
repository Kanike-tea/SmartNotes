Module #4 & 5
1. Explain Echolocation with applications and write a short note on SONARs.

Answer:

Echolocation is a biological phenomenon used by certain animals, including some
species of Bats and Whales and Dolphins, to navigate and perceive their environment.

It involves emitting sound waves and then interpreting the echoes that bounce back
after the sound waves encounter objects in their surroundings.

The process begins with the animal emitting high-frequency sound pulses, which are
usually ultrasonic and beyond the range of human hearing.

These sound waves travel through the air or water and interact with nearby objects.
When the sound waves hit an object, they bounce back as echoes towards the animal.

The animal's specialized sensory organs, such as the ears or the lower jaw are highly
sensitive to these returning echoes.

By analyzing the echo, the animal can determine the object's size, shape, distance, and
even its texture.

It allows them to hunt for prey, avoid obstacles, and navigate complex surroundings
effectively.

Applications:

Ultrasound refers to sound above the human audible limit of 20 kHz.

Ultrasound of frequencies up to 10 MHz and beyond is used in medical diagnosis,
therapy, and surgery.

When the pulse encounters a boundary between organs or between two tissue regions
of different densities, reflections of sound occur.

By scanning the body with Ultrasound and detecting echoes generated by various
organs, a sonogram of the internal structure(s) can be generated.

Sonography: Diagnostic ultrasound, also called sonography or diagnostic medical
sonography, is an imaging method that uses sound waves to produce images of
structures within your body.

The images can provide valuable information for diagnosing and directing treatment
for a variety of diseases and conditions.
