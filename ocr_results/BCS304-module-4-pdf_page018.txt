Adjacency matrices for G,, Gy, and Gy

Adjacency Lists:
For any given list, i, the nodes in the list contain the vertices that are adjacent from vertex i.
Figure 6.8 shows the adjacency lists for G;, G3, and G4.

Sdefine MAX-VERTICES 50_/*maximum number of Yertices* /
typedef struct node *fhode-pointer;
typedef struct nod@ {

int vertex?

struct node ¢Vink;

}:
node-pointer graph (MAXSVERTICES);
int n = 0; /* vertices ¢urrenbly gn use */

G declarations for the adjacency list representation

sequential representation for the graph G4 of Figure 6.5. We can determine the degree of any
vertex in an undirected graph by simply counting the number of nodes in its adjacency list.
This also gives us the number of edges incident on the vertex.
