BASIC OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS

An Instruction consists of 2 parts, 1) Operation code (Opcode) and 2) Operands.

OPCODE OPERANDS

e The data/operands are stored in memory.
e The individual instruction are brought from the memory to the processor.
e Then, the processor performs the specified operation.
Let us see a typical instruction
ADD LOCA, RO
This instruction is an addition operation. The following are the steps to execute the instruction:
Step 1: Fetch the instruction from main-memory into the processor.
Step 2: Fetch the operand at location LOCA from main-memory into the processor.
Step 3: Add the memory operand (fetched contents of LOCA) to the contents of register RO.
Step 4: Store the result (sum) in RO.
The same instruction can be realized using 2 instructions as:
Load LOCA, RI
Add R1, RO
The following are the steps to execute the instruction:
Step 1: Fetch the instruction from main-memory into the processor.
Step 2: Fetch the operand at location LOCA from main-memory into the register R1.
Step 3: Add the content of Register R1 and the contents of register RO.

Step 4: Store the result (sum) in RO.

MAIN PARTS OF PROCESSOR

e The processor contains ALU, control-circuitry and many registers.
e The processor contains “n” general-purpose registers RO through Rn-1.
e = The IR holds the instruction that is currently being executed.
e The control-unit generates the timing-signals that determine when a given action is to take place.
e The PC contains the memory-address of the next-instruction to be fetched & executed.
e During the execution of an instruction, the contents of PC are updated to point to next instruction.
e¢ The MAR holds the address of the memory-location to be accessed.
¢ The MDR contains the data to be written into or read out of the addressed location.
e MAR and MDR facilitates the communication with memory.
(IR- Instruction-Register, PC- Program Counter, MAR-Memory Address Register, MDR-Memory
Data Register)
