Relation schema

A relation schema R, denoted by R(Ai, Ao, ....An), is made up of a relation name R anda list
of attributes Ai, Ao, ...,An. Each attribute Aj is the name of a role played by some domain D in
the relation schema R. D is called the domain of Ai and is denoted by dom(Ai). A relation
schema is used to describe a relation; R is called the name of this relation.

The degree (or arity) of a relation is the number of attributes n of its relation schema. A relation
of degree seven, which stores information about university students,would contain seven
attributes describing each student. as follows:
STUDENT(Name, Ssn, Home_phone, Address, Office_phone, Age, Gpa)
Using the data type of each attribute, the definition is sometimes written as:
STUDENT(Name: string, Ssn: string, Home_phone: string, Address: string,
Office. phone: string, Age: integer, Gpa: real)
Domains for some of the attributes of the STUDENT relation:
dom(Name) = Names; dom(Ssn) = Social_security_numbers;

dom(HomePhone)=USA_phone_numbers,dom(Office_phone)= USA_phone_numbers,

Relation (or relation state)

A relation (or relation state) r of the relation schema by R(A1, Ag, ...,An), also denoted by r(R),
is a set of n-tuples r = {ti, to, ..., tm}. Each n-tuple t is an ordered list of n values t =<vi, vo, ...,
n>, where each value vi, | <i<<n, is an element of dom (Ai) or is a special NULL value. The i'*
value in tuple t, which corresponds to the attribute Ai, is referred to as t[Ai] or t. Ai
The terms relation intension for the schema R and relation extension for a relation state r(R)

are also commonly used.
