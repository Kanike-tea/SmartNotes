17.3 Dynamic Multilevel Indexes Using B-Trees and B*-Trees

17.3 Dynamic Multilevel Indexes Using
B-Trees and B*-Trees

B-trees and B*-trees are special cases of the well-known search data structure
known as a tree. We briefly introduce the terminology used in discussing tree data
structures. A tree is formed of nodes. Each node in the tree, except for a special
node called the root, has one parent node and zero or more child nodes. The root
node has no parent. A node that does not have any child nodes is called a leaf node;
a nonleaf node is called an internal node. The level of a node is always one more
than the level of its parent, with the level of the root node being zero.’ A subtree of
anode consists of that node and all its descendant nodes—its child nodes, the child
nodes of its child nodes, and so on. A precise recursive definition of a subtree is that
it consists of a node n and the subtrees of all the child nodes of n. Figure 17.7 illus-
trates a tree data structure. In this figure the root node is A, and its child nodes are
B, C, and D. Nodes E, J, C, G, H, and K are leaf nodes. Since the leaf nodes are at
different levels of the tree, this tree is called unbalanced.

In Section 17.3.1, we introduce search trees and then discuss B-trees, which can be
used as dynamic multilevel indexes to guide the search for records in a data file.
B-tree nodes are kept between 50 and 100 percent full, and pointers to the data
blocks are stored in both internal nodes and leaf nodes of the B-tree structure. In
Section 17.3.2 we discuss B*-trees, a variation of B-trees in which pointers to the
data blocks of a file are stored only in leaf nodes, which can lead to fewer levels and

This standard definition of the level of a tree node, which we use throughout Section 173, is different
from the one we gave for multilevel indexes in Section 17.2.
