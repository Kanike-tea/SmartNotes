Bipartite graph

Suppose a simple graph G is such that its vertex set V is the union of two of its mutually
disjoint nonempty subsets V; and V2 which are such that each edge in G joins a vertex in V, and
a vertex in V2. Then G is called a bipartite graph. If E is the edge set of this graph, the graph
is denoted by G = (Vi, V2; E), or G = G(V}, V2; E). The sets V; and V2 are called bipartites (or
partitions) of the vertex set V.

For example, consider the graph G shown in Figure 1.20 for which the vertex set is V =
{A, B,C, P,Q,R,S} and the edge set is E = {AP,AQ, AR, BR, CQ, CS}. Note that the set V is
the union of two of its subsets V, = {A, B,C} and V2 = {P, Q,R,S} which are such that (i) V;
and V2 are disjoint, (ii) every edge in G joins a vertex in V; and a vertex in V>, (iii) G contains
no edge that joins two vertices both of which are in V; or V2. This graph is a bipartic graph
with V, = {A, B, C} and V2 = {P, Q, R, S} as bipartites.

Complete Bipartite graph

A bipartite graph G = (Vi, V2; E) is called a complete bipartite graph if there is a0 pe
een every vertex in V; and every vertex in V2.

The bipartite graph shown in Figure 1.20 is nor
example, that the graph does not contain an edge joi

a complete bipartite graph. Observe: ff
