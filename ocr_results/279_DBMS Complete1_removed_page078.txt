RELATIONAL DATABASE DEGIN

Database design is a process in which you create a logical data model for a database, which store
data of a company. It is performed after initial database study phase in the database life cycle. You
use normalization technique to create the logical data model for a database and eliminate data
redundancy.

Normalization also allows you to organize data efficiently in a database and reduce anomalies
during data operation. Various normal forms, such as first, second and third can be applied to create
a logical data model for a database. The second and third normal forms are based on partial
dependency and transitivity dependency. Partial dependency occurs when a row of table is uniquely
identified by one column that is a part of a primary key. A transitivity dependency occurs when a
non key column is uniquely identified by values in another non-key column of a table.

Database Design Process:
We can identify six main phases of the database design process:

1. Requirement collection and analysis
Conceptual database design

Choice of a DBMS

Data model mapping(logical database design)
Physical database design

Database system implementation and tuning

1. Requirement Collection and Analysis
Before we can effectively design a data base we must know and analyze the expectation of
the users and the intended uses of the database in as much as detail.

2. Conceptual Database Design
The goal for this phase is to produce a conceptual schema for the database that is
independent of a specific DBMS.
> We often use a high level data model such ER-model during this phase
> We specify as many of known database application on transactions as possible using a
notation that is independent of any specific dbms.
> Often the dbms choice is already made for the organization the intent of conceptual
design still to keep , it as free as possible from implementation consideration.

3. Choice of a DBMS
The choice of dbms is governed by a no. of factors some technical other economic and still
other concerned with the politics of the organization.
The economics and organizational factors that offer the choice of the dbms are:
Software cost, maintenance cost, hardware cost, database creation and conversion cost,
personnel cost, training cost, operating cost.

4. Data model mapping (logical database design)
During this phase, we map the conceptual schema from the high level data model used on
