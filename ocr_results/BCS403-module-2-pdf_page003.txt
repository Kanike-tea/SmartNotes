1.1.2 Characteristics of Relations

1. Ordering of Tuples in a Relation

A relation is defined as a set of tuples. Mathematically, elements of a set have no order
among them; hence, tuples in a relation do not have any particular order. Tuple ordering is
not part of a relation definition because a relation attempts to represent facts at a logical or
abstract level. Many tuple orders can be specified on the same relation.

2. Ordering of Values within a Tuple and an Alternative Definition of a Relation
The order of attributes and their values is not that important as long as the correspondence
between attributes and values is maintained. An alternative definition of a relation can be
given, making the ordering of values in a tuple unnecessary. In this definition Ajrélation

attribute name appears with its value.

3. Values and NULLs in the Tuples
Each value in a tuple is atomic. NULL values are used to represent the values of attributes
that may be unknown or may not apply to a tuple. For example some STUDENT tuples have
NULL for their_office phones because they do not have an office .Another student has a
NULL for home phone In general, we can have several meanings for NULL values, such as
value unknown, value exists but is not available, or attribute does not apply to this tuple
(also known as value undefined).

4. Interpretation (Meaning) of a Relation
The relation schema can be interpreted as a declaration or a type of assertion. For example,
the schema of the STUDENT relation of asserts that, in general, a student entity has a Name,
Ssn, Home_phone, Address, Office_phone, Age, and Gpa. Each tuple in the relation can then
be interpreted as a particular instance of the assertion.For example, the first tuple asserts the
fact that there is a STUDENT whose Name is Benjamin Bayer, Ssn is 305-61-2435, Age is

19, and so on.

An alternative interpretation of a relation schema is as a predicate; in this case, the values in

each tuple are interpreted as values that satisfy the predicate.
