Two Address | Opcode Source, Destination Add A,B| Add the contents of | Move B,C
memory-locations A & B. Add A,C
Then, place the result into
location B, replacing the
original contents of this
location.

Operand B is both a source
and a destination.

One Address | Opcode Source/Destination Load A | Copy contents of memory- Load A
location A into accumulator. | Add B
Add B Add contents of memory- | Store C
location B to contents of
accumulator register &

place sum back into
accumulator.

Store C | Copy the contents of the
accumulator into location C.

Zero Opcode [no Push Locations of all operands Not possible
Address Source/Destination] are defined implicitly.
The operands are stored in
a pushdown stack.

Access to data in the registers is much faster than to data stored in memory-locations.
Let Ri represent a general |-purpose register. The instructions:
Load ARi
Store Ri,A
Add ARi
are generalizations of the Load, Store and Add Instructions for the single-accumulator case, in which
register Ri performs the function of the accumulator.
In processors, where arithmetic operations as allowed only on operands that are in registers, the task
C<-[A]+[B] can be performed by the instruction sequence:
Move A.Ri
Move B,Rj
Move Rj.c

INSTRUCTION EXECUTION & STRAIGHT LINE SEQUENCING
+ The program is executed as follows:
1) Initially, the address of the first instruction is loaded into PC (Figure 2.8).
2) Then, the processor control circuits use the information in the PC to fetch and execute a
instructions, one at a time, in the order of increasing addresses. This is called Straight-Line

sequencing. ota

3) During the execution of each instruction, PC is incremented by 4 to point to next instruction.
* There are 2 phases for Instruction Execution:
1) Fetch Phase: The instruction is fetched from the memory-location and placed in the IR.

2) Execute Phase: The contents of IR is examined to determine which operation is to be ot

performed. The specified-operation is then performed by the processor.
