1.6 Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach

have the capability to control this redundancy in order to prohibit inconsisten-
cies among the files. This may be done by automatically checking that the
Student_name-Student_number values in any GRADE_REPORT record in Fig-
ure 1.6(a) match one of the Name-Student_number values of a STUDENT record (Fig-
ure 1.2). Similarly, the Section_identifie--Course_number values in GRADE_REPORT
can be checked against SECTION records. Such checks can be specified to the DBMS
during database design and automatically enforced by the DBMS whenever the
GRADE_REPORT file is updated. Figure 1.6(b) shows a GRADE_REPORT record that
is inconsistent with the STUDENT file in Figure 1.2; this kind of error may be entered
if the redundancy is not controlled. Can you tell which part is inconsistent?

1.6.2 Restricting Unauthorized Access

When multiple users share a large database, it is likely that most users will not be
authorized to access all information in the database. For example, financial data
such as salaries and bonuses is often considered confidential, and only autho-
rized persons are allowed to access such data. In addition, some users may only
be permitted to retrieve data, whereas others are allowed to retrieve and update.
Hence, the type of access operation—retrieval or update—must also be con-
trolled. Typically, users or user groups are given account numbers protected by
passwords, which they can use to gain access to the database. A DBMS should
provide a security and authorization subsystem, which the DBA uses to create
accounts and to specify account restrictions. Then, the DBMS should enforce
these restrictions automatically. Notice that we can apply similar controls to the
DBMS software. For example, only the DBA’s staff may be allowed to use certain
privileged software, such as the software for creating new accounts. Similarly,
parametric users may be allowed to access the database only through the pre-
defined apps or canned transactions developed for their use. We discuss data-
base security and authorization in Chapter 30.

1.6.3 Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects

Databases can be used to provide persistent storage for program objects and data
structures. This is one of the main reasons for object-oriented database systems
(see Chapter 12). Programming languages typically have complex data structures,
such as structs or class definitions in C++ or Java. The values of program variables
or objects are discarded once a program terminates, unless the programmer explic-
itly stores them in permanent files, which often involves converting these complex
structures into a format suitable for file storage. When the need arises to read this
data once more, the programmer must convert from the file format to the program
variable or object structure. Object-oriented database systems are compatible with
programming languages such as C++ and Java, and the DBMS software auto-
matically performs any necessary conversions. Hence, a complex object in C++
can be stored permanently in an object-oriented DBMS. Such an object is said to
be persistent, since it survives the termination of program execution and can
later be directly retrieved by another program.
