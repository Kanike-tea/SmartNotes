Now (1) + (2) gives,
(lti)atb+id=0. bee # + (4)
Let us solve (3) and (4) by writing them in the form | ;
Qa © +1b-1d=0 + (3).
(1l+i)a+1b+ id=0 -- (4)

Applying the rule of cross multiplication we have,

a -b d

a=1,b=-1,d=-1 ;
Alsofrom(1) .c=-a - c=-1..

Substituting = values of a, b, c, d the assumed bilinear transforination becomes

w=

rT a

1-
Thus w= oro is the required bilinear transformation.

Further, the invariant points are obtained by taking w =z

ie., z= or z+ 221-2"
1+z

ie, ee a
- _=2 2.

Thus the invariant points are -1 +12 2 and, -1-12: -
Note : If the equations are simple we can finda, b, c,d with
cross multiplication and the same is illustrated as follows.

Using c=~-a and d= b in(2) wehave indnagsteas,
or a(1+i) =-b(1+i) >a sb

So’ we have a=-b,c=b,

Faia b Choosing b=1 for convenience we have
a=-1,c=1, del,
