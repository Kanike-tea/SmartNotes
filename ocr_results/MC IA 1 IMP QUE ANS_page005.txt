Cache Memory: A block of fast memory placed between the main memory and the core to improve
memory access performanceS9 . It allows the processor to access frequently used data and
instructions faster, reducing the need to wait for slower external memory59 . Most ARM-based
systems use a single-level cache internal to the processor59 .

In Von Neumann architectures, a unified cache stores both data and instructions59 ....

In Harvard architectures, there are separate caches for data and instructions60 . While cache
increases general performance, it can lead to less predictable execution time, which is a concern for
real-time systems58 ....

Tightly Coupled Memory (TCM): For real-time systems requiring deterministic code execution,
where the timing of instruction and data access must be predictable, TCM is used60 .... TCM is fast
SRAM located very close to the core, guaranteeing the number of clock cycles for fetches61 . TCM
appears as fast memory in the address map61 .

Harvard Technology with Cache and TCMs: Figure 12 (not provided, but described) illustrates a
Harvard architecture that combines both caches and TCMs61 .... This approach allows for both
improved performance through caching and predictable real-time response through TCM62 . The

processor can use the cache for general-purpose memory access and TCM for critical real-time code
and data that require guaranteed timing.

Complete Instruction Set

The ARMV5E instruction set architecture (ISA) includes various categories of instructions63 ...:

Data Processing Instructions: Manipulate data within registers. These include Move (MOV)65 ,
Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, RSB)66 ..., Logical (AND, ORR, BIC)68 ..., Comparison (CMP, TST, TEQ)70 ...,
and Multiply (MUL, MLA, UMULL, UMLAL, SMULL, SMLAL)72 ... instructions. Many of these can use
the barrel shifter for preprocessing one of the operands64 ....

Load-Store Instructions: Transfer data between memory and processor registers. These include
Single-Register Transfer (LDR, STR) for words, half-words, and bytes with various addressing modes
(pre-indexed, post-indexed)76 ..., Multiple Register Transfer (LDM, STM) for transferring sets of
registers81 ..., and the Swap (SWP) instruction for atomically swapping register content with
memory content83 ....
