Binary Adder- Subtractor

+ Acombinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits is called a half adder .

The addition of three bits (two significant bits and a previous carry) is a full adder.

A binary adder-subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs the arithmetic
operations of addition and subtraction with binary numbers.

The half adder design is carried out first, from which we develop the full adder.

Connecting n full adders in cascade produces a binary adder for two n -bit numbers.

Half Adder

Half Adder circuit needs two binary inputs and two binary outputs.

output variables produce the sum and carry. We assign symbols x and y to the two
inputs and S (for sum) and C (for carry) to the outputs.

The C output is 1 only when both inputs are 1. The S output represents the least
significant bit of the sum.

The truth table for the half adder is listed in Table 4.3 .
