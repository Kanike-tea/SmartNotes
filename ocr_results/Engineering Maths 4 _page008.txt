‘Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations of First
Order and First Degree

We have studied various analytical ( theoretical’) methods of solving differential
equations, applicable only to equations in some specific form. But the differential
equations arising out of many physical problems do not belong to a specific form and
some times analytical solution may not even exist. Insome cases it may be very difficult

’ to solve by analytical methods. In such cases Numerical Methods assumes importance
and computers help in many numerical methods for obtaining the result to the highest
degree of accuracy.

Numerical methods for initial value problems

Consider a differential equation of first order and first degree in the form

ra = f(x,y) with the initial condition y(xy) = yp, thatis y = Yo at x =X.

* This problem of finding y iscalled an initial value problem. .

We discuss several numerical methods for solving an initial value problem.

, Taylor's series method

: : a
Consider the initial value problem : = = f(x,y) and y(x) = yy

The solution y(x) is approximated to a power series iri (x — xy) using Taylor's
series. Then we can find the value of y for variousvvalues of x in theneighbouthood
Of Xq % ,

We have Taylor's series expansion of y(2.) about the point x, in the form:
