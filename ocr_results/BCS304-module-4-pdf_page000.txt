4.1 BINARY SEARCH TREES:

Definition: A binary search tree is a binary tree. It may be empty. If it is not empty, it satisfies
the following properties:

(1) Every element has a key, and no two elements have the same key, that is, the keys are
unique.

(2) The keys in a nonempty left subtree must be smaller than the key in the root of the subtree.

(3) The keys in a nonempty right subtree must be larger than the key in the root of the subtree.
(4) The left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.

4.1.1 Searching A Binary Search Tree

Suppose we wish to search for an element with a key. We begin at the root. If the root is NULL,
the search tree contains no elements and the search is unsuccessful. Otherwise, we compare
key with the key value in root. If key equals root's key value, then the search terminates
successfully. If key is less than roofs key value, then no element in the right subtree can have

a key value equal to key. Therefore, we search the left subtree of root. If key is larger than roofs
key value, we search the right subtree of root.

tree-pointer search(tree-pointer root, int key)
{
/* return a pointer to the node that contains key. If
there is no such node, return NULL. */

if (!root) return NULL;

if (key == root->data) return root;

if (key < root->data)

return search(root->left-child, key);

return search (root—>right—child, key);
