Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases

3. The lifetime of an object specifies whether it is a persistent object (that is, a
database object) or transient object (that is, an object in an executing pro-
gram that disappears after the program terminates). Lifetimes are indepen-
dent of classes/types—that is, some objects of a particular class may be
transient whereas others may be persistent.

4. The structure of an object specifies how the object is constructed by using
the type constructors. The structure specifies whether an object is atomic or
not. An atomic object refers to a single object that follows a user-defined
type, such as Employee or Department. If an object is not atomic, then it will be
composed of other objects. For example, a collection object is not an atomic
object, since its state will be a collection of other objects.*! The term atomic
object is different from how we defined the atom constructor in Sec-
tion 12.1.3, which referred to all values of built-in data types. In the OOMG
model, an atomic object is any individual user-defined object. All values of
the basic built-in data types are considered to be literals.

5. Object creation refers to the manner in which an object can be created. This

is typically accomplished via an operation new for a special Object_Factory
interface. We shall describe this in more detail later in this section.

In the object model, a literal is a value that does not have an object identifier. How-
ever, the value may have a simple or complex structure. There are three types of
literals: atomic, structured, and collection.

1. Atomic literals” correspond to the values of basic data types and are pre-
defined. The basic data types of the object model include long, short, and
unsigned integer numbers (these are specified by the keywords long, short,
unsigned long, and unsigned short in ODL), regular and double precision
floating-point numbers (float, double), Boolean values (boolean), single
characters (char), character strings (string), and enumeration types (enum),
among others.

2. Structured literals correspond roughly to values that are constructed using
the tuple constructor described in Section 12.1.3. The built-in structured lit-
erals include Date, Interval, Time, and Timestamp (see Figure 12.5(b)). Addi-
tional user-defined structured literals can be defined as needed by each
application.”* User-defined structures are created using the STRUCT key-
word in ODL, as in the C and C++ programming languages.

21In the ODMG model, atomic objects do not correspond to objects whose values are basic data types.

All basic values (integers, reals, and so on) are considered literals.

?2The use of the word atomic in atomic literal corresponds to the way we used atom constructor in
Section 12.1.3.

28The structures for Date, Interval, Time, and Timestamp can be used to create either literal values or
objects with identifiers.
