concerns, watermarking techniques for relational data have been proposed. The
main purpose of digital watermarking is to protect content from unauthorized
duplication and distribution by enabling provable ownership of the content. Digital
watermarking has traditionally relied upon the availability of a large noise domain
within which the object can be altered while retaining its essential properties. How-
ever, research is needed to assess the robustness of such techniques and to investi-
gate different approaches aimed at preventing intellectual property rights violations.

30.9.3 Database Survivability

Database systems need to operate and continue their functions, even with reduced
capabilities, despite disruptive events such as information warfare attacks. A DBMS,
in addition to making every effort to prevent an attack and detecting one in the
event of occurrence, should be able to do the following:

= Confinement. Take immediate action to eliminate the attacker’s access to
the system and to isolate or contain the problem to prevent further spread.

= Damage assessment. Determine the extent of the problem, including failed
functions and corrupted data.

= Reconfiguration. Reconfigure to allow operation to continue in a degraded
mode while recovery proceeds.

= Repair. Recover corrupted or lost data and repair or reinstall failed system
functions to reestablish a normal level of operation.

= Fault treatment. To the extent possible, identify the weaknesses exploited in
the attack and take steps to prevent a recurrence.

The goal of the information warfare attacker is to damage the organization’s opera-
tion and fulfillment of its mission through disruption of its information systems.
The specific target of an attack may be the system itself or its data. Although attacks
that bring the system down outright are severe and dramatic, they must also be well
timed to achieve the attacker’s goal, since attacks will receive immediate and con-
centrated attention in order to bring the system back to operational condition,
diagnose how the attack took place, and install preventive measures.

To date, issues related to database survivability have not been sufficiently investi-
gated. Much more research needs to be devoted to techniques and methodologies
that ensure database system survivability.

30.10 Oracle Label-Based Security

Restricting access to entire tables or isolating sensitive data into separate databases
is a costly operation to administer. Oracle label security overcomes the need for
such measures by enabling row-level access control. It is available starting with
Oracle Database 11g Release 1 (11.1) Enterprise Edition. Each database table or
view has a security policy associated with it. This policy executes every time the
table or view is queried or altered. Developers can readily add label-based access
