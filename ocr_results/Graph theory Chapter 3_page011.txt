> We recall that a complete, m-ary y tree Tisa rooted tree in which every internal vertex is of

out-degree m.
Since every vertex in a rooted tree’is either a leat or an internal vertex, the total number of

vertices in T (that is, the order of T) is the sum of the number of leaves in T and the number of

internal vertices in T. Thus, we have 1 wh) Uy > eae
