How does a category differ from a regular shared subclass? What is a cate-
gory used for? Illustrate your answer with examples.

For each of the following UML terms (see Sections 3.8 and 4.6), discuss the
corresponding term in the EER model, if any: object, class, association, aggre-
gation, generalization, multiplicity, attributes, discriminator, link, link attri-
bute, reflexive association, and qualified association.

Discuss the main differences between the notation for EER schema dia-
grams and UML class diagrams by comparing how common concepts are
represented in each.

List the various data abstraction concepts and the corresponding modeling
concepts in the EER model.

What aggregation feature is missing from the EER model? How can the EER
model be further enhanced to support it?

What are the main similarities and differences between conceptual database
modeling techniques and knowledge representation techniques?

Discuss the similarities and differences between an ontology and a database
schema.

Design an EER schema for a database application that you are interested in.
Specify all constraints that should hold on the database. Make sure that the
schema has at least five entity types, four relationship types, a weak entity
type, a superclass/subclass relationship, a category, and an n-ary (n > 2) rela-
tionship type.

Consider the BANK ER schema in Figure 3.21, and suppose that it
is necessary to keep track of different types of ACCOUNTS
(SAVINGS_ACCTS, CHECKING_ACCTS, ... ) and LOANS (CAR_LOANS,
HOME_LOANS, ... ). Suppose that it is also desirable to keep track of
each ACCOUNT’s TRANSACTIONS (deposits, withdrawals, checks, ... )
and each LOAN’s PAYMENTS; both of these include the amount, date,
and time. Modify the BANK schema, using ER and EER concepts of
specialization and generalization. State any assumptions you make
about the additional requirements.

The following narrative describes a simplified version of the organization of
Olympic facilities planned for the summer Olympics. Draw an EER diagram
that shows the entity types, attributes, relationships, and specializations for
this application. State any assumptions you make. The Olympic facilities are
divided into sports complexes. Sports complexes are divided into one-sport
and multisport types. Multisport complexes have areas of the complex desig-
nated for each sport with a location indicator (e.g., center, NE corner, and so
