Database Management System [BCS403]

= The lock_item and unlock_item operations must be implemented as indivisible units that
is, no interleaving should be allowed once a lock or unlock operation is started until the
operation terminates or the transaction waits
= The wait command within the lock_item(X) operation is usually implemented by putting
the transaction in a waiting queue for item X until X is unlocked and the transaction can
be granted access to it
= Other transactions that also want to access X are placed in the same queue.Hence, the
wait command is considered to be outside the lock_item operation.
= It is quite simple to implement a binary lock; all that is needed is a binary-valued
variable, LOCK, associated with each data item X in the database
= In its simplest form, each lock can be a record with three fields: <Data_item_name,
LOCK, Locking_transaction> plus a queue for transactions that are waiting to access the
item
= If the simple binary locking scheme described here is used, every transaction must obey
the following rules:
1. A transaction T must issue the operation lock_item(X) before any
read_item(X) or write_item(X) operations are performed in T.
2. A transaction 7 must issue the operation unlock_item(X) after all
read_item(X) and write_item(X) operations are completed in T.
3. A transaction. T will not issue a lock_item(X) operation if it already holds the lock
on item X.
4. A transaction T will not issue an unlock_item(X) operation unless it already holds

the lock on item. x.

2. Shared/Exclusive (or Read/Write) Locks

= binary locking scheme is too restrictive for database items because at most, one
transaction can hold a lock on a given item

= should allow several transactions to access the same item X if they all access X for
reading purposes only

= if a transaction is to write an item X, it must have exclusive access to X

= For this purpose, a different type of lock called a multiple-mode lock is used

= In this scheme—called shared/exclusive or read/write locks—there are three locking

operations: read_lock(X), write_lock(X), and unlock(X).
