Binary Trees
The Abstract Data type

Definition: A binary tree is a finite set of nodes that is either empty or consists of a root and two
disjoint binary trees called the left subtree and the right subtree.

Objects: a finite set of nodes either empty or consisting of a root node, left Binary_Tree, and right
Binary_Tree.

Functions: for all bt,bt1,bt2 € BinTree, item € element

BinTree Create() ::= creates an empty binary tree

Boolean IsEmpty(bt) ::= if (bt == empty binary tree)
return TRUE else return FALSE

BinTree MakeBT(bt1, item,bt2) return a binary tree whose left

n= subtree is bt], whose right

subtree is bt2, and whose root

node contains the data item.

if (IsEmpty(bt)) return error else
return the left subtree of bt.
Element Data(bt) ::= if (IsEmpty(bt)) return error else
return the data in the root node ofbt.
if (IsEmpty(bt)) return error else
return the right subtree of bt

BinTree Lchild(bt) ::

BinTree Rchild(bt) ::

Difference between binary tree and tree.

Binary tree Tree
Empty tree exist No tree exist with zero nodes
Order of the child is considered Order of the child is not considered
Each node can be partitioned to only two Each node can be partitioned to T1,T2.....Tn
disjoint subtrees disjoint subtrees

Properties of Binary Tree
Lemma |: [Maximum number of nodes]

1. The maximum number of nodes on level i of a binary tree is 2 i>.
Proof:
The proof is by induction on i.

Induction Base: The root is the only node on level i = 1. Hence, the maximum number of
nodes
on level i= 1 is2*!=2°=1.

Induction Hypothesis: Let i be an arbitrary positive integer greater than 1. Assume that the
maximum number of nodes on level i - 1 is 2'?.

Induction Step:
The maximum number of nodes on level i - | is 2‘? by the induction hypothesis
