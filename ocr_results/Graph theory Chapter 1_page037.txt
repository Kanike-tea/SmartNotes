a 1. Directed Graphs and Graph

We observe that both of these two graphs have the same number of vertices but differen
number of edges. Therefore, although there can exist one-to-one correspondence between the _
vertices, there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between the edges. The two graphs re
therefore not isomorphic. :

From the definition of isomorphism of graphs, it follows that if two graphs are isomorphic, -
then they must have:

1. The same number of vertices
2, The same number of edges

3. An equal number of vertices with a given degree

These conditions are necessary but not sufficient. This means that two graphs for whi
these conditions hold need not be isomorphic. (See Example 8 below)
In particular, two graphs of the same order and the same size need not be isomorphic i
see this, consider the two graphs shown in Figure 1. 47. 4

Figure 1.47

We note that both of these graphs are of order 4 and size 3. But the two graphs a
isomorphic. Observe that there are two pendant vertices in the first graph whereas a
three pendant vertices in the second graph. As such, under any one-to-one correspond
between the vertices and the edges of the two graphs, the adjacency of vertices is not reser
