3943, 4750, 6975, 4981, and 9208. The file uses eight buckets, numbered 0 to
7. Each bucket is one disk block and holds two records. Load these records
into the file in the given order, using the hash function h(K) = K mod 8. Cal-
culate the average number of block accesses for a random retrieval on Part#.

Load the records of Exercise 16.31 into expandable hash files based on
extendible hashing. Show the structure of the directory at each step, and the
global and local depths. Use the hash function h(K) = K mod 128.

Load the records of Exercise 16.31 into an expandable hash file, using linear
hashing. Start with a single disk block, using the hash function hy = K mod 2°,
and show how the file grows and how the hash functions change as the
records are inserted. Assume that blocks are split whenever an overflow
occurs, and show the value of at each stage.

Compare the file commands listed in Section 16.5 to those available on a file
access method you are familiar with.

Suppose that we have an unordered file of fixed-length records that uses an
unspanned record organization. Outline algorithms for insertion, deletion,
and modification of a file record. State any assumptions you make.

Suppose that we have an ordered file of fixed-length records and an unor-
dered overflow file to handle insertion. Both files use unspanned records.
Outline algorithms for insertion, deletion, and modification of a file record
and for reorganizing the file. State any assumptions you make.

Can you think of techniques other than an unordered overflow file that can
be used to make insertions in an ordered file more efficient?

Suppose that we have a hash file of fixed-length records, and suppose that
overflow is handled by chaining. Outline algorithms for insertion, deletion,
and modification of a file record. State any assumptions you make.

Can you think of techniques other than chaining to handle bucket overflow
in external hashing?

Write pseudocode for the insertion algorithms for linear hashing and for
extendible hashing.

Write program code to access individual fields of records under each of the fol-
lowing circumstances. For each case, state the assumptions you make concern-
ing pointers, separator characters, and so on. Determine the type of information
needed in the file header in order for your code to be general in each case.

a. Fixed-length records with unspanned blocking
b. Fixed-length records with spanned blocking

c. Variable-length records with variable-length fields and spanned blocking
d. Variable-length records with repeating groups and spanned blocking

e. Variable-length records with optional fields and spanned blocking

f. Variable-length records that allow all three cases in parts c, d, and e
