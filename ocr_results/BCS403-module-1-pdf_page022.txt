Database Management System [BCS403]

View Definition Language (VDL),
View definition language is used to specify user views and their mappings to the
conceptual schema. In relational DBMSs, SQL is used in the role of VDL to define user or

application views as results of predefined queries.

Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Data manipulation languages (DML) are used to perform manipulation operation such as
retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification of the data. There are two main types of DMLs :
1. High-level or nonprocedural DML : can be used on its own to specify complex database
operations concisely. Many DBMSs allow high-level DML statements either to be entered
interactively from a display monitor or terminal or to be embedded ina general-purpose
programming language. In the latter case, DML statements must be identified within the
program so that they can be extracted by a precompiler and processed by the DBMS.
High-level DMLs, such as SQL, can specify and retrieve many records in a single DML
statement; therefore, they are called set-at-a-time or set-oriented DMLs. A query in a
high-level DML often specifies: which data to retrieve rather than how to retrieve it;
therefore, such languages are also called declarative
2. Low-level or procedural DML: must be.embedded in a general-purpose programming
language. This type of DML typically retrieves individual records or objects from the
database and processes each separately. language constructs, such as looping, to retrieve
and process each record from a set of records. Low-level DMLs are also called record-at-
a-time DMLs because of this property. DL/1, a DML designed for the hierarchical model,
is a low-level DML that uses commands such as GET UNIQUE, GET NEXT, or GET
NEXT WITHIN PARENT to navigate from record to record within a hierarchy of records

in the database.

Host language

Whenever DML commands, whether high level or low level, are embedded in a general-
purpose programming language, that language is called the host language and the DML is
called the data sublanguage.

A high-level DML used in a standalone interactive manner is called a query language.

DBMS Interfaces
User-friendly interfaces provided by a DBMS may include the following:
