Sequential Logic

» Sequential logic refers to a type of digital logic circuit that uses
memory elements to store information.

> It consists of a combinational circuit to which storage elements are
connected to form a feedback path. The storage elements are devices
capable of storing binary information.

> asequential circuit is specified by a time sequence of inputs, outputs,
and internal states.
