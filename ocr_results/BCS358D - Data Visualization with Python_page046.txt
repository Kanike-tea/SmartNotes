similarity calculations. The ratio() method used in the example calculates a similarity ratio

ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no similarity and 1.0 indicates an exact match.

PROGRAM
import difflib
def string_similarity(strl, str2):
result = difflib.SequenceMatcher (a=strl.lower(), b=str2.lower())
return result.ratio()
strl = 'Python Exercises’
str2 = 'Python Exercises

or strl = input("Enter a sentence: ")
' or str2 = input("Enter a sentence: ")
print ("Original string:")

print (str1l)

print (str2)

print ("Similarity between two said strings:")

print (string _similarity(str1,str2))

strl = 'Python Exercises’ or strl = input("Enter a sentence: ")
str2 = 'Python Exercise' or str2 = input("Enter a sentence: ")
print ("\nOriginal string:")

print (str1l)

print (str2)

print ("Similarity between two said strings:")

print (string _similarity(str1,str2))

OUTPUT

Original string:

Python Exercises

Python Exercises

Similarity between two said strings:
1.0

Original string:

Python Exercises

Python Exercise

Similarity between two said strings:
0.967741935483871
