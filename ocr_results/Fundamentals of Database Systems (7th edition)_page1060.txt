27.2.1 Boolean Model

In this model, documents are represented as a set of terms. Queries are formulated
as a combination of terms using the standard Boolean logic set-theoretic operators
such as AND, OR and NOT. Retrieval and relevance are considered as binary con-
cepts in this model, so the retrieved elements are an “exact match” retrieval of rele-
vant documents. There is no notion of ranking of resulting documents. All retrieved
documents are considered equally important—a major simplification that does not
consider frequencies of document terms or their proximity to other terms com-
pared against the query terms.

Boolean retrieval models lack sophisticated ranking algorithms and are among the
earliest and simplest information retrieval models. These models make it easy to
associate metadata information and write queries that match the contents of the
documents as well as other properties of documents, such as date of creation,
author, and type of document.
