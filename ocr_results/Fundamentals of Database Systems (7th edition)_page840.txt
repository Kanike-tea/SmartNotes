Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques

21.22. Prove that strict two-phase locking guarantees strict schedules.

21.23. Prove that the wait-die and wound-wait protocols avoid deadlock and
starvation.

21.24. Prove that cautious waiting avoids deadlock.

21.25. Apply the timestamp ordering algorithm to the schedules in Figures 21.8(b)
and (c), and determine whether the algorithm will allow the execution of the
schedules.

21.26. Repeat Exercise 21.25, but use the multiversion timestamp ordering method.

21.27. Why is two-phase locking not used as a concurrency control method for
indexes such as B*-trees?

21.28. The compatibility matrix in Figure 21.8 shows that IS and IX locks are com-
patible. Explain why this is valid.

21.29. The MGL protocol states that a transaction T can unlock a node N, only if
none of the children of node N are still locked by transaction T. Show that
without this condition, the MGL protocol would be incorrect.

Selected Bibliography

The two-phase locking protocol and the concept of predicate locks were first pro-
posed by Eswaran et al. (1976). Bernstein et al. (1987), Gray and Reuter (1993), and
Papadimitriou (1986) focus on concurrency control and recovery. Kumar (1996)
focuses on performance of concurrency control methods. Locking is discussed in
Gray et al. (1975), Lien and Weinberger (1978), Kedem and Silbershatz (1980), and
Korth (1983). Deadlocks and wait-for graphs were formalized by Holt (1972), and
the wait-wound and wound-die schemes are presented in Rosenkrantz et al. (1978).
Cautious waiting is discussed in Hsu and Zhang (1992). Helal et al. (1993) com-
pares various locking approaches.

Timestamp-based concurrency control techniques are discussed in Bernstein and
Goodman (1980) and Reed (1983). Optimistic concurrency control is discussed in
Kung and Robinson (1981) and Bassiouni (1988). Papadimitriou and Kanellakis
(1979) and Bernstein and Goodman (1983) discuss multiversion techniques. Multi-
version timestamp ordering was proposed in Reed (1979, 1983), and multiversion
two-phase locking is discussed in Lai and Wilkinson (1984). A method for multiple
locking granularities was proposed in Gray et al. (1975), and the effects of locking
granularities are analyzed in Ries and Stonebraker (1977). Bhargava and Reidl
(1988) presents an approach for dynamically choosing among various concurrency
control and recovery methods. Concurrency control methods for indexes are pre-
sented in Lehman and Yao (1981) and in Shasha and Goodman (1988). A perfor-
mance study of various B*-tree concurrency control algorithms is presented in
Srinivasan and Carey (1991).
