© Theny, = ag F(x) &y = % Pa F (x) are two independent solutions of (1).

© Thus y = A y, + By, constitutes the general / complete solution of (1) in series,
where A and B are arbitrary constants.

Remark : It should be noted that the roots k, k, of the indicial equation can also be (a) real,
distinct, differing by a non zero integer, that is k, -k, = 1,2,3,... (b) coincident, that is
kK =k = ¢ (say)

The complete / general solution in the case (a) will be

y=Aly i, =k, +B ou | (A, B are arbitrary constants)
=k
1

where k, < k, andk = k, will not result in a new independent solution.

The complete / general solution in the case (b) will be

- ay
y= Atyheet3{ Se

Note: Problems on these two cases are not presented as the focus of attention is mainly on
the power series method and Frobenius method.

21. Solve by Frobenius method the equation 4x = +2 = +y=0
