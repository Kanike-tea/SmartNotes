The Process of Photosynthesis in Plants and in Some Animals

The process of photosynthesis in plants and some animals differs in terms of the type of
organisms involved and the specific details of the process. However, the basic principle of
converting light energy into usable forms of energy is the same in both.

In plants, photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of the cells located in the leaves.
The process starts with the absorption of light energy by pigments such as chlorophyll, which then
excites electrons. These excited electrons are used to power the transfer of carbon dioxide into
organic molecules, such as sugars and starches, through a series of chemical reactions. The end
product of photosynthesis in plants is stored chemical energy in the form of organic compounds.

In some animals, such as algae, photosynthesis also takes place in chloroplasts. The
process is essentially the same as in plants, with the absorption of light energy and the conversion
of carbon dioxide into organic molecules.

In contrast, some animals, such as jellyfish, have a symbiotic relationship with
photosynthetic organisms, such as algae. In this relationship, the animal provides a safe and stable
environment for the photosynthetic organism, while the photosynthetic organism provides energy
in the form of organic compounds produced through photosynthesis.

Light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin
cycle) are two interconnected processes that occur in the chloroplasts of plants and algae during
photosynthesis.
