specific fiscal quarter, and specific region. By including additional dimensions, a data
hypercube could be produced, although more than three dimensions cannot be easily
visualized or graphically presented. The data can be queried directly in any combina-
tion of dimensions, thus bypassing complex database queries. Tools exist for viewing
data according to the user’s choice of dimensions.

Changing from one-dimensional hierarchy (orientation) to another is easily accom-
plished in a data cube with a technique called pivoting (also called rotation). In this
technique, the data cube can be thought of as rotating to show a different orienta-
tion of the axes. For example, you might pivot the data cube to show regional sales
revenues as rows, the fiscal quarter revenue totals as columns, and the company’s
products in the third dimension (Figure 29.4). Hence, this technique is equivalent
to having a regional sales table for each product separately, where each table shows
quarterly sales for that product region by region. The term slice is used to refer to a
two-dimensional view of a three- or higher-dimensional cube. The Product vs.
Region 2-D view shown in Figure 29.2 is a slice of the 3-D cube shown in Figure
29.3. The popular term “slice and dice” implies a systematic reduction of a body of
data into smaller chunks or views so that the information is made visible from mul-
tiple angles or viewpoints.

Multidimensional models lend themselves readily to hierarchical views in what is
known as roll-up display and drill-down display. A roll-up display moves up the
