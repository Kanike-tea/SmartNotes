ans issue a numbered, machine-readable card with the member’s photo on it.
This card is good for four years. A month before a card expires, a notice is
sent to a member for renewal. Professors at the institute are considered auto-
matic members. When a new faculty member joins the institute, his or her
information is pulled from the employee records and a library card is mailed
to his or her campus address. Professors are allowed to check out books for
three-month intervals and have a two-week grace period. Renewal notices to
professors are sent to their campus address.

The library does not lend some books, such as reference books, rare books,
and maps. The librarians must differentiate between books that can be lent
and those that cannot be lent. In addition, the librarians have a list of some
books they are interested in acquiring but cannot obtain, such as rare or out-
of-print books and books that were lost or destroyed but have not been
replaced. The librarians must have a system that keeps track of books that
cannot be lent as well as books that they are interested in acquiring. Some
books may have the same title; therefore, the title cannot be used as a means
of identification. Every book is identified by its International Standard Book
Number (ISBN), a unique international code assigned to all books. Two
books with the same title can have different ISBNs if they are in different
languages or have different bindings (hardcover or softcover). Editions of
the same book have different ISBNs.

The proposed database system must be designed to keep track of the mem-
bers, the books, the catalog, and the borrowing activity.

Design a database to keep track of information for an art museum. Assume

that the following requirements were collected:

= The museum has a collection of ART_OBJECTS. Each ART_OBJECT has a
unique Id_no, an Artist (if known), a Year (when it was created, if known),
a Title, and a Description. The art objects are categorized in several ways, as
discussed below.

= ART_OBJECTS are categorized based on their type. There are three main
types—PAINTING, SCULPTURE, and STATUE—plus another type called
OTHER to accommodate objects that do not fall into one of the three main
types.

= A PAINTING has a Paint_type (oil, watercolor, etc.), material on which
it is Drawn_on (paper, canvas, wood, etc.), and Style (modern,
abstract, etc.).

= A SCULPTURE or a statue has a Material from which it was created (wood,
stone, etc.), Height, Weight, and Style.

= Anart object in the OTHER category has a Type (print, photo, etc.) and Style.

= ART_OBJECTs are categorized as either PERMANENT_COLLECTION
(objects that are owned by the museum) and BORROWED. Information
captured about objects in the PERMANENT_COLLECTION includes
Date_acquired, Status (on display, on loan, or stored), and Cost. Information
