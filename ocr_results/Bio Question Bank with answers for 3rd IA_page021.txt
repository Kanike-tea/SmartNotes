(b) Self-healing Bio Concrete

Self-healing bio-concrete is a type of concrete that incorporates microorganisms, such as
Bacillus fragments, into the mixture, along with calcium lactate as a nutrient source. The
microorganisms are activated when the concrete cracks, and they produce calcium
carbonate, which fills in the cracks and repairs the concrete. This process is known as
bio-mineralization.

The benefits of self-healing bio-concrete include increased durability, reduced
maintenance costs, and improved sustainability, as the concrete is able to repair itself
without the need for human intervention. Additionally, because the microorganisms used
in the concrete are naturally occurring and non-toxic, self-healing bio-concrete is
considered to be environmentally friendly.

Self-healing bio-concrete is still a relatively new technology and is currently in
the research and development phase. However, initial studies have shown promising
results and have demonstrated the potential for self-healing bio-concrete to be a viable
alternative to traditional concrete in certain applications.

Self-healing bio-concrete works by incorporating Bacillus bacteria into the

concrete mixture, along with calcium lactate as a nutrient source. The bacteria are dormant
within the concrete and do not become active until the concrete cracks.

When the concrete cracks, water and oxygen enter the crack and activate the
Bacillus bacteria. The bacteria then produce calcium carbonate, which is a type of mineral
