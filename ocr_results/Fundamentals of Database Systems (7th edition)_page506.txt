Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

relation schema in the database is, say, in BCNF or 3NF. Rather, the process of nor-
malization through decomposition must also confirm the existence of additional
properties that the relational schemas, taken together, should possess. These would

include two properties:

= The nonadditive join or lossless join property, which guarantees that the
spurious tuple generation problem discussed in Section 14.1.4 does not
occur with respect to the relation schemas created after decomposition

= The dependency preservation property, which ensures that each functional
dependency is represented in some individual relation resulting after

decomposition

The nonadditive join property is extremely critical and must be achieved at any
cost, whereas the dependency preservation property, although desirable, is some-
times sacrificed, as we discuss in Section 15.2.2. We defer the discussion of the for-
mal concepts and techniques that guarantee the above two properties to Chapter 15.

14.3.2 Practical Use of Normal Forms

Most practical design projects in commercial and governmental environment acquire
existing designs of databases from previous designs, from designs in legacy models, or
from existing files. They are certainly interested in assuring that the designs are good
quality and sustainable over long periods of time. Existing designs are evaluated by
applying the tests for normal forms, and normalization is carried out in practice so
that the resulting designs are of high quality and meet the desirable properties stated
previously. Although several higher normal forms have been defined, such as the 4NF
and 5NF that we discuss in Sections 14.6 and 14.7, the practical utility of these normal
forms becomes questionable. The reason is that the constraints on which they are
based are rare and hard for the database designers and users to understand or to
detect. Designers and users must either already know them or discover them as a part
of the business. Thus, database design as practiced in industry today pays particular

attention to normalization only up to 3NF, BCNF, or at most 4NF.

Another point worth noting is that the database designers need not normalize to the
highest possible normal form. Relations may be left in a lower normalization status,
such as 2NF, for performance reasons, such as those discussed at the end of Sec-
tion 14.1.2. Doing so incurs the corresponding penalties of dealing with the anomalies.

Definition. Denormalization is the process of storing the join of higher nor-

mal form relations as a base relation, which is in a lower normal form.

14.3.3 Definitions of Keys and Attributes Participating in Keys

Before proceeding further, let’s look again at the definitions of keys of a relation

schema from Chapter 3.

Definition. A superkey of a relation schema R = {Aj, Ap, ... , An} is a set of attri-
butes S C R with the property that no two tuples f and f in any legal relation
state r of R will have t)[S] = t[S]. A key K is a superkey with the additional property
that removal of any attribute from K will cause K not to be a superkey anymore.
