Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that result in progressive weakness
and degeneration of the skeletal muscles, which are responsible for movement. The disorders are
caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins needed for muscle function. The most
common type of muscular dystrophy is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which typically affects
young boys and leads to severe disability by early adulthood. Other forms of the disease include
Becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and  facioscapulohumeral
dystrophy, among others.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) usually appears early in childhood between the ages of 2
and 3. DMD primarily affects boys but can affect girls in rare cases. The primary symptom of
DMD is muscle weakness that begins in the muscles close to the body and later affects muscles in
the outer limbs.

Becker muscular dystrophy typically becomes apparent between the ages of 5 and 15. It
is similar to Duchenne MD, except that it progresses slower and symptoms begin to appear later.
Boys are primarily affected by Becker MD. Becker MD causes muscle loss that begins in the
hips and pelvic area, thighs, and shoulders.

The age of onset of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is highly varied, ranging from early
childhood to later adulthood. The disease is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy of the
muscles of the hip and shoulder areas (the limb girdles).

Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) typically appears before the age of 20, but can
appear later in adulthood or even in childhood in both males and females. FSHD affects the
muscles of the face, around the shoulder blades, and in the upper arms.

There is currently no cure for muscular dystrophy, but various treatments can help
manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These may include physical therapy,
assistive devices, orthopedic surgery, and medication to manage muscle spasms and pain. In
some cases, genetic therapy and stem cell transplantation are also being explored as potential
treatment options.

It's important for individuals with muscular dystrophy to work closely with a healthcare
team that includes specialists in neurology, rehabilitation medicine, and orthopedics, to develop a
comprehensive care plan that meets their specific needs.

Bioengineering solutions for muscular dystrophy

Bioengineering solutions for muscular dystrophy aim to improve the lives of individuals
affected by the disease by addressing the underlying genetic mutations and muscle weakness.
Some of the approaches being explored include:

e Gene therapy: This involves delivering a functional copy of the missing or mutated gene to
the affected muscle cells. The goal is to restore the production of the missing protein and
improve muscle function.

e Stem cell therapy: This involves using stem cells to replace the damaged muscle cells and
promote repair and regeneration of the muscle tissue. Stem cells can be taken from the
patient's own body (autologous stem cells) or from a donor (allogenic stem cells).

e Exoskeleton technology: This involves using wearable devices, such as_ robotic
exoskeletons, to support and enhance the movement of individuals with muscular dystrophy.
