S={HH,HT,TH,TT}
X = Number of ‘heads* in the outcome. © | . :
The association of the elements in S to ‘X isas follows. *
Out come “ik HH | HT TH
Random variable X | 2 | am

Range of X = {0, 1, 2}

Suppose Y = Number of ‘tails’ in the outcome.

Out come HH HT TH tT |:
Random variable X 0 | 1 | 1? 2 J ,
Range of Y = {0, 1, 2}

Example - 3 Let the random experiment be throwing a pair of ‘die’ and the sample .
space S associated with it is the set of all pairs of numbers chosen from 1 to 6.

That is, S$ = tits y)/x, y belong the set of nos. 1, 2,3, 4,5, 6|

To each outcome (x, y) of S let us associate a random variable X = x+ y

The range of X = {2, 3,4, +12} corresponding to the 36 outcomes in $
namely (1, 1), (1, 2)---(1, 6), (2, 1)-++(6, 6)

Wehave X(1,1)=2 ; X(1,2)=3=X(2,1);
X(1,3) =4=X(3,1) = X(2,-2) ete.
Discrete and Continuous random variables - Definitions

Ifa random variable takes finite or countably infinite number of values then it is called
a discrete random variable. Here countably infinite means a sequence of real’ . -:
numbers. It is evident that a discrete random variable will have finite or countably
infinite range. : :

If a random variable takes non countable infinite number of values then it is called a

non discrete or continuous random variable. Equivalently we can say that, if the
range of a random variable X is an interval of real numbers then X is a continuous
random variable. A continuous random variable can assume any value in the interval

of real numbers. .

Example -1

(a), Tossing a coin and observing the outcome.

(b) Tossing coins and observing the number of heads turning up. s
(c) Throwing a‘die’ and observing the numbers on the face. |!

These are some of the examples of a discrete random variable, ’
