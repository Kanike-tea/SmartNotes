Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

The persistent storage of program objects and data structures is an important func-
tion of database systems. Traditional database systems often suffered from the so-
called impedance mismatch problem, since the data structures provided by the
DBMS were incompatible with the programming language’s data structures.
Object-oriented database systems typically offer data structure compatibility with
one or more object-oriented programming languages.

1.6.4 Providing Storage Structures and Search
Techniques for Efficient Query Processing

Database systems must provide capabilities for efficiently executing queries and
updates. Because the database is typically stored on disk, the DBMS must provide
specialized data structures and search techniques to speed up disk search for the
desired records. Auxiliary files called indexes are often used for this purpose.
Indexes are typically based on tree data structures or hash data structures that are
suitably modified for disk search. In order to process the database records needed
by a particular query, those records must be copied from disk to main memory.
Therefore, the DBMS often has a buffering or caching module that maintains parts
of the database in main memory buffers. In general, the operating system is respon-
sible for disk-to-memory buffering. However, because data buffering is crucial to
the DBMS performance, most DBMSs do their own data buffering.

The query processing and optimization module of the DBMS is responsible for
choosing an efficient query execution plan for each query based on the existing
storage structures. The choice of which indexes to create and maintain is part of
physical database design and tuning, which is one of the responsibilities of the DBA
staff. We discuss query processing and optimization in Part 8 of the text.

1.6.5 Providing Backup and Recovery

A DBMS must provide facilities for recovering from hardware or software failures.
The backup and recovery subsystem of the DBMS is responsible for recovery. For
example, if the computer system fails in the middle of a complex update transac-
tion, the recovery subsystem is responsible for making sure that the database is
restored to the state it was in before the transaction started executing. Disk backup
is also necessary in case of a catastrophic disk failure. We discuss recovery and
backup in Chapter 22.

1.6.6 Providing Multiple User Interfaces

Because many types of users with varying levels of technical knowledge use a data-
base, a DBMS should provide a variety of user interfaces. These include apps for
mobile users, query languages for casual users, programming language interfaces
for application programmers, forms and command codes for parametric users,
and menu-driven interfaces and natural language interfaces for standalone users.
Both forms-style interfaces and menu-driven interfaces are commonly known as
