Proof: Consider a cut-set S in graph G (Fig. 4-2). Let the removal of S
partition the vertices of G into two (mutually exclusive or disjoint) subsets V,
and V;. Consider a circuit [ in G. If all the vertices in P are entirely within
vertex set V, (or V2), the number of edges common to S and I is zero; that is,

N(S()T) =0, an even number.
If, on the other hand, some vertices in are in V,and some in V>, we traverse

back and forth between the sets V, and V as we traverse the circuit (see Fig. 4-

2). Because of the closed nature of a circuit, the number of edges we traverse
between V, and V> must be even. And since very edge in S has one end in V, and

the other in V,, and no other edge in G has this property (of separating sets
V,and V>), the number of edges common to S and [ is even. =

Proof: Let the number of vertices in a given tree T is n and n>=2. Therefore the number of
edges in a tree T=n-1 using above theorems.
summation of (deg(Vi)) = 2*e

2*(n-1)
=2n-2

The degree sum is to be divided among n vertices. Since a tree T is a connected graph, it
cannot have a vertex of degree zero. Each vertex contributes at-least one to the above sum.
Thus there must be at least two vertices of degree 1. Hence every tree with at-least two
vertices have at-least two pendant vertices.
