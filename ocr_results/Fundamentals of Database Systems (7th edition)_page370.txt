Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques

presented, with examples using C as the host language. We discussed some of the
functions in the SQL/CLI library, how queries are passed as strings, how query
parameters are assigned at runtime, and how results are returned to program vari-
ables. We then gave an overview of the JDBC class library, which is used with Java,
and discussed some of its classes and operations. In particular, the ResultSet class
is used to create objects that hold the query results, which can then be iterated over
by the next () operation. The get and set functions for retrieving attribute values
and setting parameter values were also discussed.

In Section 10.4, we gave a brief overview of stored procedures, and discussed
SQL/PSM as an example of a database programming language. Finally, we briefly
compared the three approaches in Section 10.5. It is important to note that we chose
to give a comparative overview of the three main approaches to database program-
ming, since studying a particular approach in depth is a topic that is worthy of its
own textbook.

Review Questions
10.1. What is ODBC? How is it related to SQL/CLI?
10.2. What is JDBC? Is it an example of embedded SQL or of using function calls?

10.3. List the three main approaches to database programming. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

10.4. What is the impedance mismatch problem? Which of the three program-
ming approaches minimizes this problem?

10.5. Describe the concept of a cursor and how it is used in embedded SQL.

10.6. What is SQL] used for? Describe the two types of iterators available in SQLJ.

Exercises

10.7. Consider the database shown in Figure 1.2, whose schema is shown in Fig-
ure 2.1. Write a program segment to read a student’s name and print his or
her grade point average, assuming that A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, and D = 1 points.
Use embedded SQL with C as the host language.

10.8. Repeat Exercise 10.7, but use SQL] with Java as the host language.

10.9. Consider the library relational database schema in Figure 6.6. Write a pro-
gram segment that retrieves the list of books that became overdue yesterday
and that prints the book title and borrower name for each. Use embedded
SQL with C as the host language.

10.10. Repeat Exercise 10.9, but use SQL with Java as the host language.
