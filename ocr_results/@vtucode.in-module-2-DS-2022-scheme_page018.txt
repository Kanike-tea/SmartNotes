LINKED STACKS AND QUEUES

The below figure shows stacks and queues using linked list. Nodes can easily add or delete a node from the

top of the stack. Nodes can easily add a node to the rear of the queue and add or delete a node at the front

The representation of n << MAX_STACKS
#define MAX STACKS 10 /* maximum number “of stacks */
typedef struct {

int key;

/* other! fields */
element;

typedef struct stack *st@ckPointer;
typedef struct {

element data;

stackPointer
link;
} stack;
stackPointer top[MAX\STACKS] ;
The initial condition for the stacks is:
top[i] = NULL, 0 <

i < MAX_STACKS
The boundary condition is:

top [i] = NULL iff the ith stack is empty
