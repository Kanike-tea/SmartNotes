30.1 Introduction to Database Security Issues

© Account number, credit card number, or debit card number, if circum-
stances exist wherein such a number could be used without additional
identifying information, access codes, or passwords;

© Account passwords or personal identification numbers or other access codes

Because laws defining what constitutes personal information vary from state to state,
systems must protect individuals’ privacy and enforce privacy measures adequately.
Discretionary access control (see Section 30.2) alone may not suffice. Section 30.7
briefly discusses encryption techniques, including popular techniques such as public
key encryption (which is heavily used to support Web-based transactions against
databases) and digital signatures (which are used in personal communications).

A comprehensive discussion of security in computer systems and databases is outside
the scope of this text. We give only a brief overview of database security techniques
here. Network- and communication-based security is also a vast topic that we do not
cover. For a comprehensive discussion, the interested reader can refer to several of the
references discussed in the Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter.

30.1.3 Database Security and the DBA

As we discussed in Chapter 1, the database administrator (DBA) is the central
authority for managing a database system. The DBA’s responsibilities include
granting privileges to users who need to use the system and classifying users and
data in accordance with the policy of the organization. The DBA has a DBA account
in the DBMS, sometimes called a system or superuser account, which provides
powerful capabilities that are not made available to regular database accounts and
users.” DBA-privileged commands include commands for granting and revoking
privileges to individual accounts, users, or user groups and for performing the fol-
lowing types of actions:

1. Account creation. This action creates a new account and password for a
user or a group of users to enable access to the DBMS.

2. Privilege granting. This action permits the DBA to grant certain privileges
to certain accounts.

3. Privilege revocation. This action permits the DBA to revoke (cancel) cer-
tain privileges that were previously given to certain accounts.

4. Security level assignment. This action consists of assigning user accounts to
the appropriate security clearance level.

The DBA is responsible for the overall security of the database system. Action 1 in
the preceding list is used to control access to the DBMS as a whole, whereas actions
2 and 3 are used to control discretionary database authorization, and action 4 is
used to control mandatory authorization.

°This account is similar to the root or superuser accounts that are given to computer system administra-
tors and that allow access to restricted operating system commands.
