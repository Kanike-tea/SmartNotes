Pattern matching : Consider two strings str and pat where pat is a pattern to be searched for in
stri. The easiest way to find if the pat is in str is by using the built in function strstr.

Example: If we have a declaration as follows
Char pat[max_size], str[max_size], *t;

The pattern matching can be carried out as follows
if((t= strstr(str,pat))
Printf(“The pattern found in the string is %s”,t);
Else
Printf(“* The pattern was not found”);

Since there are different methods to find pattern matching discussed below are two functions that
finds pattern matching in a more efficient way.

The easiest and the least efficient method in pattern matching is sequential search. The computing
time is of O(n.m).

Exhaustive patter matching is improved in nfind function by
® Quitting when strlen(pat) is greater than the number of remaining characters

© Compare the first and last character if pat and string before we check the remaining
characters

int nfind(char *string char *pat)
{

Int ij,start=0;

int lasts=strlen(string)-1;

int lastp=strlen(pat)-1;

int endmatch= lastp

for(i=0;endmatch<=lasts;endmatch++,strt++)

{
If(string[endmatch] == pat[lastp])
{
j= start;
while(j<lastp && string[i]== pat[j])
{
i++;
j++):
i
t
if(j==lastp)
return start;
}
return -1
