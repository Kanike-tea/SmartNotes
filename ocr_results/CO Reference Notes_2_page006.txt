+ The word length can vary from 8 to 64 bits.

+ A unit of 8 bits is called a byte.
+ Accessing the memory to store or retrieve a single item of information (word/byte) requires distinct

addresses for each item location. (It is customary to use numbers from 0 through 2K.1 as the addresses of
successive-locations in the memory).
- If 2k = no. of addressable locations;
then 2K addresses constitute the address-space of the computer.
For example, a 24-bit address generates an address-space of 274 locations (16 MB).

BYTE-ADDRESSABILITY

+ In byte-addressable memory, successive addresses refer to successive byte locations in the memory.
+ Byte locations have addresses 0,1,2.....
+ Ifthe word-length is 32 bits, successive words are located at addresses 0, 4,8. . with each word

having 4 bytes.

BIG-ENDIAN & LITTLE-ENDIAN ASSIGNMENTS
* There are two ways in which byte-addresses are arranged (Figure 2.3).
1) Big-Endian: Lower byte-addresses are used for the more significant bytes of the word.
2) Little-Endian: Lower byte-addresses are used for the less significant bytes of the word
are taken as the addresses of successive words in the
