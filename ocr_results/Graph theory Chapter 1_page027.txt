We observe that this graph is not a complete bipartite graph. Becauats there if ng edge
between every vertex in V; and every vertex in V2; for example, there is no edge joining ®
and R.

Prove that the k-dimensional hypercube Q; has k2*-! edges.
Determine the number of edges in Qs.

> Inthe hypercube Q,, the number of vertices is 2* and each vertex is of degree k. Therefore,
the sum of degrees of vertices of Q; is k x 2*. By handshaking property, we should hav

kx 2* = 2/E|, where |E| is the size of Q,. Thus, |E| = $(k x 2") = kx 2*-!. This means that QO, —
has k2*-! edges.

It follows that the number of edges in Qg is 8 x 27 = 1024.

(a) What is the dimension of the hypercube with 524288 edges?

(b) How many vertices are there in a hypercube with 4980736 edges?

> For the k-dimensional hypercube Q;, the number of vertices is 2‘ and the number of edges |
is 1, ;

(a) If Q, has 524288 edges, we have k2*-! = 524288. We check that
524288 = 29 = 24 x 2!5 = 16x 2)5,

Accordingly, k2'"! = 524288 holds if k = 16. Thus,

; the dimension of the hypercube
with 524288 edges is k = 16.

(b) We check that 4980736 = 19 x 2!8, which indicates that On
k

: has 4980736 edges
= 19. The number of vertices in this hypercube is 2 = 2!9 = 524288.
