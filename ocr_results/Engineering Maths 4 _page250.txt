¢ These valueg are used to find the.fourth unknown.

e  Allthese four values when substituted in the assumed form of w will give us the
required bilinear transformation. ,

“1. Find the ‘bilinear transformation which map the points z = 1,i, —1, into
w = i,.0,—-i. Under-this transfortnation find. the image of .| z <1 .

>> Let w= be the required bilinear transformation.

Weshall substitute the givenvaluesof z and w toobtain three equations as follows.

z=1, w =i gives potee

ie, ‘-a+b-ci+di=0 , ...(3)
Now (1) + (3) gives 2b - 2i = 0

-We shall solve (2) and (4) by writing them in the form
ia+1b+0c=0 .. (2)
Oat+ib-ic=0 - 1. (4)

Applying the rule of cross multiplication we have,
