Chapter 6 Basic SQL

language because they were not at the conceptual schema level. Many sys-
tems still have the CREATE INDEX commands; but they require a special
privilege. We describe this in Chapter 17.

= SQL has transaction control commands. These are used to specify units of
database processing for concurrency control and recovery purposes. We
discuss these commands in Chapter 20 after we discuss the concept of trans-
actions in more detail.

= SQL has language constructs for specifying the granting and revoking of
privileges to users. Privileges typically correspond to the right to use certain
SQL commands to access certain relations. Each relation is assigned an
owner, and either the owner or the DBA staff can grant to selected users the
privilege to use an SQL statement—such as SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, or
UPDATE—to access the relation. In addition, the DBA staff can grant the
privileges to create schemas, tables, or views to certain users. These SQL
commands—called GRANT and REVOKE—are discussed in Chapter 20,
where we discuss database security and authorization.

= SQL has language constructs for creating triggers. These are generally
referred to as active database techniques, since they specify actions that are
automatically triggered by events such as database updates. We discuss these
features in Section 26.1, where we discuss active database concepts.

= SQL has incorporated many features from object-oriented models to have
more powerful capabilities, leading to enhanced relational systems known
as object-relational. Capabilities such as creating complex-structured attri-
butes, specifying abstract data types (called UDTs or user-defined types) for
attributes and tables, creating object identifiers for referencing tuples, and
specifying operations on types are discussed in Chapter 12.

= SQL and relational databases can interact with new technologies such as
XML (see Chapter 13) and OLAP/data warehouses (Chapter 29).

6.6 Summary

In this chapter, we introduced the SQL database language. This language and its
variations have been implemented as interfaces to many commercial relational
DBMSs, including Oracle’s Oracle; ibm’s DB2; Microsoft's SQL Server; and many
other systems including Sybase and INGRES. Some open source systems also provide
SQL, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. The original version of SQL was imple-
mented in the experimental DBMS called SYSTEM R, which was developed at IBM
Research. SQL is designed to be a comprehensive language that includes statements
for data definition, queries, updates, constraint specification, and view definition.
We discussed the following features of SQL in this chapter: the data definition com-
mands for creating tables, SQL basic data types, commands for constraint specifica-
tion, simple retrieval queries, and database update commands. In the next chapter,
we will present the following features of SQL: complex retrieval queries; views; trig-
gers and assertions; and schema modification commands.
