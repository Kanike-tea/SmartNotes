We wish to teat the null hypothesis Hy that there is no differerice between the
population with regard to the attribute.
The statistic for this test is given by
: Py -P. My Py +My jy
Za here p= 2 and g= 1-7
pq (1/1, + V/ny ) : . ny +My
*We adopt the same procedure for testirig the null hypothesis by using one tailed test

or two tailed tes'

e Test of selatene for small samples

In the case of large samples, sampling distribution follows anormal distribution which

"isnot true in the case of small samples. We introduce the concept of degrees of freedom

for discussing Student's t distribution ..
© Degrees of freedom -

The number ‘of degrees of freedom (d-f) usually denoted by v is the number of
values in a set which may be assigned arbitrarily. It can be interpreted as the number
of independent values generated by a sample of small size for estimating a population
parameter, = a *

"Examples : Let us suppose that we need to find 3 numbers whose sum is 25. That is to

find a, b, c such that a+b+c = 25. We can arbitrarily assign values to any two of
the variables a,,b, ¢ and hence these are the degrees of freedom. That is to say that
d-f(v) = 2. Ifthere are n observations d-f is equal to(-1).

Suppose that we'are finding the mean of a sample of size n comprising values
Xy) Xp, $++%, We useall the 7 values to compute the sample mean x. Then x is

_ said to have n degrees of freedom.

Suppose we are finding the sample variance, we use then values
(xy- 2, (xg 2, (are

But these values donot have n- degrees of freedom as they all depend ona fixed value
x which has already been computed. Hence the sample variance is said to have
(n-1) d-f. Ifwe compute another statistic based on the sample mean and variance,
that statistic is said to have (n-2) d+ f and so on. In general the number of degrees
of freedom v = n—k where n is the number of observations in the sample and k is
the number of constraints / number of values which are pre determined.
