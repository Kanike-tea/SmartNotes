26.3 Spatial Database Concepts

update. A representative example of dynamic operations would be updating a spa-
tial object that can be subdivided into translate (shift position), rotate (change ori-
entation), scale up or down, reflect (produce a mirror image), and shear (deform).

Spatial Queries. Spatial queries are requests for spatial data that require the
use of spatial operations. The following categories illustrate three typical types of
spatial queries:

= Range queries. Find all objects of a particular type that are within a given
spatial area; for example, find all hospitals within the Metropolitan Atlanta
city area. A variation of this query is to find all objects within a particular
distance from a given location; for example, find all ambulances within a
five mile radius of an accident location.

= Nearest neighbor queries. Finds an object of a particular type that is closest
to a given location; for example, find the police car that is closest to the loca-
tion of a crime. This can be generalized to find the k nearest neighbors, such
as the 5 closest ambulances to an accident location.

= Spatial joins or overlays. Typically joins the objects of two types based on
some spatial condition, such as the objects intersecting or overlapping spa-
tially or being within a certain distance of one another. For example, find all
townships located on a major highway between two cities or find all homes
that are within two miles of a lake. The first example spatially joins township
objects and highway object, and the second example spatially joins lake
objects and home objects.

26.3.4 Spatial Data Indexing

A spatial index is used to organize objects into a set of buckets (which correspond
to pages of secondary memory), so that objects in a particular spatial region can be
easily located. Each bucket has a bucket region, a part of space containing all objects
stored in the bucket. The bucket regions are usually rectangles; for point data struc-
tures, these regions are disjoint and they partition the space so that each point
belongs to precisely one bucket. There are essentially two

1. Specialized indexing structures that allow efficient search for data objects
based on spatial search operations are included in the database system.
These indexing structures would play a similar role to that performed by
B*-tree indexes in traditional database systems. Examples of these indexing
structures are grid files and R-trees. Special types of spatial indexes, known as
spatial join indexes, can be used to speed up spatial join operations.

2. Instead of creating brand new indexing structures, the two-dimensional (2-D)
spatial data is converted to single-dimensional (1-D) data, so that traditional
indexing techniques (B*-tree) can be used. The algorithms for converting
from 2-D to 1-D are known as space filling curves. We will not discuss these
methods in detail (see the Selected Bibliography for further references).

We give an overview of some of the spatial indexing techniques next.
