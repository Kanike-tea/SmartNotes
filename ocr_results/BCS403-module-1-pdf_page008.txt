Database Management System [BCS403]

A database typically has many users, each of whom may require a different perspectiveor
viewof the database. A view may be a subset of the database or it may containvirtual data that
is derived from the database files but is not explicitly stored. A multiuser DBMS whose users
have a variety of distinct applications mustprovide facilities for defining multiple views. For
example, one user of the databaseof Figure 1.2 may be interested only in accessing and printing

the transcript of eachstudent; the view for this user is shown in Figure 1.2(b)

4, Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaetion Processing

A multiuser DBMS, as its name implies,must allow multiple users to access the database

at the same time. This is essential if data for multiple applications is to be integratedand
maintained in a single database. The DBMS must include concurrencycontrol software to ensure
that several users trying to update the same data do so ina controlled manner so that the result of
the updates is correct. For example, whenseveral reservation agents try to assign a seat on an
airline flight, the DBMS shouldensure that each seat can be accessed by only one agent at a time
for assignment to apassenger. These types of applications are generally called online transaction
processing(OLTP) applications. A fundamental role of multiuser DBMS software is toensure that

concurrent transactions operate correctly and efficiently.

The concept of a transaction has become central to many database applications. Atransaction is an
executing program or process that includes one or more databaseaccesses, such as reading or
updating of database records. The DBMS must enforce several transaction properties. The
isolation property ensures that each transaction appears to executein isolation from other
transactions, even though hundreds of transactions may beexecuting concurrently. The atomicity

property ensures that either all the databaseoperations in a transaction are executed or none are.
