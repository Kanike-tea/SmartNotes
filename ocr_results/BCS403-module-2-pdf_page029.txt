OPERATION PURPOSE NOTATION
SELECT Selects all tuples that satisfy the selection condition CAE oda)
from a relation R.
PROJECT Produces a new relation with only some of the attrib- 1 (R)

utes of R, and removes duplicate tuples.

THETA JOIN Produces all combinations of tuples from R, and R, Ri

R,
that satisfy the join condition. 7

<join condition>

EQUUOIN Produces all the combinations of tuples from R, and Ry Poin condietons Rar OR
R, that satisfy a join condition with only equality Ry? (join atrioates ta
comparisons. (join attributas 2) Bea

NATURAL JOIN Same as EQUIJOIN except that the join attributes of Ry Ry¥ hs condition» Ro
are not included in the resulting relation; if the join PM aioin ales
attributes have the same names, they do not have to Rs,
be specified at all. ORR,» R,

UNION Produces a relation that includes all the tuples in R, R, UR,
or R, or both R, and R,; R, and R, must be union 7
compatible.

INTERSECTION Produces a relation that includes.all the tuples in both R, 0 R,
R, and R,; R, and R, must be union compatible. 7

DIFFERENCE Produces a relation that includes all the tuples in R, R,-R,
that are not in R,; R, and R, must be union compatible.
CARTESIAN Produces a relation that has the attributes of R, and R, XR,

PRODUCT R, and includes as tuples all possible combinations of
tuples from R, and R;.

DIVISION Produces afelation R(X) that includes all tuples |X] R,(Z) + RY)
in R,(Z) that appear in R, in combination with every
tuple from R,(Y), where Z=X WU Y.

2.4.5 Notation for Query Trees

Query tree (query evaluation tree or query execution tree) is used in relational systems to represent
queries internally. A query tree is a tree data structure that corresponds to a relational algebra
expression. It represents the input relations of the query as leaf nodes of the tree, and represents the

relational algebra operations as internal nodes.

An execution of the query tree consists of executing an internal node operation whenever its
operands represented by its child nodes are available, and then replacing that internal node by the
relation that results from executing the operation. The execution terminates when the root node is

executed and produces the result relation for the query.
