3:8 Decoder
« A3 to 8 decoder has three inputs (x,y,z) and eight outputs (DO to D7).
e Based on the 3 inputs one of the eight outputs is selected.
e The truth table for 3 to 8 decoder is shown in the below table.

« From the truth table, it is seen that only one of eight outputs (DO to D7) is selected
based on three select inputs.

« From the truth table, the logic expressions for outputs can be written as follows:
