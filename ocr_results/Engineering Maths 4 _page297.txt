Using this result in (1) along with 1. = np we have

Variance (V) = {n(n-1) P+np} —(npy?
= Pan enp—ap? = np(1-p) = npq
Hence variance (V) = n Pq
SD (6) = W = Vupq
Thus we have for the Binomial Distribution,
Mean (1) = np and SD (o) = \apq

Note: The usual notation x for the mean can also be used.

Poisson Distribution

Poisson distribution is regarded as the limiting form of the binomial distribution when: . ©
n is very large (n — ©) and p the probability of success is very small (p> 0)
so that np tends toa fixed finite constant say m.

We have in the case of binomial distribution, the
trials, '

P(x) ="C, p* q™-*
