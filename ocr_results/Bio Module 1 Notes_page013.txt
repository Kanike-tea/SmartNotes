Properties of Nucleic Acids

A. Physical Properties

Solubility: Nucleic acids are hydrophilic and dissolve in water but are insoluble in
organic solvents like ethanol and chloroform.

Viscosity: DNA solutions are highly viscous due to their large molecular size and
helical structure.

Absorption of UV Light: Nucleic acids absorb ultraviolet (UV) light at 260 nm,
which helps in their quantification.

Denaturation and Renaturation: DNA strands can separate (denature) upon heating

and reanneal upon cooling, which is important in replication and PCR.

B. Chemical Properties

Polymer Structure: Nucleic acids are long-chain polymers of nucleotides, linked by
phosphodiester bonds.

Acidic Nature: Due to the phosphate groups, nucleic acids behave as acids.
Hydrolysis: DNA and RNA can be broken down into nucleotides by enzymes like
nucleases.

Base Pairing: DNA follows Chargaff’s rule (A pairs with T, C pairs with G) via

hydrogen bonds, giving it a double-helical structure.

Functions of Nucleic acids

Nucleic acids, primarily DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), play

essential roles in the storage, transmission, and expression of genetic information. Their main

functions include:

Genetic Information Storage (DNA) — DNA stores genetic information that
determines the traits and functions of an organism. It carries instructions for protein
synthesis and cellular activities.
Genetic Transmission (DNA & RNA) — DNA transmits genetic information from one
generation to the next through replication. RNA helps in the expression of this genetic
information.
Protein Synthesis (RNA) — RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis:

o mRNA (messenger RNA) carries the genetic code from DNA to ribosomes.

o tRNA (transfer RNA) transports amino acids to the ribosomes.
