For example:

The M:N relationship taught-by between entities COURSE and FACULTY should be
represented as a new table. The structure of the table will include primary key of COURSE
and primary key of FACULTY entities.

TAUGHT-BY (ID (primary key of FACULTY table), course-id (primary key of COURSE
table)

N-ary Relationship:
For each N-ary relationship type R where n>2, we create a new table S to represent R, We
include as foreign key attributes in S the primary keys of the relations that represent the
participating entity types. We also include any simple attributes of the N-ary relationship type
(or simple components of complete attribute) as attributes of S. The primary key of S is
usually a combination of all the foreign keys that reference the relations representing the
participating entity types.

Customer Loan

Employee

LOAN-SANCTION (cusomer-id, loanno, empno, sancdate, loan_amount)

Multi-Valued Attributes:

For each multivalued attribute ‘A’, we create a new relation R that includes an attribute
corresponding to plus the primary key attributes k of the relation that represents the entity
type or relationship that has as an attribute. The primary key of R is then combination of A
and k.

For example, if a STUDENT entity has rollno, name and phone number where phone number
is a multivalued attribute then we will create table PHONE (rollno, phoneno) where primary
key is the combination. In the STUDENT table we need not have phone number, instead if
can be simply (rollno, name) only.

PHONE(rollno, phoneno)
