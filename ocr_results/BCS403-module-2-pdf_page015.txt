Database Management System [BCS403]

The Boolean expression specified in <selection condition> is made up of a number of clauses of the

form:
<attribute name> <comparison op> <constant value>
or
<attribute name> <comparison op> <attribute name>
where

<attribute name> is the name of an attribute of R,
<comparison op> is one of the operators {=, <<, >, >, #}, and
<constant value> is a constant value from the attribute domain

Clauses can be connected by the standard Boolean operators and, or, and not to form a general

selection condition

Examples:
1. Select the EMPLOYEE tuples whose department number is 4.
© pyo=4 (EMPLOYEE)
2. Select the employee tuples whose salary is greater than $30,000:
© sacary > 30,000 (EMPLOYEE)

3. Select the tuples for all employees who either work in department 4 and make over $25,000
per year, or work in department 5 and make over $30,000

©(Dn0=4 AND Salary>25000) OR (pno=5 AND Salary>30000(EMPLOYEE)
The result ofa SELECT operation can be determined as follows:
+ The <selection condition> is applied independently to each individual tuple t in R

+ Ifthe condition evaluates to TRUE, then tuple ¢ is selected.All the selected tuples appear in
the result of the SELECT operation

* The Boolean conditions AND, OR, and NOT have their normal interpretation, as follows:

- (cond! AND cond2) is TRUE if both (cond!) and (cond2) are TRUE; otherwise, it is
FALSE.

- (cond! OR cond2) is TRUE if either (cond1) or (cond2) or both are TRUE; otherwise, it is
FALSE.

- (NOT cond) is TRUE if cond is FALSE; otherwise, it is FALSE.
