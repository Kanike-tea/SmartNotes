Chapter 30 Database Security

30.1 Introduction to Database Security Issues!

30.1.1 Types of Security

Database security is a broad area that addresses many issues, including the following:

= Various legal and ethical issues regarding the right to access certain infor-
mation—for example, some information may be deemed to be private and
cannot be accessed legally by unauthorized organizations or persons. In the
United States, there are numerous laws governing privacy of information.

= Policy issues at the governmental, institutional, or corporate level regarding
what kinds of information should not be made publicly available—for
example, credit ratings and personal medical records.

= System-related issues such as the system levels at which various security
functions should be enforced—for example, whether a security function
should be handled at the physical hardware level, the operating system level,
or the DBMS level.

= The need in some organizations to identify multiple security levels and to
categorize the data and users based on these classifications—for example,
top secret, secret, confidential, and unclassified. The security policy of the
organization with respect to permitting access to various classifications of
data must be enforced.

Threats to Databases. Threats to databases can result in the loss or degradation
of some or all of the following commonly accepted security goals: integrity, avail-
ability, and confidentiality.

= Loss of integrity. Database integrity refers to the requirement that informa-
tion be protected from improper modification. Modification of data includes
creating, inserting, and updating data; changing the status of data; and delet-
ing data. Integrity is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data by
either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system or data integrity is
not corrected, continued use of the contaminated system or corrupted data
could result in inaccuracy, fraud, or erroneous decisions.

= Loss of availability. Database availability refers to making objects available to a
human user or a program who/which has a legitimate right to those data objects.
Loss of availability occurs when the user or program cannot access these objects.

= Loss of confidentiality. Database confidentiality refers to the protection of
data from unauthorized disclosure. The impact of unauthorized disclosure
of confidential information can range from violation of the Data Privacy Act
to the jeopardization of national security. Unauthorized, unanticipated, or
unintentional disclosure could result in loss of public confidence, embar-
rassment, or legal action against the organization.
