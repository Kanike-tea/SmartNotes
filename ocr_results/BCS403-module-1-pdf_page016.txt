Database Management System [BCS403]

When Not to Use a DBMS
= DBMS may involve unnecessary overhead costs that would not be incurred in _ traditional
file processing. The overhead costs of using a DBMS are due to the following:
e High initial investment in hardware, software, and training
e The generality that a DBMS provides for defining and processing data
e Overhead for providing security, concurrency control, recovery, and integrity
functions
«Therefore, it may be more desirable to use regular files under the following circumstances:
e Simple, well-defined database applications that are not expected to,change at all
© Stringent, real-time requirements for some application programs that may not be
met because of DBMS overhead
« Embedded systems with limited storage capacity, where a general-purpose DBMS
would not fit

« No multiple-user access to data
