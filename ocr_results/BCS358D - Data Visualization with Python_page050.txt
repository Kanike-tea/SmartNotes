LAB PROGRAM 04 (b)
4b) Write a Python program to Demonstrate how to Draw a Scatter Plot using Matplotlib.

Aim: Demonstration of how to draw a Scatter Plot using Matplotlib.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

The below program demonstrates how to draw a scatter plot using Matplotlib. Make sure you
have Matplotlib installed before running this code. You can install it using pip if you haven't
already:

pip install matplotlib

1. Import Matplotlib: The script begins by importing the ‘pyplot’ module from the
Matplotlib library as ‘p1t’. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python,
and ‘pyplot’ is a subpackage that provides a simple interface for creating various types
of plots, including scatter plots.

2. Define Sample Data: Two lists, ‘x’ and ‘y’ , are defined. These lists represent the data
points that will be plotted on the scatter plot. In this example, ‘x’ represents the x-axis
values, and ‘y’ represents the corresponding y-axis values.

3. Create a Scatter Plot: The ‘plt.scatter()’ function is used to create a scatter plot.
This function takes several arguments:

e ‘x’ and ‘y’ are the data points to be plotted on the x and y axes.

e ‘label’ is set to 'Data Points’, which is used for the legend.

© ‘color’ is set to 'blue', specifying the color of the markers in the scatter plot.

e ‘marker’ is set to 'o', which indicates that circular markers (dots) should be used
for each data point.

4. Add Labels and Title: The ‘plt.xlabel()’, ‘plt.ylabel()’, and

‘plt.title()’ functions are used to add labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and a title to the

scatter plot. In this example, 'X-Axis' is set as the x-axis label, 'Y-Axis' as the y-axis
label, and 'Scatter Plot Example' as the title.

5. Add a Legend: The ‘plt.legend()’ function is called to add a legend to the scatter
plot. The legend displays the label 'Data Points' to indicate what the data points on the
plot represent.

6. Show the Plot: Finally, the ‘plt.show()’ function is called to display the created

scatter plot on the screen. This function should be the last line of the script.
