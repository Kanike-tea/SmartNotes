Disk Storage, Basic File
Structures, Hashing, and Modern
Storage Architectures

[ast are stored physically as files of records,
which are typically stored on magnetic disks. This
chapter and the next deal with the organization of databases in storage and the
techniques for accessing them efficiently using various algorithms, some of which
require auxiliary data structures called indexes. These structures are often referred
to as physical database file structures and are at the physical level of the three-
schema architecture described in Chapter 2. We start in Section 16.1 by introducing
the concepts of computer storage hierarchies and how they are used in database
systems. Section 16.2 is devoted to a description of magnetic disk storage devices
and their characteristics, flash memory, and solid-state drives and optical drives
and magnetic tape storage devices used for archiving data. We also discuss tech-
niques for making access from disks more efficient. After discussing different stor-
age technologies, we turn our attention to the methods for physically organizing
data on disks. Section 16.3 covers the technique of double buffering, which is used
to speed retrieval of multiple disk blocks. We also discuss buffer management and
buffer replacement strategies. In Section 16.4 we discuss various ways of formatting
and storing file records on disk. Section 16.5 discusses the various types of opera-
tions that are typically applied to file records. We present three primary methods
for organizing file records on disk: unordered records, in Section 16.6; ordered
records, in Section 16.7; and hashed records, in Section 16.8.

Section 16.9 briefly introduces files of mixed records and other primary methods
for organizing records, such as B-trees. These are particularly relevant for storage of
object-oriented databases, which we discussed in Chapter 11. Section 16.10
