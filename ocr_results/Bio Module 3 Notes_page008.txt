Robotic Arm Prosthetic by Brain-Machine Interfaces

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are a type of technology that allows a user to control a robotic
arm prosthetic directly with their brain activity. The system typically involves electrodes placed
on the scalp or implanted directly into the brain to detect and interpret the user's brain signals.

When the user thinks about moving the prosthetic arm, the electrodes detect the
corresponding brain activity and send the signals to a control unit, which uses algorithms to
interpret the signals and control the movement of the prosthetic. The user can then control the
movement of the prosthetic in real-time by thinking about the desired movement.

BMIs have the advantage of providing a direct and intuitive connection between the user's
brain and the prosthetic, allowing for a high level of control and precision. Additionally, BMIs can
be used to provide sensory feedback to the user, allowing them to experience the sensation of touch
through the prosthetic.

However, BMIs can be complex and invasive systems, requiring surgical implantation and
ongoing maintenance to ensure proper function. Additionally, they may not be suitable for
individuals with conditions that affect brain activity or who are unable to generate strong enough
brain signals to control the prosthetic effectively. Ongoing research and development is aimed at
improving the performance and accessibility of BMIs, as well as increasing their ease of use and
reliability.

Parkinson’s Disease

It is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body
controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable
tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing
of movement.

In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or
die. Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your
