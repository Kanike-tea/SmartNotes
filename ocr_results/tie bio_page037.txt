I. Diagnose diseases

Correctly diagnosing diseases takes years of medical training. Even then, diagnostics is often
an arduous, time-consuming process. In many fields, the demand for experts far exceeds
the available supply. This puts doctors under strain and often delays life-saving patient
diagnostics.

Machine Learning — particularly Deep Learning algorithms — have recently made huge
advances in automatically diagnosing diseases, making diagnostics cheaper and more
accessible.

How machines learn to diagnose-

Machine Learning algorithms can learn to see patterns similarly to the way doctors see them.
A key difference is that algorithms need a lot of concrete examples — many thousands — in
order to learn. And these examples need to be neatly digitized — machines can’t read between
the lines in textbooks.

So Machine Learning is particularly helpful in areas where the diagnostic information a
doctor examines is already digitized.

Such as:

« Detecting lung cancer or strokes based on CT scans

e Assessing the risk of sudden cardiac death or other heart diseases based
on electrocardiograms and cardiac MRI images

e Classifying skin lesions in skin images

e Finding indicators of diabetic retinopathy in eye images

a

Detecting lung cancer Assess cardiac health Classify skin lesions Identify retinopathy
from CT Scans from electrocardiograms from images of the skin from eye images

Since there is plenty of good data available in these cases, algorithms are becoming just as
good at diagnostics as the experts. The difference is: the algorithm can draw conclusions in
a fraction of a second, and it can be reproduced inexpensively all over the world. Soon
everyone, everywhere could have access to the same quality of top expert in radiology
diagnostics, and for a low price.
