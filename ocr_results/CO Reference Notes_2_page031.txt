A Detailed Timing Diagram for the Read-operation

¢ The picture shows two views of the signal except the clock (Figure 7.4).

© One view shows the signal seen by the master & the other is seen by the salve.

¢ Master sends the address & command signals on the rising edge at the beginning of clock period (tO).
These signals do not actually appear on the bus until tam.

¢ Sometimes later, at tAS the signals reach the slave.

The slave decodes the address.

¢ At tl, the slave sends the requested-data.

¢ At t2, the master loads the data into its input-buffer.

¢ Hence the period t2,tDM is the setup time for the master’s input-buffer.

¢ The data must be continued to be valid after t2, for a period equal to the hold time of that buffers.

Disadvantages
© The device does not respond.
¢ The error will not be detected.

Figure 7.5 An input transfer using multiple clock cycles.

During, clock cycle-1, master sends address/command info the bus requesting a “read“ operation.
The slave receives & decodes address/command information (Figure 7.5).

¢ At the active edge of the clock i.e. the beginning of clock cycle-2, it makes accession to

respond immediately.

© The data become ready & are placed in the bus at clock cycle-3.

¢ At the same times, the slave asserts a control signal called slave-ready.

¢ The master strobes the data to its input-buffer at the end of clock cycle-3.

¢ The bus transfer operation is now complete.

¢ And the master sends a new address to start a new transfer in clock cycle4.

¢ The slave-ready signal is an acknowledgement from the slave to the master.

ASYNCHRONOUS BUS
¢ This method uses handshake-signals between master and slave for coordinating data-transfers.
There are 2 control-lines:

1) Master-Ready (MR) is used to indicate that master is ready for a transaction.

2) Slave-Ready (SR) is used to indicate that slave is ready for a transaction.
