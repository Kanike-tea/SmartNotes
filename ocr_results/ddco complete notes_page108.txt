e The I/O device is connected to interrupt request line by means of switch,
which is grounded asshown in the fig.

e When all the switches are open the voltage drop on interrupt request line is
equal to the Vpp andINTR value at process is 0.

e This state is called as in-active state of the interrupt request line.

e The I/O device interrupts the processor by closing its switch.

e When switch is closed the voltage drop on the interrupt request line is found
to be zero, as theswitch is grounded, hence INTR=0 and INTR=1.

e The signal on the interrupt request line is logical OR of requests from the
several I /O devices. Therefore, INTR=INTRI + INTR2 + + INTRn

The arrival of interrupt request from external devices or from within a process,
causes the suspension ofon-going execution and start the execution of another
program.

e Interrupt arrives at any time and it alters the sequence of execution. Hence
the interrupt to beexecuted must be selected carefully.

e All computers can enable and disable interruptions as desired.
e When an interrupt is under execution, other interrupts should not be

invoked. This is performedin a system in different ways.

e The problem of infinite loop occurs due to successive interruptions of active
INTR signals.
