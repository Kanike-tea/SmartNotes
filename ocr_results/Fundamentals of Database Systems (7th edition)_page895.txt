23.6 Types of Distributed Database Systems

example, consider the query Q: Retrieve the names and hours per week for each
employee who works on some project controlled by department 5. This can be speci-
fied in SQL on the schema in Figure 5.5 as follows:

Q: SELECT Fname, Lname, Hours
FROM EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON
WHERE Dnum=5 AND Prumber=Pno AND Essn=Ssn;

Suppose that the query is submitted at site 2, which is where the query result will be
needed. The DDBMS can determine from the guard condition on PROJS5 and
WORKS_ONS that all tuples satisfying the conditions (Dnum = 5 AND Pnumber = Pno)
reside at site 2. Hence, it may decompose the query into the following relational alge-
bra subqueries:

Ty © Tesen(PROJSS pn umberProWORKS_ONS)
T2 © Teegsn, Fname, Lname( Ty Essn—SsnEMPLOYEE)
RESULT < TlFname, Lname, Hours(1* WORKS_ONS)

This decomposition can be used to execute the query by using a semijoin strategy.
The DDBMS knows from the guard conditions that PROJS5 contains exactly those
tuples satisfying (Dnum = 5) and that WORKS_ONS contains all tuples to be joined
with PROJSS5; hence, subquery T, can be executed at site 2, and the projected column.
Essn can be sent to site 1. Subquery T, can then be executed at site 1, and the result
can be sent back to site 2, where the final query result is calculated and displayed to
the user. An alternative strategy would be to send the query Q itself to site 1, which
includes all the database tuples, where it would be executed locally and from which
the result would be sent back to site 2. The query optimizer would estimate the costs
of both strategies and would choose the one with the lower cost estimate.

23.6 Types of Distributed Database Systems

The term distributed database management system can describe various systems
that differ from one another in many respects. The main thing that all such systems
have in common is the fact that data and software are distributed over multiple sites
connected by some form of communication network. In this section, we discuss a
number of types of DDBMSs and the criteria and factors that make some of these
systems different.

The first factor we consider is the degree of homogeneity of the DDBMS software. If
all servers (or individual local DBMSs) use identical software and all users (clients) use
identical software, the DDBMS is called homogeneous; otherwise, it is called hetero-
geneous. Another factor related to the degree of homogeneity is the degree of local
autonomy. If there is no provision for the local site to function as a standalone DBMS,
then the system has no local autonomy. On the other hand, if direct access by local
transactions to a server is permitted, the system has some degree of local autonomy.

Figure 23.6 shows classification of DDBMS alternatives along orthogonal axes of
distribution, autonomy, and heterogeneity. For a centralized database, there is
