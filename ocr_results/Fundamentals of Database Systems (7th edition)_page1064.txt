1034 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

With some reasonable assumptions and estimates about the probabilistic model
along with extensions for incorporating query term weights and document term
weights in the model, a probabilistic ranking algorithm called BM25 (Best Match
25) is quite popular. This weighting scheme has evolved from several versions of
the Okapi'* system.

The Okapi weight for document dj and query q is computed by the formula below.
Additional notations are as follows:
= ¢,isaterm.
= fj is the raw frequency count of term f; in document dj.
™ fiq is the raw frequency count of term ¢; in query q.
Nis the total number of documents in the collection.
df; is the number of documents that contain the term fj.
di; is the document length (in bytes) of dj.

avdl is the average document length of the collection.

The Okapi relevance score of a document dj for a query q is given by the equa-
tion below, where k, (between 1.0-2.0), b (usually 0.75), and ky (between 1-1,000)
are parameters:

27.2.4 Semantic Model

However sophisticated the above statistical models become, they can miss many
relevant documents because those models do not capture the complete meaning or
information need conveyed by a user’s query. In semantic models, the process of
matching documents to a given query is based on concept level and semantic
matching instead of index term (keyword) matching. This allows retrieval of rele-
vant documents that share meaningful associations with other documents in the
query result, even when these associations are not inherently observed or statisti-
cally captured.

Semantic approaches include different levels of analysis, such as morphological,
syntactic, and semantic analysis, to retrieve documents more effectively. In
morphological analysis, roots and affixes are analyzed to determine the parts of
speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on) of the words. Following morphological
analysis, syntactic analysis follows to parse and analyze complete phrases in docu-
ments. Finally, the semantic methods have to resolve word ambiguities and/or
generate relevant synonyms based on the semantic relationships among levels of
structural entities in documents (words, paragraphs, pages, or entire documents).
