Microcontrollers - BCS402

e Payload copied into SRAM, address 0x00000000.
¢ Control of the pe is relinquished to the payload; pe = 0x00000000.

e The system is completely booted. The following output is shown on the serial port:

Sandstone Firmware (0.01)

- platform ......... e7t
- status ........... alive
- Memory ......eeeee remapped

+ booting payload ...

Simple Little OS (0.09)

- initialized ...... ok
- running on ....... e7vt
e7t:

To summarize, Sandstone initializes the hardware and then loads and boots an image following

this procedure:

e Takes the Reset exception.

e Starts initializing the hardware; sets the system register’s base address and initializes
segment display hardware.

e¢ Remaps memory; ROM address = high addr and SRAM addr = 0x00000000.

e Initializes the communication hardware output on the serial port.

¢ Bootloader—loads an image into SRAM and relinquishes control of the pe to the image

(pe = 0x00000000).
