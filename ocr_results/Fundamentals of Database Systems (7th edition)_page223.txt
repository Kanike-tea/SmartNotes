6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL 193

Queries 9 and 10. Select all EMPLOYEE Ssns (Q9) and all combinations of
EMPLOYEE Ssn and DEPARTMENT Dname (Q10) in the database.

Qs: SELECT Ssn
FROM EMPLOYEE;

Q10: SELECT Ssn, Dname
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;

It is extremely important to specify every selection and join condition in the WHERE
clause; if any such condition is overlooked, incorrect and very large relations may
result. Notice that Q10 is similar to a CROSS PRODUCT operation followed by a
PROJECT operation in relational algebra (see Chapter 8). If we specify all the attri-
butes of EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT in Q10, we get the actual CROSS PRODUCT
(except for duplicate elimination, if any).

To retrieve all the attribute values of the selected tuples, we do not have to list the
attribute names explicitly in SQL; we just specify an asterisk (*), which stands for all
the attributes. The * can also be prefixed by the relation name or alias; for example,
EMPLOYEE.’ refers to all attributes of the EMPLOYEE table.

Query QI1C retrieves all the attribute values of any EMPLOYEE who works in
DEPARTMENT number 5 (Figure 6.3(g)), query Q1D retrieves all the attributes of an
EMPLOYEE and the attributes of the DEPARTMENT in which he or she works for
every employee of the ‘Research’ department, and Q10A specifies the CROSS
PRODUCT of the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT relations.

Qic: SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dno=5;

Q1D: SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
WHERE Dname = ‘Research’ AND Dno = Dnumber;

Q10A: SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;

6.3.4 Tables as Sets in SQL

As we mentioned earlier, SQL usually treats a table not as a set but rather as a multiset;
duplicate tuples can appear more than once in a table, and in the result of a query.
SQL does not automatically eliminate duplicate tuples in the results of queries, for
the following reasons:

= Duplicate elimination is an expensive operation. One way to implement it is
to sort the tuples first and then eliminate duplicates.
= The user may want to see duplicate tuples in the result of a query.

= When an aggregate function (see Section 7.1.7) is applied to tuples, in most
cases we do not want to eliminate duplicates.
