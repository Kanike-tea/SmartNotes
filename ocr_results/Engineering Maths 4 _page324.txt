The integral in the RHS of (2) geometrically represents the area bounded by the
standard normal curve.F (z) between z = z, and z= zy. Further in particular if
z, = 0 wehave -

This represents the area under the standard normal curve from z = 0 to z.

6(z) also denoted by A(z) represents the area (shaded portion) as shown in the
figure. Since the total area is 1, the area on either side of z = 0 is 0.5.

- Tabulated values which gives the area for different positive values of z are available
