30.7 Encryption and Public Key Infrastructures

channels can be classified into two broad categories: timing channels and storage.
The distinguishing feature between the two is that in a timing channel the infor-
mation is conveyed by the timing of events or processes, whereas storage channels
do not require any temporal synchronization, in that information is conveyed by
accessing system information or what is otherwise inaccessible to the user.

In a simple example of a covert channel, consider a distributed database system in
which two nodes have user security levels of secret (S) and unclassified (U). In order
for a transaction to commit, both nodes must agree to commit. They mutually can
only do operations that are consistent with the *-property, which states that in any
transaction, the S site cannot write or pass information to the U site. However, if
these two sites collude to set up a covert channel between them, a transaction
involving secret data may be committed unconditionally by the U site, but the S site
may do so in some predefined agreed-upon way so that certain information may be
passed from the S site to the U site, violating the *-property. This may be achieved
where the transaction runs repeatedly, but the actions taken by the S site implicitly
convey information to the U site. Measures such as locking, which we discussed in
Chapters 21 and 22, prevent concurrent writing of the information by users with
different security levels into the same objects, preventing the storage-type covert
channels. Operating systems and distributed databases provide control over the
multiprogramming of operations, which allows a sharing of resources without the
possibility of encroachment of one program or process into another’s memory or
other resources in the system, thus preventing timing-oriented covert channels. In
general, covert channels are not a major problem in well-implemented robust data-
base implementations. However, certain schemes may be contrived by clever users
that implicitly transfer information.

Some security experts believe that one way to avoid covert channels is to disallow
programmers to actually gain access to sensitive data that a program will process
after the program has been put into operation. For example, a programmer for a
bank has no need to access the names or balances in depositors’ accounts. Program-
mers for brokerage firms do not need to know what buy and sell orders exist for
clients. During program testing, access to a form of real data or some sample test
data may be justifiable, but not after the program has been accepted for regular use.

The previous methods of access and flow control, despite being strong control mea-
sures, may not be able to protect databases from some threats. Suppose we commu-
nicate data, but our data falls into the hands of a nonlegitimate user. In this situation,
by using encryption we can disguise the message so that even if the transmission is
diverted, the message will not be revealed. Encryption is the conversion of data into
a form, called a ciphertext, that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized per-
sons. It enhances security and privacy when access controls are bypassed, because
in cases of data loss or theft, encrypted data cannot be easily understood by unau-
thorized persons.
