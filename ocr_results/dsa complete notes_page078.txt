e If we are pointing to a specific NODE, say p, then we can move only in the direction of the
links. The only way to find the NODE that precedes p is to start at the beginning of the list.

e  Ifwe wish to delete an arbitrary NODE from a singly linked list. Easy deletion of an arbitrary
NODE requires knowing the preceding NODE.

¢ Can traverse only in one direction.

e Difficult to delete arbitrary NODEs.

Doubly Linked List representation
e Each NODE now has two link fields, one linking in the forward direction and the other
linking in the backward direction.

e ANODE ina doubly

inked list has at least three fields, a left link field (Ilink), a data field

(data), and a right link field (rlink). It can be represented as follows

+

—S

>

—S

Data

rin

A doubly linked list may or may not be circular. The data field of the header NODE usually contains

no information.

right e

If head is a pointer to the header NODE then head->l

ink= head-rlink= head
