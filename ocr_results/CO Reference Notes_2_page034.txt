INPUT-INTERFACE-CIRCUIT

Figure 4.30 Circuit for the status flag block in Figure 4.29.

¢ Output-lines of DATAIN are connected to the data-lines of bus by means of 3-state drivers (Fig 4.29).
Drivers are turned on when

— processor issues a read signal and

— address selects DATAIN.
¢ SIN signal is generated using a status-flag circuit (Figure 4.30).

SIN signal is connected to line DO of the processor-bus using a 3-state driver.
¢ Address-decoder selects the input-interface based on bits Al through A31.
Bit AO determines whether the status or data register is to be read, when Master-ready is active.
Processor activates the Slave-ready signal, when either the Read-status or Read-data is equal to 1.
