27.2 Retrieval Models

Here, D, stands for document-relevant (D,) and D,,, stands for document-nonrelevant
(Dy,); these terms represent relevant and nonrelevant document sets, respectively.
Terms from relevant and nonrelevant documents get added to the original query
vector with positive and negative weights, respectively, to create the modified query
vector. a, B, and y are parameters of the equation. The summation over d, repre-
sents summation over all relevant terms of document d,. Similarly, summation over
dy, represents summation over all nonrelevant terms of document d,,,. The values
of these parameters determine how the feedback affects the original query, and
these may be determined after a number of trial-and-error experiments.

27.2.3 Probabilistic Model

The similarity measures in the vector space model are somewhat ad hoc. For exam-
ple, the model assumes that those documents closer to the query in cosine space are
more relevant to the query vector. In the probabilistic model, a more concrete and
definitive approach is taken: ranking documents by their estimated probability of
relevance with respect to the query and the document. This is the basis of the prob-
ability ranking principle developed by Robertson.'!

In the probabilistic framework, the IR system must decide whether the documents
belong to the relevant set or the nonrelevant set for a query. To make this decision, it
is assumed that a predefined relevant set and nonrelevant set exist for the query, and
the task is to calculate the probability that the document belongs to the relevant set and
compare that with the probability that the document belongs to the nonrelevant set.

Given the document representation D of a document, estimating the relevance R
and nonrelevance NR of that document involves computation of conditional prob-
ability P(R|D) and P(NR|D). These conditional probabilities can be calculated using
Bayes’ rule:!*

P(R|D) = P(D|R) x P(R)/P(D)

P(NR|D) = P(D|NR) x P(NR)/P(D)
A document D is classified as relevant if P(R|D) > P(NR|D). Discarding the constant
P(D), this is equivalent to saying that a document is relevant if:

P(D|R) x P(R) > P(DINR) x P(NR)

The likelihood ratio P(D|R)/P(D|NR) is used as a score to determine the likelihood
of the document with representation D belonging to the relevant set.

The term independence or naive Bayes assumption is used to estimate P(D|R) using
computation of P(t|R) for term t;. The likelihood ratios P(D|R)/P(D|NR) of documents
are used as a proxy for ranking based on the assumption that highly ranked documents
will have a high likelihood of belonging to the relevant set.!?
