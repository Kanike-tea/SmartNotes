954 — Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop

Finally, we presented a general discussion of some issues related to MapReduce/Hadoop
technology. We briefly commented on the study done for this architecture vis-a-vis
parallel DBMSs. There are circumstances where one is superior over the other, and
claims about the superiority of parallel DBMSs for batch jobs are becoming less rele-
vant due to architectural advancements in the form of YARN-related developments.
We discussed the relationship between big data and cloud technologies and the work
being done to address data locality issues in cloud storage for big data analytics. We
stated that YARN is being considered as a generic data services platform, and we
listed the challenges for this technology as outlined in a paper authored by a group of
database experts. We concluded with a summary of ongoing projects in the field of
big data.
