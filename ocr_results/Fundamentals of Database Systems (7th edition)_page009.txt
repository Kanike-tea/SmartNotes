describes the basic relational model, its integrity constraints, and update
operations. Chapter 6 describes some of the basic parts of the SQL standard
for relational databases, including data definition, data modification opera-
tions, and simple SQL queries. Chapter 7 presents more complex SQL que-
ries, as well as the SQL concepts of triggers, assertions, views, and schema
modification. Chapter 8 describes the formal operations of the relational
algebra and introduces the relational calculus. The material on SQL (Chap-
ters 6 and 7) is presented before our presentation on relational algebra and
calculus in Chapter 8 to allow instructors to start SQL projects early in a
course if they wish (it is possible to cover Chapter 8 before Chapters 6 and 7
if the instructor desires this order). The final chapter in Part 2, Chapter 9,
covers ER- and EER-to-relational mapping, which are algorithms that can be
used for designing a relational database schema from a conceptual ER/EER
schema design.

Part 4 (Chapters 10 and 11) are the chapters on database programming tech-
niques; these chapters can be assigned as reading materials and augmented
with materials on the particular language used in the course for program-
ming projects (much of this documentation is readily available on the Web).
Chapter 10 covers traditional SQL programming topics, such as embedded
SQL, dynamic SQL, ODBC, SQLJ, JDBC, and SQL/CLI. Chapter 11 introduces
Web database programming, using the PHP scripting language in our exam-
ples, and includes new material that discusses Java technologies for Web
database programming.

Part 5 (Chapters 12 and 13) covers the updated material on object-relational
and object-oriented databases (Chapter 12) and XML (Chapter 13); both of
these chapters now include a presentation of how the SQL standard incorpo-
rates object concepts and XML concepts into more recent versions of the
SQL standard. Chapter 12 first introduces the concepts for object databases,
and then shows how they have been incorporated into the SQL standard in
order to add object capabilities to relational database systems. It then covers
the ODMG object model standard, and its object definition and query lan-
guages. Chapter 13 covers the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) model
and languages, and discusses how XML is related to database systems. It
presents XML concepts and languages, and compares the XML model to
traditional database models. We also show how data can be converted
between the XML and relational representations, and the SQL commands
for extracting XML documents from relational tables.

Part 6 (Chapters 14 and 15) are the normalization and relational design
theory chapters (we moved all the formal aspects of normalization algo-
rithms to Chapter 15). Chapter 14 defines functional dependencies, and
the normal forms that are based on functional dependencies. Chapter 14
also develops a step-by-step intuitive normalization approach, and includes
the definitions of multivalued dependencies and join dependencies.
Chapter 15 covers normalization theory, and the formalisms, theories,
