Figure 5.1
The attributes and tuples of a relation STUDENT.

The earlier definition of a relation can be restated more formally using set theory
concepts as follows. A relation (or relation state) r(R) is a mathematical relation of
degree n on the domains dom(A,), dom(A,), ... ,dom(A,,), which is a subset of the
Cartesian product (denoted by x) of the domains that define R:

r(R) C (dom(A,) x dom(A2) x... x (dom(A,,))

The Cartesian product specifies all possible combinations of values from the under-
lying domains. Hence, if we denote the total number of values, or cardinality, in a
domain D by |D| (assuming that all domains are finite), the total number of tuples
in the Cartesian product is

|dom(A))| x |dom(A3)| x... x |dom(A,,)]

This product of cardinalities of all domains represents the total number of possible
instances or tuples that can ever exist in any relation state r(R). Of all these possible
combinations, a relation state at a given time—the current relation state—reflects
only the valid tuples that represent a particular state of the real world. In general, as
the state of the real world changes, so does the relation state, by being transformed
into another relation state. However, the schema R is relatively static and changes
very infrequently—for example, as a result of adding an attribute to represent new
information that was not originally stored in the relation.

It is possible for several attributes to have the same domain. The attribute names indi-
cate different roles, or interpretations, for the domain. For example, in the STUDENT
relation, the same domain USA_phone_numbers plays the role of Home_phone, referring
to the home phone of a student, and the role of Office_phone, referring to the office
phone of the student. A third possible attribute (not shown) with the same domain
could be Mobile_phone.

5.1.2 Characteristics of Relations

The earlier definition of relations implies certain characteristics that make a rela-
tion different from a file or a table. We now discuss some of these characteristics.
