7. Define nucleic acid and elaborate the processes of
a) DNA vaccines for Rabies and
b) RNA vaccine for COVID 19

Ans. Nucleic acids are biopolymers that play a crucial role in the storage and transfer of genetic

information in all living organisms. There are two types of nucleic acids:

e Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): DNA is the genetic material that carries the instructions for the
development, functioning, and reproduction of all living organisms

e Ribonucleic acid (RNA): RNA is involved in the expression of the genetic information stored in
DNA by carrying the message from the DNA to the ribosome, where it is used to build proteins.

DNA Vaccine for Rabies

e A DNA vaccine for rabies is a type of vaccine that uses a piece of rabies virus DNA to stimulate
an immune response against the virus. The vaccine works by introducing the rabies virus DNA into
the body, where it is taken up by cells and used to produce viral proteins. These viral proteins are
then displayed on the surface of the cells, which triggers an immune response and the production

of antibodies against the rabies virus.
