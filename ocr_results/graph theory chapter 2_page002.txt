In the above drawing of Ks, the five edges e1, es, eg, €10, e4 form a pentagonal cycle (in
which the edges meet only at the vertices) and the remaining five edges Ci; C5; %, 7, &9 are alt
inside this cycle and intersect at points other than the vertices. Yamemmrime etn ©

Let us try to draw a diagram of Ks in which the edges meet only at the vertices. Let us start

our new drawing of Ks with the above - mentioned pentagonal cycle which is shown separately
in Figure 2.5(a).

Consider the edge e7 = {v2, vs}. This edge can be drawn either inside or outside the pen- _
tagonal cycle. Suppose we draw it inside, as shown in Figure 2.5(b) — the other case is similar.
Now, consider the edges €2 = {v1, v3} and ¢3 = (v1, v4). If we draw these edges also inside the

Pentagon, they will intersect ¢7; that is, they cross e7 at points which are not vertices. Therefore,

let us draw both of them outside; see Figure 2.5(b).

Next, consider the edge e6 = {v2, v4}. If we draw this edge out side the pentagon, it inter-
Sects the edge ey: see Figure 2.5(b)*. Therefore, let us draw eg inside the pentagon.
__ Lastly, consider the edge e9 = {v3,Vs}. If we draw this edge outside the pentagon, it
iMetsects the edge e3, and if we draw it inside, it intersects the edge e6.

é = :
When We say that two edges intersect we mean that the edges cross each other at a point which is not a vertex.
