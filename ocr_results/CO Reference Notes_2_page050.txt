© The Cache-memory stores a reasonable number of blocks at a given time.

© This number of blocks is small compared to the total number of blocks available in main-memory.

© Correspondence b/w main-memory-block & cache-memory-block is specified by mapping-function.
* Cache control hardware decides which block should be removed to create space for the new block.

© The collection of rule for making this decision is called the Replacement Algorithm.

© The cache control-circuit determines whether the requested-word currently exists in the cache.

© The write-operation is done in 2 ways: 1) Write-through protocol & 2) Write-back protocol.

Write-Through Protocol
» Here the cache-location and the main-memory-locations are updated simultaneously.
Write-Back Protocol
> This technique is to
— update only the cache-location &
— mark the cache-location with associated flag bit called Dirty/Modified Bit.
> The word in memory will be updated later, when the marked-block is removed from cache.
During Read-operation
« If the requested-word currently not exists in the cache, then read-miss will occur.
© To overcome the read miss, Load—through/Early restart protocol is used.
Load-Throu gh Protocol
> The block of words that contains the requested-word is copied from the memory into cache.
> After entire block is loaded into cache, the requested-word is forwarded to processor.
During Write-operation
« If the requested-word not exists in the cache, then write-miss will occur.
1) If Write Through Protocol is used, the information is written directly into main-memory.
2) If Write Back Protocol is used,
— then block containing the addressed word is first brought into the cache &
— then the desired word in the cache is over-written with the new information.

MAPPING-FUNCTION
© Here we discuss about 3 different mapping-function:
1) Direct Mapping
2) Associative Mapping
3) Set-Associative Mapping

DIRECT MAPPING

© The block-j of the main-memory maps onto block-j modulo-128 of the cache (Figure 8.16).
« When the memory-blocks 0, 128, & 256 are loaded into cache, the block is stored in cache-block 0.
Similarly, memory-blocks 1, 129, 257 are stored in cache-block 1.
¢ The contention may arise when
1) When the cache is full.
2) When more than one memory-block is mapped onto a given cache-block position.
© The contention is resolved by
allowing the new blocks to overwrite the currently resident-block.
* Memory-address determines placement of block in the cache.
