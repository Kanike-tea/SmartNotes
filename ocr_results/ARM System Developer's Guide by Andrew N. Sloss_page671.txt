D.6 ARM10E INSTRUCTION CYCLE TIMINGS

‘The ARM10E core is based on a five-stage pipeline with branch prediction. There is usually
a one-cycle delay following a load or multiply instruction before you can use the data. The
ARMIOE uses a 64-bit-wide data bus, so load and store instructions can transfer 64 bits
per cycle. The multiplier does not use early termination. Table D.10 gives the ARM10E
instruction cycle timings.

+1 if a register-specified shift, or RRX, is used.
+4 if Rd is pe.

‘An exception is MOV pc, Rn. This takes 4 cycles.
+4 if the branch is mispredicted.

+4 if the branch is mispredicted.

Data availability depends on the coprocessor.

Rais not available for one cycle.

+1 if the addressing mode is register preindexed with the option of a
(constant) shift.

+1 if the offset (pre- or postindex) is a shifted register.

(2 cycles if not executed].

Rdand R(d + 1) are not available for one cycle.

The first data item is not available for one cycle. Once the address is 8-byte
aligned, data items are loaded in pairs, at two per cycle. Therefore the kth
data item will be available after (k + a + 1)/2 cycles, where ais bit 2 of the
base address. You cannot start another load or store until this one has
finished.

L=(N + a)/2, and ais bit 2 of the base address.

Rais not available for one cycle.
+3 if any of the csx fields are updated.
[2 if the instruction is not executed.]

Rd is not available for one cycle.

RdHiis not available for one cycle.
