5.7 Transaction Support in SQL

= The basic definition of an SQL transaction is, it is a logical unit of work and is guaranteed
to be atomic

=A single SQL statement is always considered to be atomic—either it completes
execution without an error or it fails and leaves the database unchanged

= With SQbk, there is no explicit Begin_Transaction statement. Transaction initiation is
done implicitly when particular SQL statements are encountered

= Every transaction must have an explicit end statement, which is either a COMMIT or a
ROLLBACK

= Every transaction has certain characteristics attributed to it and are specified by a SET
TRANSACTION statement in SQL
