A Hamiltonian cycle is a graph that has a cycle containg all the vertices in
the graph.

An example of a graph containing a Hamiltonian path but not a
Hamiltonian cycle is a path of any order.

Simple Digraphs: A digraph that has no self-loop or parallel edges is called a
simple digraph (Figs. 9-2 and 9-3, for example).

Asymmetric Digraphs: Digraphs that have at most one directed edge between
a pair of vertices, but are allowed to have self-loops, are called asymmetric or
antisymmetric.

Symmetric Digraphs: Digraphs in which for every edge (a, b) (i.e., from
vertex a to b) there is also an edge (b, a).

A digraph that is both simple and symmetric is called a simple symmetric
digraph. Similarly, a digraph that is both simple and asymmetric is simple

asymmetric. The reason for the terms symmetric and asymmetric will be
apparent in the context of binary relations in Section 9-3.

Complete Digraphs: A complete undirected graph was defined as a simple
graph in which every vertex is joined to every other vertex exactly by one edge.
For digraphs we have two types of complete graphs. A complete symmetric
digraph is a simple digraph in which there is exactly one edge directed from
every vertex to every other vertex (Fig. 9-3), and a complete asymmetric digraph
is an asymmetric digraph in which there is exactly one edge between every pair
of vertices (Fig. 9-2).

A complete asymmetric digraph of n vertices contains n(n — 1)/2 edges, but a
complete symmetric digraph of n vertices contains n(n — 1) edges. A complete
asymmetric digraph is also called a tournament or a complete tournament (the
reason for this term will be made clear in Section 9-10).

A digraph is said to be balanced if for every vertex v; the in-degree equals the
out-degree; that is, d *(v)) = d (vj). (A balanced digraph is also referred to as a
pseudosymmetric digraph, or an isograph.) A balanced digraph is said to be
regular if every vertex has the same in-degree and out-degree as every other
vertex.
