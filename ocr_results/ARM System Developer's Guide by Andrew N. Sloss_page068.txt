3.1.4 USING THE BARREL SHIFTER WITH ARITHMETIC
INSTRUCTIONS

‘The wide range of second operand shifts available on arithmetic and logical instructions
is a very powerful feature of the ARM instruction set. Example 3.7 illustrates the use of
the inline barrel shifter with an arithmetic instruction. The instruction multiplies the value
stored in register r] by three.

ExAMPLE Register rJ is first shifted one location to the left to give the value of twice rl. The ADD
3.7 _ instruction then adds the result of the barrel shift operation to register rl. The final result
transferred into register r0 is equal to three times the value stored in register rl.

PRE r0 = 0x00000000
r1 = 0x00000005

r1 = 0x00000005

3.1.5 LOGICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Logical instructions perform bitwise logical operations on the two source registers.

Syntax: <instruction>{<cond>}{$} Rd, Rn, N

AND logical bitwise AND of two 32-bit values Rd = Rn&N
ORR logical bitwise OR of two 32-bit values Rd = Rn|N
EOR logical exclusive OR of two 32-bit values Rd = Rn“ N
BIC logical bit clear (AND NOT) Rd = Rn& ~N

EXAMPLE This example shows a logical OR operation between registers r] and r2. r0 holds the result.
PRE r0 = 0x00000000
r1 = 0x02040608
r2 = 0x10305070
