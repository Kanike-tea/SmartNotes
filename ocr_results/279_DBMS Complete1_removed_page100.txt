Problems due to locking

1) deadlock
2) starvation

Deadlock:

It is an indefinite wait situation in which a series of transactions wait for each other for unknown
amount of time, it obeys the following conditions:

Hold & Wait

>No Preemption

> Mutual Exclusion

Circular Wait

Example:

For example, assume a set of transactions {To, Ti, T2, ...,Tn}. To needs a resource X to complete its
task. Resource X is held by Ti, and T) is waiting for a resource Y, which is held by T2. T2 is waiting
for resource Z, which is held by To. Thus, all the processes wait for each other to release resources.
In this situation, none of the processes can finish their task. This situation is known as a deadlock.

Starvation:

It is a situation in which a transaction has locked a database for unfair means & all other
transactions are in indefinite waiting.

Starvation Deadlock
Starvation happens if same transaction is A deadlock is a condition in which two or more transaction
always chosen as victim. is waiting for each other.

It occurs if the waiting scheme for locked/A situation where two or more transactions are unable to
items in unfair, giving priority to some proceed because each is waiting for one of the other to do

transactions over others. something.

Starvation is also known as lived lock. Deadlock is also known as circular waiting.
