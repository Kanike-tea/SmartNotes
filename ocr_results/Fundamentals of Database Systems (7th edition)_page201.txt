violated by each operation, if any, and the different ways of enforcing
these constraints.

a. Insert <‘Robert’, ‘P, ‘Scott’, 943775543’, ‘1972-06-21’, ‘2365 Newcastle
Rd, Bellaire, TX’, M, 58000, ‘888665555’, 1> into EMPLOYEE.

. Insert <ProductA’, 4, ‘Bellaire’, 2> into PROJECT.

. Insert <‘Production’, 4, ‘943775543’, ‘2007-10-01’> into DEPARTMENT.

. Insert <“677678989’, NULL, ‘40.0’> into WORKS_ON.

. Insert <“453453453’, John’, ‘M’, ‘1990-12-12’, ‘spouse’> into DEPENDENT.
Delete the WORKS_ON tuples with Essn = “333445555”.

. Delete the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = ‘987654321’.

. Delete the PROJECT tuple with Pname = ‘ProductX’.

i. Modify the Mgr_ssn and Mgr_start_date of the DEPARTMENT tuple with
Dnumber = 5 to ‘123456789’ and ‘2007-10-01’, respectively.

j. Modify the Super_ssn attribute of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn =
“999887777 to 943775543".

k. Modify the Hours attribute of the WORKS_ON tuple with Essn =
“999887777 and Pno = 10 to ‘5.0’.

Consider the AIRLINE relational database schema shown in Figure 5.8,
which describes a database for airline flight information. Each FLIGHT is
identified by a Flight_number, and consists of one or more FLIGHT_LEGs
with Leg_numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each FLIGHT_LEG has scheduled
arrival and departure times, airports, and one or more LEG_INSTANCEs—
one for each Date on which the flight travels. FAREs are kept for each
FLIGHT. For each FLIGHT_LEG instance, SEAT_RESERVATIONs are kept, as
are the AIRPLANE used on the leg and the actual arrival and departure times
and airports. An AIRPLANE is identified by an Airplane_id and is of a particu-
Jar AIRPLANE_TYPE. CAN_LAND relates AIRPLANE_TYPEs to the AIRPORTs
at which they can land. An AIRPORT is identified by an Airport_code. Con-
sider an update for the AIRLINE database to enter a reservation on a particu-
lar flight or flight leg on a given date.

a. Give the operations for this update.

b. What types of constraints would you expect to check?

c. Which of these constraints are key, entity integrity, and referential integ-
rity constraints, and which are not?

d. Specify all the referential integrity constraints that hold on the schema
shown in Figure 5.8.

Consider the relation CLASS(Course#, Univ_Section#, Instructor_name,
Semester, Building_code, Room#, Time_period, Weekdays, Credit_hours). This rep-
resents classes taught in a university, with unique Univ_section#s. Identify what
you think should be various candidate keys, and write in your own words the
conditions or assumptions under which each candidate key would be valid.
