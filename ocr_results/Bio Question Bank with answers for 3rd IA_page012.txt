Becker muscular dystrophy typically becomes apparent between the ages of 5 and 15. It is
similar to Duchenne MD, except that it progresses slower and symptoms begin to appear later.
Boys are primarily affected by Becker MD. Becker MD causes muscle loss that begins in the
hips and pelvic area, thighs, and shoulders.

Bioengineering solutions for muscular dystrophy

Bioengineering solutions for muscular dystrophy aim to improve the lives of individuals
affected by the disease by addressing the underlying genetic mutations and muscle weakness.
Some of the approaches being explored include:

: Gene therapy: This involves delivering a functional copy of the missing or mutated
gene to the affected muscle cells. The goal is to restore the production of the missing protein
and improve muscle function.

: Stem cell therapy: This involves using stem cells to replace the damaged muscle cells
and promote repair and regeneration of the muscle tissue. Stem cells can be taken from the
patient's own body (autologous stem cells) or from a donor (allogenic stem cells).

: Exoskeleton technology: This involves using wearable devices, such as robotic
exoskeletons, to support and enhance the movement of individuals with muscular dystrophy.
The devices use motors and sensors to mimic the movements of the wearer and help improve
mobility.

. Tissue engineering: This involves using a combination of materials, such as scaffolds
and growth factors, to promote the growth and repair of muscle tissue. The goal is to create
functional muscle tissue that can replace the damaged tissue in individuals with muscular
dystrophy.

10. Explain the architecture of muscular & skeletal system as Scaffolds.

Ans. The muscular and skeletal systems of the human body form a complex and well-organized
natural scaffold that provides structural support, movement, protection, and integration for
tissues and organs. In the context of biomedical engineering and tissue engineering, these
systems serve as biological blueprints or inspiration for designing artificial scaffolds used in
regeneration and repair.

Skeletal System as a Scaffold

The skeletal system consists of bones that act as the primary load-bearing and structural
components of the body. Bones are rigid but dynamic structures that not only provide shape
and support but also house bone marrow and serve as anchoring points for muscles.

Key architectural features of bones as scaffolds:

Porosity: Bones are not solid; they contain microscopic pores that allow the exchange of
nutrients and waste, and support vascularization.
