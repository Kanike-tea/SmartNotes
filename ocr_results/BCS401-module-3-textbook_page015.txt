Sorting by Counting

As a first example of applying the input-enhancement technique, we discuss its
application to the sorting problem. One rather obvious idea is to count, for each
element of a list to be sorted, the total number of elements smaller than this
element and record the results in a table. These numbers will indicate the positions
of the elements in the sorted list: e.g., if the count is 10 for some element, it should
be in the 11th position (with index 10, if we start counting with 0) in the sorted
array. Thus, we will be able to sort the list by simply copying its elements to their
appropriate positions in a new, sorted list. This algorithm is called comparison-
counting sort (Figure 7.1).
