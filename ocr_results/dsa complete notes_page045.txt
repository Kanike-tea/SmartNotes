Queues:
A queue is an ordered list in which insertions and deletions take place at different ends. The end at

which new elements are added is called the rear, and that from which old elements are deleted is called
the front. Queues are also known as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) lists.

The ADT specification of the queue
objects: a finite ordered list with zero or more elements.

functions: for all queue€Queue, iteme€element, maxQueueSize€ positive integer

Queue CreateQ(maxQueueSize) ::= create an empty queue whose maximum size is
maxQueueSize
BooleanIsFullQ(queue, if (number of elements in queue == maxQueueSize)
maxQueueSize) ::= returnTRUE
else returnFALSE

QueueAddQ(queue, item) :: if (IsFullQ(queue)) queueFull

else insert item at rear of queue and return queue

BooleanIsEmptyQ(queue) ::

if (queue == CreateQ(maxQueueSize))
returnTRUE
else return FALSE

Element DeleteQ(queue) ::= if (IsEmptyQ(queue)) return

else remove and return the item at front of queue.
