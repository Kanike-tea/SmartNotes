Database Management System [BCS403]

If the value of the lock on X is 0, the item can be accessed when

requested, and the lock value is changed to 1

= Werefer to the current value (or state) of the lock associated with item X
as lock(X).

= Two operations, lock_item and unlock_item, are used with binary
locking.

= A transaction requests access to an item X by first issuing a lock_item(X)
operation

= If LOCK(X) = 1, the transaction is forced to wait.

= If LOCK(X) = 0, it is set to 1 (the transaction locks the item) and the
transaction is allowed to access item X

= When the transaction is through using the item, it issues an
unlock_item(X) operation, which sets LOCK(X) back to 0 (unlocks the
item) so that X may be accessed by other transactions

= Hence, a binary lock enforces mutual exclusion on the data item.

lock_item(X):
B: if LOCK(X) = 0 (* item is unlocked *)
then LOCK(X) <1 (* lock the item *)
else
begin
wait (until LOCK(X) = 0
and the lock manager wakes up the transaction);
go toB

end;

unlock_item(X):

LOCK(X) <— 0; (* unlock the item *)

if any transactions are waiting

then wakeup one of the waiting transactions;
