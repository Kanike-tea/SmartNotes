specific grade in that section. In this document hierarchy, a student taking more
than one section will have several replicas, one under each section, and each replica
will have the specific grade given in that particular section.

In the second hierarchical document view, we can choose STUDENT as root (Fig-
ure 13.12). In this hierarchical view, each student has a set of sections as its child
elements, and each section is related to one course as its child, because the rela-
tionship between SECTION and COURSE is N:1. Thus, we can merge the COURSE
and SECTION elements in this view, as shown in Figure 13.12. In addition, the
GRADE database attribute can be migrated to the SECTION element. In this hier-
archy, the combined COURSE/SECTION information is replicated under each stu-
dent who completed the section. A possible simplified XML schema for this view
is shown in Figure 13.13.

The third possible way is to choose SECTION as the root, as shown in Figure 13.14.
Similar to the second hierarchical view, the COURSE information can be merged
into the SECTION element. The GRADE database attribute can be migrated to the
