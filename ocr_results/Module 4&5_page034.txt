A cache memory must also store the data read from main memory. This information is held in

the data section.

The size of a cache is defined as the actual code or data the cache can store from main memory.

Not included in the cache size is the cache memory required to support cache-tags or status bits.

There are also status bits in cache memory to maintain state information. Two common status
bits are the valid bit and dirty bit. A valid bit marks a cache line as active, meaning it contains
live data originally taken from main memory and is currently available to the processor core on
demand. A dirty bit defines whether or not a cache line contains data that is different from the

value it represents in main memory.
2.3. The Relationship between Cache and Main Memory

Figure 5 shows where portions of main memory are temporarily stored in cache memory. The

figure represents the simplest form of cache, known as a direct-mapped cache.

In a direct-mapped cache each addressed location in main memory maps to a single location in

cache memory. Since main memory is much larger than cache memory, there are many addresses
