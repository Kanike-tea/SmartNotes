DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 2

Implementation of the delete operation

element pop(int i)
{ /* remove top element from the ith stack */ if
(top[i] == boundary[i])
return stackEmpty(i);
return memory([top[i]--];

}

The top[i] == boundary[i+1] condition in push implies only that a particular stack ran out of
memory, not that the entire memory is full. But still there may be a lot of unused space
between other stacks in array memory as shown in Figure.

Therefore, create an error recovery function called stackFull , which determines if there is any
free space in memory. If there is space available, it should shift the stacks so that space is

allocated to the full stack.
