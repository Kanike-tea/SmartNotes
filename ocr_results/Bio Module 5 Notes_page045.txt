Energy efficiency: Bio-computing systems are energy-efficient, which is becoming
increasingly important as we face the challenge of climate change and the need to reduce our
energy consumption.

Robustness: Bio-computing systems are highly robust, as they are less susceptible to errors
and failures compared to traditional electronic systems.

Versatility: Bio-computing systems can be programmed and reprogrammed to perform
different tasks, which makes them highly versatile and adaptable.

Advantages of Bio-computing:

Biocompatibility: Bio-computing systems are made from biological components, which are
biocompatible and less likely to cause an immune response compared to traditional
electronic devices.

Energy efficiency: Bio-computing systems use significantly less energy than traditional
electronic computers, as they rely on biological processes that occur naturally and do not
require external power.

Scalability: Bio-computing systems can be easily scaled up or down, as they are based on
biological processes that can be repeated and multiplied.

Robustness: Bio-computing systems are often more robust and reliable than traditional
electronic systems, as they are less susceptible to errors and failures.

Flexibility: Bio-computing systems can be programmed and reprogrammed to perform
different tasks, which makes them highly flexible and adaptable.

Limitations of Biocomputing:

Speed: Bio-computing systems are generally slower than traditional electronic computers, as
they rely on biological processes that occur over time.

Complexity: Bio-computing systems can be complex and challenging to design and build,
requiring specialized knowledge and expertise.

Reliability: Bio-computing systems can be unreliable, as they are subject to the fluctuations
and errors inherent in biological systems.

Cost: Bio-computing systems can be expensive to produce, as they require specialized
materials and equipment.

Bio-imaging for Disease Diagnosis

Bio-imaging is the use of imaging technologies to visualize biological processes and

structures in living organisms. It plays a crucial role in disease diagnosis by providing detailed
