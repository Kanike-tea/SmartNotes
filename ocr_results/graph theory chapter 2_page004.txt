This demonstrates that in every possible plane drawing of K33, at least two edges of K33
intersect at a point which is not a vertex of K3,3.
This proves that K3,3 is a non-planar graph. cy

Note: The non-planarity of Ks and K3,3 will be proved in an alternative way in Section 2.2.

DET Suppose there are three houses and three utility points (electricity, water, sewer-
age, say) which are such that each utility point is joined to each house: Can the lines of joining
be such that no two lines cross each other?"

4 Consider the graph in which the vertices are the three houses (1, 2, h3) and the three utility
OAs (us, rp, u3). Since each house is joined to each utility point, the graph has to be K3,3 (See
ea 2.8). This graph is non-planar and therefore, in its every plané ‘drawing, at least two of

8S cross each other. As such, it is not possible to have the lines joining the houses and

* utility points such that no two lines cross each other. s
