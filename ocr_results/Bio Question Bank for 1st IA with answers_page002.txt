Prokaryotic Cells

Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus. Instead, some prokaryotes such as bacteria have
a region within the cell where the genetic material is freely suspended. This region

is called the nucleoid.

They all are single-celled microorganisms. Examples include archaea, bacteria,

and cyanobacteria.
The cell size ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 wm in diameter.
The hereditary material can either be DNA or RNA.

Prokaryotes generally reproduce by binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction.

They are also known to use conjugation — which is often seen as the prokaryotic

equivalent to sexual reproduction (however, it is NOT sexual reproduction).

Eukaryotic Cells

Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a true nucleus.
The size of the cells ranges between 10—100 ym in diameter.
This broad category involves plants, fungi, protozoans, and animals.

The plasma membrane is responsible for monitoring the transport of nutrients and
electrolyte in and out of the cells. It is also responsible for cell-to-cell

communication.

They reproduce sexually as well as asexually.
