1054 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

example, an intelligent agent retrieves product information from a variety of
vendor sites using only general information about the product domain.

= Information filtering/categorization is another technique that utilizes
Web agents for categorizing Web documents. These Web agents use meth-
ods from information retrieval, as well as semantic information based on
the links among various documents, to organize documents into a concept
hierarchy.

= Personalized Web agents are another type of Web agents that utilize the
personal preferences of users to organize search results, or to discover infor-
mation and documents that could be of value for a particular user. User
preferences could be learned from previous user choices, or from other indi-
viduals who are considered to have similar preferences to the user.

The database-based approach aims to infer the structure of the Web site or to
transform a Web site to organize it as a database so that better information man-
agement and querying on the Web become possible. This approach of Web con-
tent analysis primarily tries to model the data on the Web and integrate it so that
more sophisticated queries than keyword-based search can be performed. These
could be achieved by finding the schema of Web documents or building a Web
document warehouse, a Web knowledge base, or a virtual database. The database-
based approach may use a model such as the Object Exchange Model (OEM),*!
which represents semistructured data by a labeled graph. The data in the OEM is
viewed as a graph, with objects as the vertices and labels on the edges. Each object
is identified by an object identifier and a value that is either atomic—such as inte-
ger, string, GIF image, or HTML document—or complex in the form of a set of
object references.

The main focus of the database-based approach has been with the use of multilevel
databases and Web query systems. A multilevel database at its lowest level is a
database containing primitive semistructured information stored in various Web
repositories, such as hypertext documents. At the higher levels, metadata or gener-
alizations are extracted from lower levels and organized in structured collections
such as relational or object-oriented databases. In a Web query system, informa-
tion about the content and structure of Web documents is extracted and organized
using database-like techniques. Query languages similar to SQL can then be used to
search and query Web documents. These types of queries combine structural que-
ries, based on the organization of hypertext documents, and content-based queries.

27.7.6 Web Usage Analysis

Web usage analysis is the application of data analysis techniques to discover usage
patterns from Web data, in order to understand and better serve the needs of Web-
based applications. This activity does not directly contribute to information
retrieval; but it is important for improving and enhancing users’ search experiences.
