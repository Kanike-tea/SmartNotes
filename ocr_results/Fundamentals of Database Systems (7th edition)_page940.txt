What are the similarities and differences between using consistency in CAP
versus using consistency in ACID?

What are the data modeling concepts used in MongoDB? What are the main
CRUD operations of MongoDB?

Discuss how replication and sharding are done in MongoDB.
Discuss the data modeling concepts in DynamoDB.

Describe the consistent hashing schema for data distribution, replication,
and sharding. How are consistency and versioning handled in Voldemort?

What are the data modeling concepts used in column-based NOSQL sys-
tems and Hbase?

What are the main CRUD operations in Hbase?
Discuss the storage and distributed system methods used in Hbase.

What are the data modeling concepts used in the graph-oriented NOSQL
system Neo4j?

Discuss the interfaces and distributed systems characteristics of Neo4j.

Selected Bibliography

The original paper that described the Google BigTable distributed storage system
is Chang et al. (2006), and the original paper that described the Amazon Dynamo
key-value store system is DeCandia et al. (2007). There are numerous papers that
compare various NOSQL systems with SQI (relational systems); for example,
Parker et al. (2013). Other papers compare NOSQL systems to other NOSQL sys-
tems; for example Cattell (2010), Hecht and Jablonski (2011), and Abramova and
Bernardino (2013).

The documentation, user manuals, and tutorials for many NOSQL systems can be
found on the Web. Here are a few examples:

MongoDB tutorials: docs. mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/

MongoDB manual: docs.mongodb.org/manual/

Voldemort documentation: docs.project-voldemort.com/voldemort/

Cassandra Web site: cassandra.apache.org

Hbase Web site: hbase.apache.org

Neo4j documentation: neo4j.com/docs/

In addition, numerous Web sites categorize NOSQL systems into additional sub-
categories based on purpose; nosql-database.org is one example of such a site.
