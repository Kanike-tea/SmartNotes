VIVAQUESTIONSANDANSWERS
1) Whatisdatastructure?
Data structures refer to the way data is organized and manipulated. It seeks to find ways to make data
accessmore efficient. When dealing with data structure, we not only focus on one piece of data, but rather
differentsetof data and how theycan relate tooneanotherin an organized manner.
2) Differentiatefilestructurefromstoragestructure.
Basically, the key difference is the memory area that is being accessed. When dealing with the structure
thatresides the main memory of the computer system, this is referred to as storage structure. When dealing
withanauxiliarystructure, we refer to it as file structures.
3) Whenisabinarysearchbestapplied?
A binary search is an algorithm that is best applied to search a list when the elements are already in order
orsorted. The list is search starting in the middle, such that if that middle value is not the target search key,
itwill check to see if it will continue the search on the lower half of the list or the higher half. The split
andsearchwill then continuein thesamemanner.
4) Whatis alinked list?
A linked list is a sequence of nodes in which each node is connected to the node following it. This forms
achain-likelink ofdata storage.
5) How doyoureferencealltheelementsinaone-dimension array?
To do this, an indexed loop is used, such that the counter runs from O to the array size minus one. In

6) Inwhatareasdodatastructuresapplied?
Data structures is important in almost every aspect where data is involved. In general, algorithms that
involveefficient data structure is applied in the following areas: numerical analysis, operating system, A.I.,
compilerdesign databasemanagement, graphics, andstatisticalanalysis, to nameafew.
7) WhatisLIFO?
LIFO is short for Last in First Out, and refers to how data is accessed, stored and retrieved. Usingthisscheme,
data that was stored last, should be the one to be extracted first. This also means that in order to gainaccess to
the first data, all the other data that was stored before this first data must first be retrieved andextracted.
8) Whatis a queue?
A queue is a data structure that can simulates a list or stream of data. In this structure, new elements
areinsertedat oneend and existingelements areremoved from the otherend.
9) Whatarebinary trees?
A binary tree is one type of data structure that has two nodes, a left node and a right node. In
programming, binarytreesare actuallyan extension of thelinked list structures.
