29.3 Data Modeling for Data Warehouses

Other terms frequently encountered in the context of data warehousing are
as follows:

= Operational data store (ODS): This term is commonly used for intermedi-
ate form of databases before they are cleansed, aggregated, and transformed
into a data warehouse.

= Analytical data store (ADS): Those are the database that are built for the
purpose of conducting data analysis. Typically, ODSs are reconfigured and
repurposed into ADSs through the processes of cleansing, aggregation, and
transformation.

29.3 Data Modeling for Data Warehouses

Multidimensional models take advantage of inherent relationships in data to popu-
late data in multidimensional matrices called data cubes. (These may be called hyper-
cubes if they have more than three dimensions.) For data that lends itself to
multidimensional modeling, query performance in multidimensional matrices can
be much better than in the relational data model. Three examples of dimensions in a
corporate data warehouse are the corporation’s fiscal periods, products, and regions.

A standard spreadsheet is a two-dimensional matrix. One example would be a
spreadsheet of regional sales by product for a particular time period. Products could
be shown as rows, with columns comprising sales revenues for each region. (Fig-
ure 29.2 shows this two-dimensional organization.) Adding a time dimension, such
as an organization’s fiscal quarters, would produce a three-dimensional matrix,
which could be represented using a data cube.

Figure 29.3 shows a three-dimensional data cube that organizes product sales data by
fiscal quarters and sales regions. Each cell could contain data for a specific product,
