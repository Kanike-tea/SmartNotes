Physical address in main memory
Figure 8.26 Use of an associative-mapped TLB.

* When OS changes contents of page-table, the control-bit will invalidate corresponding entry inTLB.
© Given a virtual-address, the MMU looks in TLB for the referenced-page.
If page-table entry for this page is found in TLB, the physical-address is obtained immediately.
Otherwise, the required entry is obtained from the page-table & TLB is updated.

Page Faults

© Page-fault occurs when a program generates an access request to a page that is not in memory.
¢ When MMU detects a page-fault, the MMU asks the OS to generate an interrupt.
¢ The OS
— suspends the execution of the task that caused the page-fault and
— begins execution of another task whose pages are in memory.
© When the task resumes the interrupted instruction must continue from the point of interruption.
¢ If anew page is brought from disk when memory is full, disk must replace one of the resident pages. In
this case, LRU algorithm is used to remove the least referenced page from memory.
« A modified page has to be written back to the disk before it is removed from the memory. In
this case, Write-Through Protocol is used.

Problem 1:
Consider a main-memory built with SDRAM chips. Data are transferred in bursts & the burst length is
8. Assume that 32 bits of data are transferred in parallel. If a 400-MHz clock is used, how much time does
it take to transfer:
(a) 32 bytes of data
(b) 64 bytes of data
What is the latency in each case?
Solution:
(a) It takes 5 + 8 = 13 clock cycles.
