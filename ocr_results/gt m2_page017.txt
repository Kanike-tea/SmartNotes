Fig. 9-2 Two nonisomorphic digraphs.

Isomorphic Digraphs: Isomorphic graphs were defined such that they have
identical behavior in terms of graph properties. In other words, if their labels are
removed, two isomorphic graphs are indistinguishable. For two digraphs to be
isomorphic not only must their corresponding undirected graphs be isomorphic,
but the directions of the corresponding edges must also agree. For example, Fig.
9-2 shows two digraphs that are not isomorphic, although they are orientations
of the same undirected graph.

Figure 9-2 immediately suggests a problem. What is the number of distinct
(i.e., nonisomorphic) orientations of a given undirected graph? The problem was
solved by F. Harary and E. M. Palmer in 1966. Some specific cases are left as an
exercise (Problem 9-3).

9-2. SOME TYPES OF DIGRAPHS

Like their undirected sisters, digraphs come in many varieties. In fact, due to
the choice of assigning a direction to each edge, directed graphs have more
varieties than undirected ones.

Simple Digraphs: A digraph that has no self-loop or parallel edges is called a
simple digraph (Figs. 9-2 and 9-3, for example).

Asymmetric Digraphs: Digraphs that have at most one directed edge between
a pair of vertices, but are allowed to have self-loops, are called asymmetric or
antisymmetric.

Symmetric Digraphs: Digraphs in which for every edge (a, b) (ie., from
vertex a to b) there is also an edge (b, a).

A digraph that is both simple and symmetric is called a simple symmetric
digraph. Similarly, a digraph that is both simple and asymmetric is simple
