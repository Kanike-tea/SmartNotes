Student's ¢ Distribution

Sir william Gosset under the pen name ‘Student’ derived a'theoretical distribution-to
test the significance of'a sample mean where the small sample is drawn froma normal
population. : ‘ ‘,

Let x,(i=1, 2, --:n) bea random sample’ of size n drawn from a normal ,
population with mean ‘1 and variance o. The statistic t is defined as follows. .
