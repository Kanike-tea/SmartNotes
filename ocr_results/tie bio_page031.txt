7. Explain Electrical nose and tongue in detail.
Answer:

E-nose has a series of sensors that correspond to components of an odor and analyzes its
chemical makeup to identify it. They are much more sensitive than human noses as they have
a greater number of receptor sensors with higher sensitivity.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Using a sensor array (an electronic chip) and onboard pattern recognition algorithms, the
lightweight, portable device works by exposing an array of plastic composite sensors to the
chemical components in a vapor.

When the sensors come in contact with the vapor, the polymer expands like a sponge,
changing the resistance of the composites.

The change in resistance is measured, and from that measurement, the presence of a pre-
trained substance is determined with a quick and accurate diagnosis.

Electronic noses include three major parts:

1.A sample delivery system- Many of the devices use Artificial Intelligence to evaluate the
signal from the Detection System and put it through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
that simulates how the human brain works.

2.4 detection system - The adsorption of volatile compounds on the sensor surface causes
a physical change of the sensor.

3. A computing system — To analyze information from the detection system and
provide pattern recognition output that describes the odor or aroma.
