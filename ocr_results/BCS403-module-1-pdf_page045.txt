Example of a M:N binary relationship

e = The relationship type WORKS_ON is of cardinality ratio M:N, because the mini-world rule is that
an employee can work on several projects and a project can have several employees.
= Cardinality ratios for binary relationships are represented on ER diagrams by displaying 1, M, and N

on the diamonds

Participation Constraints and Existence Dependencies

@@iStfaiaT here are two types of participation constraints:

+ Total
+ Partial

Total participation

Ifa company policy states that every employee must work for a department, then an employee entity can
exist only if it participates in at least one WORKS_FOR relationship Instance. Thus, the participation of
EMPLOYEE in WORKS FOR is called total participation, meaning that every entity in the total set of
employee entities must be related to a department entity via WORKS_FOR. Total participation is also

called existence dependency
