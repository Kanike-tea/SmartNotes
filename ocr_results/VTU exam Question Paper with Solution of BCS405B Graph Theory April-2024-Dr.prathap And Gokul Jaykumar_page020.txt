The proper coloring which is of interest to us is one that requires the minimum
number of colors. A graph G that requires x different colors for its proper
coloring, and no less, is called a k-chromatic graph, and the number x is called

the chromatic number of G. You can verify that the graph in Fig. 8-1 is 3-
chromatic.

b)

Proof: Let G be a connected graph with circuits of only even lengths.
Consider a spanning tree T in G. Using the coloring procedure and the result of
Theorem 8-1, let us properly color T with two colors. Now add the chords to T
one by one. Since G had no circuits of odd length, the end vertices of every
chord being replaced are differently colored in T. Thus G is colored with two
colors, with no adjacent vertices having the same color. That is, G is 2-
chromatic.

Conversely, if G has a circuit of odd length, we would need at least three
colors just for that circuit (observation 4 in this section). Thus the theorem. m

In general, a given graph G of n vertices can be properly colored in many
different ways using a sufficiently large number of colors. This property of a
graph is expressed elegantly by means of a polynomial. This polynomial is
called the chromatic polynomial of G and is defined as follows :

The value of the chromatic polynomial P,(A) of a graph with n vertices gives
the number of ways of properly coloring the graph, using A or fewer colors.

Let c; be the different ways of properly coloring G using exactly i different
colors. Since i colors can be chosen out of A colors in

a
( ') different ways,

there are <(') different ways of properly coloring G using exactly i colors out of A
colors.

Since i can be any positive integer from 1 to n (it is not possible to use more
than n colors on n vertices), the chromatic polynomial is a sum of these terms;
