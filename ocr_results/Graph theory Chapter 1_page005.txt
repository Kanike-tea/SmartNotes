» The given digraph has 7 vertices and 12 directed edges. The out-degree of a vertex is got
by counting the number of edges that go out of the vertex and the in-degree of a vertex is got
by counting the number of edges that end at the vertex. Thus, we obtain the following data:

Vertex: vy va v3 v4 V5 v6 v7
Out-degree: [4 [2,2 113 Po 0
Indegree: [00 PIP a | 2) tear toe
This table gives the out-degrees and in-degrees of all vertices. We note that v; is a source
and v¢ and v7 are sinks.

We also check that

Sum of out-degrees = sum of in-degrees = 12 = No. of edges.

| Example 2] Let D be a digraph with an odd number

odd out-degre,

of vertices. If each vertex of D has an

rtices with odd in-degrees.
> Let vy, v2,...,¥n be the n vertices of D, where n is odd. Also, let m be the number of edges
in D. Then, we have

and (V1) + dy gees £2) =n (i)

If each vertex has odd out-degree, then the left hand side of (i) is a sum of n odd numbers:
Since n is odd, this sum must also be odd, Thus, m is odd,
