Sequential patterns: Data is mined to anticipate behavior patterns and trends. For example,
an outdoor equipment retailer could predict the likelihood of a backpack being purchased
based on a consumer's purchase of sleeping bags and hiking shoes.

Data mining consists of five major elements:

Extract, transform, and load transaction data onto the data warehouse system.
Store and manage the data in a multidimensional database system.

Provide data access to business analysts and information technology professionals.
Analyze the data by application software.

Present the data in a useful format, such as a graph or table.

Techniques used in data mining:

Association

Association is one of the best-known data mining technique. In association, a pattern is
discovered based on a relationship between items in the same transaction. That’s is the
reason why association technique is also known as relation technique. The association
technique is used in market basket analysis to identify a set of products that customers
frequently purchase together.

Retailers are using association technique to research customer’s buying habits. Based on
historical sale data, retailers might find out that customers always buy crisps when they buy
beers, and, therefore, they can put beers and crisps next to each other to save time for
customer and increase sales.

Classification

Classification is a classic data mining technique based on machine learning. Basically,
classification is used to classify each item in a set of data into one of a predefined set of
classes or groups. Classification method makes use of mathematical techniques such as
decision trees, linear programming, neural network and statistics. In classification, we
develop the software that can learn how to classify the data items into groups. For example,
we can apply classification in the application that “given all records of employees who left
the company, predict who will probably leave the company in a future period.” In this case,
we divide the records of employees into two groups that named “leave” and “stay”. And
then we can ask our data mining software to classify the employees into separate groups.

Clustering

Clustering is a data mining technique that makes a meaningful or useful cluster of objects
which have similar characteristics using the automatic technique. The clustering technique
defines the classes and puts objects in each class, while in the classification techniques,
objects are assigned into predefined classes. To make the concept clearer, we can take book
management in the library as an example. In a library, there is a wide range of books on
various topics available. The challenge is how to keep those books in a way that readers can
take several books on a particular topic without hassle. By using the clustering technique,
we can keep books that have some kinds of similarities in one cluster or one shelf and label
it with a meaningful name. If readers want to grab books in that topic, they would only have
to go to that shelf instead of looking for the entire library.
