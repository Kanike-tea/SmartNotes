Figure 9-3 Four-segment pipeline.

The space-time diagram of a four-segment pipeline is demonstrated in Fig. 9-4.
Where a k-segment pipeline with a clock cycle time t is used to execute n tasks.

o The first task Ti requires a time equal to kt, to complete its operation.

o The remaining n-1 tasks will be completed after a time equal to (n-1)tp

0 Therefore, to complete n tasks using a k-segment pipeline requires k+(n-1)clock cycles.
Consider a nonpipeline unit that performs the same operation and takes a time equalto ts to
complete each task.

o The total time required for n tasks is nts.

The speedup of a pipeline processing over an equivalent nonpipeline processing isdefined by the
ratio S=ntn/(k+n-1)t.

Ifn becomes much larger than k-1, the speedup becomes S = tn/tp.

If we assume that the time it takes to process a task is the same in the pipeline andnonpipeline
Circuits, i.e.,tn =ktp, the speedup reduces to S=ktp/tp=k.

This shows that the theoretical maximum speedup that a pipeline can provide is k,where k is the
number of segments in the pipeline.

To duplicate the theoretical speed advantage of a pipeline process by means of multiple
functional units, it is necessary to construct k identical units that will beoperating in parallel.
This is illustrated in Fig. 9-5, where four identical circuits are connected in parallel.

Instead of operating with the input data in sequence as in a pipeline, the parallel circuits accept
four input data items simultaneously and perform four tasks at thesame time.
