D latch

The D input goes directly to the S input, and its complement is applied to the R input. As long as the
enable input is at 0, the cross-coupled SR latch has both inputs at the | level and the circuit cannot
change state regardless of the value of D. The D input is sampled when En = 1. If D = 1, the Q output
goes to 1, placing the circuit in the set state. If D = 0, output Q goes to 0, placing the circuit in the reset
state.

The binary information present at the data input of the D latch is transferred to the Q output when the
enable input is asserted. The output follows changes in the data input as long as the enable input is
asserted. This situation provides a path from input D to the output, and for this reason, the circuit is often
called a transparent latch.

The graphic symbols for the various latches are shown in Fig. 5.7 . A latch is designated by a rectangular
block with inputs on the left and outputs on the right. One output designates the normal output, and the
other (with the bubble designation) designates the complement output. The graphic symbol for the SR
latch has inputs S and R indicated inside the block. In the case of a NAND gate latch, bubbles are added
to the inputs to indicate that setting and resetting occur with a logic-0 signal. The graphic symbol for the
D latch has inputs D and En indicated inside the block.

Storage Elements: Flip-Flops

The state of a latch or flip-flop is switched by a change in the control input. This momentary change is
called a trigger, and the transition it causes is said to trigger the flip-flop. The D latch with pulses in its
control input is essentially a flip-flop that is triggered every time the pulse goes to the logic-1 level.

As we know, a sequential circuit has a feedback path from the outputs of the flip-flops to the input of
the combinational circuit. Consequently, the inputs of the flip-flops are derived in part from the outputs
of the same and other flip-flops. When latches are used for the storage elements, a serious difficulty
arises. The state transitions of the latches start as soon as the clock pulse changes to the logic-1 level.
The new state of a latch appears at the output while the pulse is still active. This output is connected to
