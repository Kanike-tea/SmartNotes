Proof: Suppose a connected graph G is a tree. Then G has no cycles and there is Exactly one
path between any two vertices, u, v. If we add an edge between u and v, then an additiona} te
is created between u and v and the two paths constitute a cycle. Since G had no cycles cates
this is the only cycle which G now possesses. }
Conversely, suppose G is connected and adding an edge between any two vertices y and y
in G creates exactly one cycle in G. This implies that, before adding this edge, exactly one path
was there between u and v. This implies that G is a tree.

The proof of the theorem is complete. 7

Minimally connected graphs
connected graph is said to be minimally connected if the removal of any one edge from

it disconnects the graph. \ ‘

For example, the graphs shown in Figure 3.1 are minimally connected. As already noted,
all of these graphs are trees as well.

Theorem 6 . A connected graph is a tree if and only if it is minimally connected.

Proof: Suppose G is a connected graph which is not a tree. Then G contains a-cycle C. The
removal of any one edge e from this cycle will not make the graph disconnected. Therefore,
G is not minimally connected. Thus, if a connected graph is not a tree then itis not minimally
connected. This is equivalent to saying that if a connected graph is minimally connected then
it is a tree (contrapositive). :

Conversely, suppose G isa connected graph which is not minimally connected. Then there
exists an edge e in G such that G — e'is connected. Therefore, e must be in some cycle in G.
This implies that G is not a tree. Thus, if a connected graph is not minimally connected then it
is not a tree. This is equivalent to saying that if a connected graph is a tree, then it is minimally
connected (contrapositive).

This completes the proof of the theorem.
