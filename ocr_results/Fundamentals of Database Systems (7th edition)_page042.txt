Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

1.3.2 Insulation between Programs and Data,
and Data Abstraction

In traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in the applica-
tion programs, so any changes to the structure of a file may require changing all
programs that access that file. By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require
such changes in most cases. The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS cata-
log separately from the access programs. We call this property program-data
independence.

For example, a file access program may be written in such a way that it can access
only STUDENT records of the structure shown in Figure 1.4. If we want to add
another piece of data to each STUDENT record, say the Birth_date, such a program
will no longer work and must be changed. By contrast, ina DBMS environment, we
only need to change the description of STUDENT records in the catalog (Figure 1.3)
to reflect the inclusion of the new data item Birth_date; no programs are changed.
The next time a DBMS program refers to the catalog, the new structure of
STUDENT records will be accessed and used.

In some types of database systems, such as object-oriented and object-relational
systems (see Chapter 12), users can define operations on data as part of the database
definitions. An operation (also called a function or method) is specified in two
parts. The interface (or signature) of an operation includes the operation name and
the data types of its arguments (or parameters). The implementation (or method) of
the operation is specified separately and can be changed without affecting the inter-
face. User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these opera-
tions through their names and arguments, regardless of how the operations are
implemented. This may be termed program-operation independence.

The characteristic that allows program-data independence and program-operation
independence is called data abstraction. A DBMS provides users with a conceptual
representation of data that does not include many of the details of how the data is
stored or how the operations are implemented. Informally, a data model is a type of
data abstraction that is used to provide this conceptual representation. The data
model uses logical concepts, such as objects, their properties, and their interrela-
tionships, that may be easier for most users to understand than computer storage
concepts. Hence, the data model hides storage and implementation details that are
not of interest to most database users.

Looking at the example in Figures 1.2 and 1.3, the internal implementation of the
STUDENT file may be defined by its record length—the number of characters
(bytes) in each record—and each data item may be specified by its starting byte
within a record and its length in bytes. The STUDENT record would thus be repre-
sented as shown in Figure 1.4. But a typical database user is not concerned with the
location of each data item within a record or its length; rather, the user is concerned
that when a reference is made to Name of STUDENT, the correct value is returned.
A conceptual representation of the STUDENT records is shown in Figure 1.2. Many
other details of file storage organization—such as the access paths specified on a
