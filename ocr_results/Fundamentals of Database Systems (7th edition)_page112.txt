Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

3.7.2 Proper Naming of Schema Constructs

When designing a database schema, the choice of names for entity types, attributes,
relationship types, and (particularly) roles is not always straightforward. One
should choose names that convey, as much as possible, the meanings attached to
the different constructs in the schema. We choose to use singular names for entity
types, rather than plural ones, because the entity type name applies to each indi-
vidual entity belonging to that entity type. In our ER diagrams, we will use the con-
vention that entity type and relationship type names are in uppercase letters,
attribute names have their initial letter capitalized, and role names are in lowercase
letters. We have used this convention in Figure 3.2.

As a general practice, given a narrative description of the database requirements,
the nouns appearing in the narrative tend to give rise to entity type names, and the
verbs tend to indicate names of relationship types. Attribute names generally arise
from additional nouns that describe the nouns corresponding to entity types.

Another naming consideration involves choosing binary relationship names to
make the ER diagram of the schema readable from left to right and from top to bot-
tom. We have generally followed this guideline in Figure 3.2. To explain this nam-
ing convention further, we have one exception to the convention in Figure 3.2—the
DEPENDENTS_OF relationship type, which reads from bottom to top. When we
describe this relationship, we can say that the DEPENDENT entities (bottom entity
type) are DEPENDENTS_OF (relationship name) an EMPLOYEE (top entity type). To
change this to read from top to bottom, we could rename the relationship type to
HAS_DEPENDENTS, which would then read as follows: An EMPLOYEE entity (top
entity type) HAS_DEPENDENTS (relationship name) of type DEPENDENT (bottom
entity type). Notice that this issue arises because each binary relationship can be
described starting from either of the two participating entity types, as discussed in
the beginning of Section 3.4.

3.7.3 Design Choices for ER Conceptual Design

It is occasionally difficult to decide whether a particular concept in the miniworld
should be modeled as an entity type, an attribute, or a relationship type. In this
section, we give some brief guidelines as to which construct should be chosen in
particular situations.

In general, the schema design process should be considered an iterative refinement
process, where an initial design is created and then iteratively refined until the most
suitable design is reached. Some of the refinements that are often used include the
following:

= A concept may be first modeled as an attribute and then refined into a rela-
tionship because it is determined that the attribute is a reference to another
entity type. It is often the case that a pair of such attributes that are inverses of
one another are refined into a binary relationship. We discussed this type of
refinement in detail in Section 3.6. It is important to note that in our notation,
