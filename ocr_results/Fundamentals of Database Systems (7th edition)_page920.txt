Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems

NOSQL systems known as key-value stores. In Section 24.5, we give an overview of
column-based NOSQL systems, with a discussion of Hbase as a representative sys-
tem. Finally, we introduce graph-based NOSQL systems in Section 24.6.

24.3 Document-Based NOSQL Systems
and MongoDB

Document-based or document-oriented NOSQL systems typically store data as
collections of similar documents. These types of systems are also sometimes known
as document stores. The individual documents somewhat resemble complex objects
(see Section 12.3) or XML documents (see Chapter 13), but a major difference
between document-based systems versus object and object-relational systems and
XML is that there is no requirement to specify a schema—rather, the documents are
specified as self-describing data (see Section 13.1). Although the documents in a
collection should be similar, they can have different data elements (attributes), and
new documents can have new data elements that do not exist in any of the current
documents in the collection. The system basically extracts the data element names
from the self-describing documents in the collection, and the user can request that
the system create indexes on some of the data elements. Documents can be speci-
fied in various formats, such as XML (see Chapter 13). A popular language to spec-
ify documents in NOSQL systems is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

There are many document-based NOSQL systems, including MongoDB and
CouchDB, among many others. We will give an overview of MongoDB in this sec-
tion. It is important to note that different systems can use different models, lan-
guages, and implementation methods, but giving a complete survey of all
document-based NOSQL systems is beyond the scope of our presentation.

24.3.1 MongoDB Data Model

MongoDB documents are stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a varia-
tion of JSON with some additional data types and is more efficient for storage than
JSON. Individual documents are stored in a collection. We will use a simple exam-
ple based on our COMPANY database that we used throughout this book. The
operation createCollection is used to create each collection. For example, the fol-
lowing command can be used to create a collection called project to hold PROJECT
objects from the COMPANY database (see Figures 5.5 and 5.6):

db.createCollection(“project’, { capped : true, size : 1310720, max : 500 } )

The first parameter “project” is the name of the collection, which is followed by an
optional document that specifies collection options. In our example, the collection
is capped; this means it has upper limits on its storage space (size) and number of
documents (max). The capping parameters help the system choose the storage
options for each collection. There are other collection options, but we will not dis-
cuss them here.
