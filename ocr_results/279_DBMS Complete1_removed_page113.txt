Prediction

The prediction, as its name implied, is one of a data mining techniques that discovers the
relationship between independent variables and relationship between dependent and
independent variables. For instance, the prediction analysis technique can be used in the sale
to predict profit for the future if we consider the sale is an independent variable, profit could
be a dependent variable. Then based on the historical sale and profit data, we can draw a
fitted regression curve that is used for profit prediction.

Sequential Patterns

Sequential patterns analysis is one of data mining technique that seeks to discover or
identify similar patterns, regular events or trends in transaction data over a business period.

In sales, with historical transaction data, businesses can identify a set of items that
customers buy together different times in a year. Then businesses can use this information to
recommend customers buy it with better deals based on their purchasing frequency in the
past.

Decision trees

The A decision tree is one of the most common used data mining techniques because its
model is easy to understand for users. In decision tree technique, the root of the decision tree
is a simple question or condition that has multiple answers. Each answer then leads to a set
of questions or conditions that help us determine the data so that we can make the final
decision based on it. For example, We use the following decision tree to determine whether
or not to play tennis:

Outlook

Starting at the root node, if the outlook is overcast then we should definitely play tennis. If it
is rainy, we should only play tennis if the wind is the week. And if it is sunny then we
should play tennis in case the humidity is normal.
