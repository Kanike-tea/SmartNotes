e plt.show()’: This function is called to display the linear plot on the screen. After
calling this function, the plot will appear in a graphical window with the specified

labels, title, and grid lines.

When you run this program, it will generate a simple linear plot using the provided data points.
The x and y values are connected by a solid line, and circular markers are placed at each data
point. The x-axis and y-axis are labeled as 'X-Axis' and 'Y-Axis,' respectively, and a title 'Linear
Plot Example' is displayed at the top of the chart. The grid lines are also added for improved
readability. This program demonstrates how to create and customize a basic linear plot using

Matplotlib in Python.

PROGRAM
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data for the linear plot
x= (1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create a linear plot
plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', linestyle='-')

# Add labels and a title
plt.xlabel ('X-Axis')

plt.ylabel ('Y-Axis')
plt.title('Linear Plot Example')

# Show the plot

plt.grid() # Add a grid for better readability
plt.show()
