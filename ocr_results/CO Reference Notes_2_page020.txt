MECHANISMS USED FOR INTERFACING I/O-DEVICES

1) Program Controlled I/O

e Processor repeatedly checks status-flag to achieve required synchronization b/w processor &

W/O device. (We say that the processor polls the device).
e Main drawback:
© The processor wastes time in checking status of device before actual data-transfer takes place.
2) Interrupt I/O
> 1/O-device initiates the action instead of the processor.

» I/O-device sends an INTR signal over bus whenever it is ready for a data-transfer operation.
> Like this, required synchronization is done between processor & I/O device.

3) Direct Memory Access (DMA)
> Device-interface transfer data directly to/from the memory w/o continuous involvement
by the processor.
> DMA is a technique used for high speed I/O-device.

INTERRUPTS

> The processor can be performing its own task without the need to continuously check the I/O-device.
> The routine executed in response to an interrupt-request is called ISR.
> The processor must inform the device that its request has been recognized by sending INTA

signal. (INTR > Interrupt Request, INTA > Interrupt Acknowledge, ISR > Interrupt Service
Routine)

> For example, consider COMPUTE and PRINT routines (Figure 3.6).
