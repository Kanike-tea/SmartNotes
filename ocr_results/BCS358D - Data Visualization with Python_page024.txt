Lab Manual BCS358D-Data Visualization with Python Laboratory

If you want to access Python through the command line but you didn’t add Python to your

environment variables during installation, then you can still do it manually.

Before you start, locate the Python installation directory on your system. The following

directories are examples of the default directory paths:

= C:\Program Files\Python310: if you selected Install for all users during installation, then
the directory will be system-wide.

= C:\Users\Sammy\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310: if you didn’t select
Install for all users during installation, then the directory will be in the Windows user

path.

Note that the folder name will be different if you installed a different version, but will still start

with Python.

1. Go to Start and enter advanced system settings in the search bar.
2. Click View advanced system settings.
3. In the System Properties dialog, click the Advanced tab and then click Environment
Variables.
4. Depending on your installation:
= If you selected Install for all users during installation, select Path from the list of
System Variables and click Edit.
= If you didn’t select Install for all users during installation, select Path from the
list of User Variables and click Edit.
5. Click New and enter the Python directory path, then click OK until all the dialogs are

closed.
Step 4 — Verify the Python Installation

You can verify whether the Python installation is successful either through the command line or

through the Integrated Development Environment (IDLE) application, if you chose to install it.
Go to Start and enter cmd in the search bar. Click Command Prompt.

Enter the following command in the command prompt:

python --version
