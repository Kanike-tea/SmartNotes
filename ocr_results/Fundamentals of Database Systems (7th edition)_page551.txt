15.3 Algorithms for Relational Database Schema Design

FDI: Property_id —> Lot#, County, Area

FD2: Lot#, County > Area, Property_id

FD3: Area > County
‘These were called FD1, FD2, and FD5 in Figure 14.13(a). The meanings of the above
attributes and the implication of the above functional dependencies were explained
in Section 14.4.For ease of reference, let us abbreviate the above attributes with the
first letter for each and represent the functional dependencies as the set

F:{P—LCA,LC > AP,A>C}

‘The universal relation with abbreviated attributes is U (P, C, L, A). If we apply the
minimal cover Algorithm 15.2 to F, (in step 2) we first represent the set F as

F{PSL,P>3C,P>A,LC>A,LC>P,A>C}

In the set F, P—> A can be inferred from P - LC and LC = A; hence P > A by tran-
sitivity and is therefore redundant. Thus, one possible minimal cover is

Minimal cover GX: {P > LC, LC > AP, A> C}

In step 2 of Algorithm 15.4, we produce design X (before removing redundant rela-
tions) using the above minimal cover as

Design X: Rj (P,L, C), Ro (L, C, A, P), and R; (A, C)
In step 4 of the algorithm, we find that R3 is subsumed by R; (that is, R3 is always a
projection of Ry and R; is a projection of R, as well). Hence both of those relations

are redundant. Thus the 3NF schema that achieves both of the desirable properties
is (after removing redundant relations)

Design X: R; (L, C, A, P).

or, in other words it is identical to the relation LOTS1A (Property_id, Lot#, County,
Area) that we had determined to be in 3NF in Section 14.4.2.

Example 2 of Algorithm 15.4 (Case Y). Starting with LOTS1A as the universal
relation and with the same given set of functional dependencies, the second step of
the minimal cover Algorithm 15.2 produces, as before,

F{P3C,PA,P9L,LC>A,LC>P,A>C}

The FD LC — A may be considered redundant because LC — P and P > A implies
LC — A by transitivity. Also, P + C may be considered to be redundant because
P— AandA— C implies P > C by transitivity. This gives a different minimal cover as

Minimal cover GY: {P > LA, LC > P,A>C}
‘The alternative design Y produced by the algorithm now is
Design Y: S; (P, A, L), So (L, G, P), and S3 (A, C)

Note that this design has three 3NF relations, none of which can be considered as
redundant by the condition in step 4. All FDs in the original set F are preserved. The
