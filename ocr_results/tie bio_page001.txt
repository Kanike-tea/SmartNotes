2. Write a brief note on cellulose based water filters.
Answer:

The interest in the use of biobased filters for water purification has increased in recent years,
as such filters have the potential to be affordable, lightweight and biodegradable. Research
has been focused on creating biobased membranes for micro- and ultrafiltration from
cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs).
Filters based on cellulose pulp fibers do usually have large pores that facilitate water
percolation but they do not sufficiently remove bacteria through size exclusion; other
techniques are therefore needed to achieve a bacteria-reducing effect. Several groups have
addressed this issue by incorporating antibacterial metal nanoparticles into cellulose-based
water filters; both silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) are known
to have good antibacterial effects.
An alternative method to physically remove bacteria from water, while keeping the filter pore
size larger than bacteria, is to use positively charged filters that adsorb negatively charged
bacteria onto the surfaces of the filters.
This allows negatively charged particles much smaller than the filter pore size to be
efficiently removed from water and this is an interesting approach for removing bacteria from
water without adding any toxic chemicals or reducing the flow by reducing the pore size.
Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have a negative net surface charge on the
cell envelope, due to peptidoglycans, liposaccharides and proteins in the cell wall, and this
makes their removal non- selective and efficient for most types of bacteria.
Methods used for the same are:

« LBL [Layer By Layer] MODIFICATION

« NITROGEN ANALYSIS

« SEM [ Scanning Electron Microscope]

« FLOW RATE FOR FREE FLOW FILTRATION

« BACTERIAL REMOVAL EFFICIENCY OF FILTRATION

« FILTRATION OF NATURAL WATER SAMPLES

3. Explain the role of PHA and PLA as bio plastics.
Answer:

PLA is both: biobased and biodegradable under industrial composting conditions (at a high
temperature, around 58 °C). Because of its good mechanical properties, processability,
