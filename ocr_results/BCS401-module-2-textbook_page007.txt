or “bottom up” by multiplying 1 by a n times. (Yes, it is the same as the brute-force
algorithm, but we have come to it by a different thought process.) More interesting
examples of decrease-by-one algorithms appear in Sections 4.1-4.3.

The decrease-by-a-constant-factor technique suggests reducing a problem
instance by the same constant factor on each iteration of the algorithm. In most
applications, this constant factor is equal to two. (Can you give an example of such
an algorithm?) The decrease-by-half idea is illustrated in Figure 4.2.

For an example, let us revisit the exponentiation problem. If the instance of
size n is to compute a”, the instance of half its size is to compute a”/”, with the
obvious relationship between the two: a” = (a"/2)?, But since we consider here
instances with integer exponents only, the former does not work for odd n. If n is
odd, we have to compute a”! by using the rule for even-valued exponents and
then multiply the result by a. To summarize, we have the following formula:
