Disadvantages of using Recursion
¢ Non recursive version of the program is more efficient when compared to recursive version interms of
time and space
e Non recursive versions do not have the overhead of entering and exiting from the block.
e In recursive program the local variables have to be maintained using a stack,which can beavoided
in an iterative(non recursive) version

Advantage of using Recursion
e Recursive program is the most natural and logical way of solving some of the problems

e Ifa stack can be eliminated in a recursive program without having any local variables thenthey can
be as fast its non recursive version,

Difference between iterative and recursive functions

Iterative Recursive

Implemented using —_ looping | Implemented using recursive calls to
statements functions

Executes faster Takes more time to execute

Memory utilization is Less Memory utilization is more

Lines of code are more Lines of code are lesser

Does not require stack Implementation requires stack
