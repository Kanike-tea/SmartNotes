e For complete binary tree the array representation is ideal, as no space is wasted.
e For the skewed tree less than half the array is utilized.

Linked representation:

The problems in array representation are:
e It is good forcomplete binary trees,but more memory is wasted for skewed and many
other binary trees.
e The insertion and deletion of nodes from the middle of a tree require the movement of
many nodes to reflect the change in level number of these nodes.

These problems can be easily overcome by linked representation

Each node has three fields
e LeftChild - which contains the address of left subtree
e RightChild - which contains the address of right subtree.
e Data - which contains the actual information

C Code for node:

typedef struct node *treepointer;
typedef struct {
int data;
treepointer leftChild, rightChild;
}node;
