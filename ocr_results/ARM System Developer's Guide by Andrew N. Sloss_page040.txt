Table 2.3 Jazelle instruction set features.
Jazelle (cpsr T = 0, J = 1)
Instruction size 8-bit
Core instructions — Over 60% of the Java bytecodes are implemented in hardware;
the rest of the codes are implemented in software.
The Jazelle instruction set is a closed instruction set and is not openly available. Table 2.3
gives the Jazelle instruction set features.
2.2.4 INTERRUPT MASKS

Interrupt masks are used to stop specific interrupt requests from interrupting the processor.
There are two interrupt request levels available on the ARM processor core—interrupt
request (IRQ) and fast interrupt request (FIQ).

The cpsr has two interrupt mask bits, 7 and 6 (or I and F), which control the masking
of IRQ and FIQ, respectively. The I bit masks IRQ when set to binary 1, and similarly the
F bit masks FIQ when set to binary 1.

2.2.5 CONDITION FLAGS

Condition flags are updated by comparisons and the result of ALU operations that specify
the S instruction suffix. For example, ifa SUBS subtract instruction results in a register value
of zero, then the Z flag in the cpsr is set. This particular subtract instruction specifically
updates the cpsr.
