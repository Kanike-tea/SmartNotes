The infinite region Rs is bound by S edges plus a pendant edge. Therefore, d(Rs) = 7:
(Recall that while determining the degree of a region, a pendant edge is counted twice).
Accordingly,
(Ri) + d(R2) + d(R3) + d(R,) = 18
= twice the no. of edges. =

A connected planar graph G has 9 vertices with degrees 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.
Find the number of regions of G.
p The given graph has n = 9 vertices. Let m be the number of edges and r be the number of
regions.
By the hand shaking property, we have
2m = sum of degrees of vertices
=24+2434+34+34+44+54+64+6= 34.

Therefore, m = 17.
By using the Euler’s formula, we find that
r=m-—n+2=17-9+2=10

Thus, the given graph has 10 regions. s

eMaey Let G be a 4-regular connected planar graph having 16 edges. Find the number
of regions of G.

> Letn be the number of vertices in G. Then each of these vertices has degree 4 and the sum
of the degrees is 4n. Since G has 16 edges, this sum must be equal to 2 x 16 = 32 (by the
handshaking property). Thus, 4n = 32 so that n = 8. If r is the number of regions of G, then
by using Euler’s formula, we find that r = m-n+2= 16-8+2=10. 2

Can a connected simple graph G with n = 1000 vertices and m = 3000 edges be

planar?
> Ifthe given graph G is planar, we should have m < 3n — 6 (by Corollary 1); that is 3000 <
(3 x 1000) ~ 6 which is not possible. Therefore, G cannot be a planar graph. 2

Find the maximum number of edges possible in a connected simple planar graph
with eight vertices,
z By Corollary 1, we should have m < 3n — 6. When n = 8, we have 3n - 6 = 18. Hence, we
3] s .
Ould have m < 18, Thus, the maximum number of edges possible is 18. ®
