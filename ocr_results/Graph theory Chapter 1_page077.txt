This contradicts the assumption that m > in -1)(n-2).
Therefore, the graph should be connected.

Remark: The converse of the corollary is.not necessarily true. That is, if a simple graph with
n vertices and m edges is connected, then it is not necessary that m > 4(n — 1)(- 2).

To see this, consider the graph shown below:

Figure 1.114

This graph has n = 5 vertices and m = 4 edges and is connected. We note that m = 4 isp
greater that dn -l)\(n-2) =6.
Theorem 3 . A connected graph with n vertices has at least n — | edges.
Proof: Since the graph is connected, n > 2. If m denotes the number of edges, we have
