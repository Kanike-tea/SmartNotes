30.32. Consider the relational database schema in Figure 5.5. Suppose that all the

relations were created by (and hence are owned by) user X, who wants to

grant the following privileges to user accounts A, B, C, D, and E:

a. Account A can retrieve or modify any relation except DEPENDENT and
can grant any of these privileges to other users.

b. Account B can retrieve all the attributes of EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT
except for Salary, Mgr_ssn, and Mgr_start_date.

c. Account C can retrieve or modify WORKS_ON but can only retrieve the
Frame, Minit, Lname, and Ssn attributes of EMPLOYEE and the Pname and
Pnumber attributes of PROJECT.

d. Account D can retrieve any attribute of EMPLOYEE or DEPENDENT and
can modify DEPENDENT.

e. Account E can retrieve any attribute of EMPLOYEE but only for EMPLOYEE
tuples that have Dno = 3.

f. Write SQL statements to grant these privileges. Use views where appropriate.

30.33. Suppose that privilege (a) of Exercise 30.32 is to be given with GRANT
OPTION but only so that account A can grant it to at most five accounts, and
each of these accounts can propagate the privilege to other accounts but
without the GRANT OPTION privilege. What would the horizontal and verti-
cal propagation limits be in this case?

30.34. Consider the relation shown in Figure 30.2(d). How would it appear to a
user with classification U? Suppose that a classification U user tries to update
the salary of ‘Smith’ to $50,000; what would be the result of this action?

Authorization based on granting and revoking privileges was proposed for the
SYSTEM R experimental DBMS and is presented in Griffiths and Wade (1976).
Several books discuss security in databases and computer systems in general,
including the books by Leiss (1982a), Fernandez et al. (1981), and Fugini et al.
(1995). Natan (2005) is a practical book on security and auditing implementation
issues in all major RDBMSs.

Many papers discuss different techniques for the design and protection of statistical
databases. They include McLeish (1989), Chin and Ozsoyoglu (1981), Leiss (1982),
Wong (1984), and Denning (1980). Ghosh (1984) discusses the use of statistical data-
bases for quality control. There are also many papers discussing cryptography and data
encryption, including Diffie and Hellman (1979), Rivest et al. (1978), Akl (1983),
Pfleeger and Pfleeger (2007), Omura et al. (1990), Stallings (2000), and Iyer at al. (2004).

Halfond et al. (2006) helps us understand the concepts of SQL injection attacks and
the various threats imposed by them. The white paper Oracle (2007a) explains how
Oracle is less prone to SQL injection attack as compared to SQL Server. Oracle
