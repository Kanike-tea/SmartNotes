(a) ‘Weight of articles. : .

(b) Length of nails produced by a machine.

(c)’ Observing the pointer on a speedometer / voltmeter.

(4) Conducting a'suirvey on the life of electric bulbs.

These are some of the examples of a continuous random variable.

Generally counting problems correspond to discrete random variables and measuring
problems lead.to continuous random variables,

According to the category of the random variable we have two types of probability
distributions. oO

* Probability function and Discrete probability distribution
If for each value x; of a discrete random variable X, we assign a real number
P( x;) such that

(1) p(x) 20 QE ply)=1
then the function p(x) is called a probability function.
If the probability that X take the values x, is p, , then ;

P(X= 4) =p, or p(x).

"| The set of values [x;, p(x;)] is called a discrete ( finite) probability distribution

of the discrete random ‘variable X. The function P(X) is called the probability
density function (p-d-f) or the probability mass function (p-m-f)
The distribution function f(x) defined by

. x ,
f(x) =P(XSx)=> p(x;), x being an integer is called the
cumulative distribution function (c:d-f)

We are already familiar. with the definitions of mean (x) and variance (07) fora
general frequency distribution. That is

d We can as well define the mean and variance of the discrete probability distribution.
