e Register r13 is traditionally used as the stack pointer (sp) and stores the head of the
stack in the current processor mode.
e Register r14 is called the link register (Ir) and is where the core puts the return
address whenever it calls a subroutine.
e Register r15 is the program counter (pc) and contains the address of the next
instruction to be fetched by the processor.
Registers r13 and r14 can also be used as general-purpose registers, which can be particularly
useful since these registers are banked during a processor mode change. However, it is
dangerous to use r13 as a general register when the processor is running any form of
operating system because operating systems often assume that r13 always points to a valid
stack frame.
In addition to the 16 data registers, there are two program status registers: cpsr and spsr (the
current and saved program status registers, respectively).
The register file contains all the registers available to a programmer. Which registers are

visible to the programmer depend upon the current mode of the processor.
