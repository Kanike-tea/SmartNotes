LECTURE-2: DBMS

Database:
A database is organized collection of related data of an organization stored in formatted way which
is shared by multiple users.

The main feature of data in a database are:
1. It must be well organized
2. Itis related
3. It is accessible in a logical order without any difficulty
4. Itis stored only once

For example consider the roll no, name, address of a student stored in a student file. It is collection
of related data with an implicit meaning. Data in the database may be persistent, integrated and
shared.

Persistent:
If data is removed from database due to some explicit request from user to remove.

Integrated:
A database can be a collection of data from different files and when any redundancy among those
files are removed from database is said to be integrated data.

Sharing Data:
The data stored in the database can be shared by multiple users simultaneously without affecting the
correctness of data.

Why Database:

In order to overcome the limitation of a file system, a new approach was required. Hence a database
approach emerged. A database is a persistent collection of logically related data. The initial attempts
were to provide a centralized collection of data. A database has a self describing nature. It contains
not only the data sharing and integration of data of an organization in a single database.

A small database can be handled manually but for a large database and having multiple users it is
difficult to maintain it. In that case a computerized database is useful.
The advantages of database system over traditional, paper based methods of record keeping are:

e@ Compactness: No need for large amount of paper files

e@ Speed: The machine can retrieve and modify the data more faster way then human being

e@ Less drudgery: Much of the maintenance of files by hand is eliminated

e Accuracy: Accurate, up-to-date information is fetched as per requirement of the user at any

time.

Database Management System (DBMS):
A database management system consists of collection of related data and refers to a set of programs
for defining, creation, maintenance and manipulation of a database.
