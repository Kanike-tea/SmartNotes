tuples that show the violation of such an FD. See the illustrative example relation in
Figure 14.8. Here, the following FDs may hold because the four tuples in the current
extension have no violation of these constraints: B > C; C > B; {A, B}  C; {A, B} > D;
and {C, D} > B. However, the following do not hold because we already have viola-
tions of them in the given extension: A — B (tuples 1 and 2 violate this constraint);
B-A (tuples 2 and 3 violate this constraint); D — C (tuples 3 and 4 violate it).

Figure 14.3 introduces a diagrammatic notation for displaying FDs: Each FD is
displayed as a horizontal line. The left-hand-side attributes of the FD are connected
by vertical lines to the line representing the FD, whereas the right-hand-side attri-
butes are connected by the lines with arrows pointing toward the attributes.

We denote by F the set of functional dependencies that are specified on relation
schema R. Typically, the schema designer specifies the functional dependencies that
are semantically obvious; usually, however, numerous other functional dependen-
cies hold in all legal relation instances among sets of attributes that can be derived
from and satisfy the dependencies in F. Those other dependencies can be inferred
or deduced from the FDs in F. We defer the details of inference rules and properties
of functional dependencies to Chapter 15.

14.3 Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys

Having introduced functional dependencies, we are now ready to use them to spec-
ify how to use them to develop a formal methodology for testing and improving
relation schemas. We assume that a set of functional dependencies is given for each
relation, and that each relation has a designated primary key; this information com-
bined with the tests (conditions) for normal forms drives the normalization process
for relational schema design. Most practical relational design projects take one of
the following two approaches:

= Perform a conceptual schema design using a conceptual model such as ER
or EER and map the conceptual design into a set of relations.

= Design the relations based on external knowledge derived from an existing
implementation of files or forms or reports.

Following either of these approaches, it is then useful to evaluate the relations for
goodness and decompose them further as needed to achieve higher normal forms
using the normalization theory presented in this chapter and the next. We focus in
