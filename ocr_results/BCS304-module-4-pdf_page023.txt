A spanning tree is a minimal subgraph G' of G such that V (G) = V(G) and G' is connected.
We define a minimal subgraph as one with the fewest number of edges. Any connected graph
with n vertices must have at least n - 1 edges, and all connected graphs with n - 1 edges are

trees. Therefore, we conclude that a spanning tree has n - 1 edges.
5.2.5 Biconnected Components

An articulation point is a vertex v of G such that the deletion of v, together with all edges
incident on v, produces a graph, G’, that has at least two connected components. For example,

the connected graph of Figure has four articulation points, vertices 1, 3, 5, and 7.

A biconnected component of a connected undirected graph is a maximal biconnected subgraph,
H, of G. By maximal, we mean that G contains no other subgraph that is both biconnected and

properly contains H. F

We can find the biconnected components of a connected undirected graph, G, by using any

depth first spanning tree of G. F
