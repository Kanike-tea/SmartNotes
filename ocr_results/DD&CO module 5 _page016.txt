5.2 Arithmetic Pipeline

«There are various reasons why the pipeline cannot operate at its maximumtheoretical
rate.
o Different segments may take different times to complete their sub operation.

o  Itis not always correct to assume that a nonpipe circuit has the same timedelay as that of
an equivalent pipeline circuit.

« There are two areas of computer design where the pipeline organization isapplicable.
o Arithmetic pipeline
o Instruction pipeline

Arithmetic Pipeline: Introduction

«Pipeline arithmetic units are usually found in very high speed computers
o Floating-point operations, multiplication of fixed-point numbers, and
similarcomputations in scientific problem
« Floating-point operations are easily decomposed into suboperations as demonstratedin Sec. 10-5.
e  Anexample of a pipeline unit for floating-point addition and subtraction is showed inthe following:
o The inputs to the floating-point adder pipeline are two normalized
floating-point binary number

X = Ax 2?
Y=Bx2??

e AandBare two fractions that represent the mantissas, a and b are the exponents.
e — The floating-point addition and subtraction can be performed in four segments, asshown in Fig.
9-6.
« The suboperations that are performed in the four segments are:
o Compare the exponents
= The larger exponent is chosen as the exponent of the result.
o Align the mantissas
