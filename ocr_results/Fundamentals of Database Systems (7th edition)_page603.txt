Noninteger hash field values can be transformed into integers before the mod func-
tion is applied. For character strings, the numeric (ASCII) codes associated with
characters can be used in the transformation—for example, by multiplying those
code values. For a hash field whose data type is a string of 20 characters, Algo-
rithm 16.2(a) can be used to calculate the hash address. We assume that the code
function returns the numeric code of a character and that we are given a hash field
value K of type K: array [1..20] of char (in Pascal) or char K[20] (in C).
