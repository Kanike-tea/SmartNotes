From (1) 6,’-8, = a= amp f’ (29)

6,’-8, = a = amp f’ (Zz) in the limiting case.
Equating the LHS of these equations we have,
6,’-8, = 6,’-6, or 6,’~6,' = @, -8,

That is, angle of intersection at P is the same as the angle of intersection at P’.
Thus the transformation is conformal.

Note: Since f(z) is analytic, u and v satisfy C—R equations u= vy and v,, = nuy “a

This implies that for a conformal transformation the seal J of u, UW x, y. must be
different from zero.

The transformation w = a where 4,b,c,d arereal/ complex constants such that
