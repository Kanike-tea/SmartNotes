Transaction

A transaction is the smallest unit of operation done on a database.
It can be basically of two types:

Read Transaction

Write Transaction

3.2. ACID Properties of transaction:

Atomicity: (all or nothing)

A transaction is said to be atomic if a transaction always executes all its actions in one step or not
executes any actions at all It means either all or none of the transactions operations are performed.

Consistency: (No violation of integrity constraints)

A transaction must preserve the consistency of a database after the execution. The DBMS assumes
that this property holds for each transaction. Ensuring this property of a transaction is the
responsibility of the user.

Isolation: (concurrent changes invisibles)

The transactions must behave as if they are executed in isolation. It means that if several
transactions are executed concurrently the results must be same as if they were executed serially in
some order. The data used during the execution of a transaction cannot be used by a second
transaction until the first one is completed.

Durability: (committed update persist)

The effect of completed or committed transactions should persist even after a crash. It means once a
transaction commits, the system must guarantee that the result of its operations will never be lost, in
spite of subsequent failures.

3.3. States of a transaction:
A transaction must be in one of the following states:

¢ Active: the initial state, the transaction stays in this state while it is executing.

e Partially committed: after the final statement has been executed.

e Failed: when the normal execution can no longer proceed.

e Aborted: after the transaction has been rolled back and the database has been restored to its
state prior to the start of the transaction.

¢ Committed: after successful completion.

The state diagram corresponding to a transaction is shown in Figure.
