1.3. Jsomorphism

in other words, two graphs G and G’ are said to be isomorphic (to each other) if there
js a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and between their edges such that the
adjacency of vertices is preserved’. Such graphs will have the same structure; they differ
only in the way their vertices and edges are labeled or only in the way they are represented
geometrically. For many purposes, we regard them as essentially the same graphs.

When G and G’ are isomorphic, we write G = G’,

When a vertex A of G corresponds to the vertex A’ = f(A) of G’ under a one-to-one
correspondence f : G — G’, we write A + A’. Similarly, we write (A, B} @ {A’, BY} to mean
that the edge AB of G and the edge A’ B’ of G’ correspond to each other, under f.

For example, look at the two graphs shown in Figure 1.45.

A B Pp Q
D Cc s
(a) (b)
Figure 1.45

Consider the following one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of these two graphs:

AGP, BeQd, CeR, Des.
Under this correspondence, the edges in the two graphs correspond with each other, as
indicated below:
{A,B} 2 {P,Q}, {A.C} @ {PR}, {4,D} @ {PS},
(B,C) 9 {Q,R), {B,D} (2,5), {C.D} {RS}

We check that the above-indicated one-to-one correspondence between the vertices/edges
f the two graphs preserves the adjacency of the vertices. The existence of this correspondence
Toves that the two graphs are isomorphic. (Note that both the graphs represent the complete
Taph Ky)
Next, consider the two graphs shown in Figure 1.46.

OE "
adjacency of vertices is preserved” means that, for any two vertices w and v in G, if u, v are adjacent in G then
Somresponding vertices u’, ¥ in G’ are also adjacent in G’. ie tts
