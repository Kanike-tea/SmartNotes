1128 Chapter 30 Database Security

The term precision, when used in the security area, refers to allowing as much as
possible of the data to be available, subject to protecting exactly the subset of data
that is sensitive. The definitions of security versus precision are as follows:

= Security: Means of ensuring that data is kept safe from corruption and that
access to it is suitably controlled. To provide security means to disclose only
nonsensitive data and to reject any query that references a sensitive field.

= Precision: To protect all sensitive data while disclosing or making avail-
able as much nonsensitive data as possible. Note that this definition of pre-
cision is not related to the precision of information retrieval defined in
Section 27.6.1.

The ideal combination is to maintain perfect security with maximum precision. If
we want to maintain security, precision must be sacrificed to some degree. Hence
there is typically a tradeoff between security and precision.

30.1.6 Relationship between Information Security
and Information Privacy

The rapid advancement of the use of information technology (IT) in industry, govern-
ment, and academia raises challenging questions and problems regarding the protec-
tion and use of personal information. Questions of who has what rights to information
about individuals for which purposes become more important as we move toward a
world in which it is technically possible to know just about anything about anyone.

Deciding how to design privacy considerations in technology for the future includes
philosophical, legal, and practical dimensions. There is a considerable overlap
between issues related to access to resources (security) and issues related to appro-
priate use of information (privacy). We now define the difference between security
and privacy.

Security in information technology refers to many aspects of protecting a system
from unauthorized use, including authentication of users, information encryption,
access control, firewall policies, and intrusion detection. For our purposes here, we
will limit our treatment of security to the concepts associated with how well a sys-
tem can protect access to information it contains. The concept of privacy goes
beyond security. Privacy examines how well the use of personal information that
the system acquires about a user conforms to the explicit or implicit assumptions
regarding that use. From an end user perspective, privacy can be considered from
two different perspectives: preventing storage of personal information versus ensur-
ing appropriate use of personal information.

For the purposes of this chapter, a simple but useful definition of privacy is the abil-
ity of individuals to control the terms under which their personal information is
acquired and used. In summary, security involves technology to ensure that infor-
mation is appropriately protected. Security is a required building block for privacy.
Privacy involves mechanisms to support compliance with some basic principles and
other explicitly stated policies. One basic principle is that people should be informed
