1) Transfer a word of data from one register to another or to the ALU.

2) Perform arithmetic or a logic operation and store the result in a register.

3) Fetch the contents of a given memory-location and load them into a register.

4) Store a word of data from a register into a given memory-location.
«Disadvantage: Only one data-word can be transferred over the bus ina
clock cycle. Solution: Provide multiple internal-paths. Multiple paths allow
several data- transfers to take place in parallel.
REGISTER TRANSFERS
eInstruction execution involves a sequence of steps in which data are
transferredfrom one register to another.
«For each register, two control-signals are used: Riin & Riout. These are

called Gating Signals

¢ Riin=1,the data on the bus are loaded into Ri,
¢ Riout=1,the contents of register are placed on the bus,
¢ Riout=0,the bus can be used for transferring data from other registers.
Suppose we wish to transfer the contents of register R1 to register R2.This
can be accomplished as follows:

1. Enable the output of registers R1 by setting Rlout to 1 (Figure 7.2).
This places thecontents of R1 on processor-bus.

2. Enable the input of register R4 by setting R4in to 1.This loads data from
processor-bus into register R4.

e All operations and data transfers within the processor take place

within time-periods defined by the processor-clock.
