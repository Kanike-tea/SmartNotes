Exercise Programs on Time Series and maps using Plotl

Libraries

1. Modify the program to include more data points, customize the appearance of the plot, and
add appropriate labels.

2. Experiment with different color scales, try a world map instead of country names, and
customize the map's appearance.

3. Try using your own time series and map data, customize subplot titles, and explore different

configurations for subplotting.
