sa Pipelining

Pipelining is a technique of decomposing a sequential process into
suboperations, with each subprocess being executed in a special dedicated
segment that operates concurrently with all other segments. The name “pipeline”
implies aflow of information analogous to an industrial assembly line. It is
characteristic of pipelines that severalcomputations can be in progress in distinct
segments at the same time.

« Perhaps the simplest way of viewing the pipeline structure is to imagine that each segment consists
ofan input register followed by a combinational circuit.
o The register holds the data.
o  Thecombinational circuit performs the suboperation in the particularsegment.
eA clock is applied to all registers after enough time has elapsed to perform allsegment

activity.
- Example

« — The pipeline organization will be demonstrated by means of a simple example.
o To perform the combined multiply and add operations with a stream
ofnumbers
Ai* Bi + Ci fori = 1, 2, 3, 7

« Each suboperation is to be implemented in a segment within a pipeline.

o RI€©A,R2€B Input A; and B;
o R3€R1*R2,R4 €C;Multiply and input C;
o RS€©R3+R4 Add C; to product

The five registers are loaded with new data every clock pulse. The effect of
each clock is shownin Table 9-1. The first clock pulse transfers A1 and 31 into R1
andR2. The second clockpulse transfers the product of R1 and R2 into R3 and Clinto
R4. The same clock pulse transfers A2 and B2 into R1 and R2. The third clock pulse
operates on all three segments simultaneously. It places A3 and B3into R1 and R2,
transfers the product of R1 and R2 into R3, transfers C2 intoR4, and places the
sum of R3_and R4 into RS. It takes three clock pulses to fill up the pipe and
retrieve the first output from RS. From there on, each clock produces a new output
and moves the data one step down the pipeline. This happens as longas new input
data flow into the system. When no more input data are available, the clock must
continue until the last output emerges out of the pipeline.

e Each segment has one or two registers and a combinational circuit as shown in Fig. 9-2.
