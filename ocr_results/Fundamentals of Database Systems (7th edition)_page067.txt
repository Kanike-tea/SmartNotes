2.2 Three-Schema Architecture and Data Independence

2. The conceptual level has a conceptual schema, which describes the structure
of the whole database for a community of users. The conceptual schema hides
the details of physical storage structures and concentrates on describing enti-
ties, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints. Usually, a rep-
resentational data model is used to describe the conceptual schema when a
database system is implemented. This implementation conceptual schema is
often based on a conceptual schema design in a high-level data model.

3. The external or view level includes a number of external schemas or user
views. Each external schema describes the part of the database that a partic-
ular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the database from that
user group. As in the previous level, each external schema is typically imple-
mented using a representational data model, possibly based on an external
schema design in a high-level conceptual data model.

The three-schema architecture is a convenient tool with which the user can visual-
ize the schema levels in a database system. Most DBMSs do not separate the three
levels completely and explicitly, but they support the three-schema architecture to
some extent. Some older DBMSs may include physical-level details in the concep-
tual schema. The three-level ANSI architecture has an important place in database
technology development because it clearly separates the users’ external level, the
database’s conceptual level, and the internal storage level for designing a database.
It is very much applicable in the design of DBMSs, even today. In most DBMSs that
support user views, external schemas are specified in the same data model that
describes the conceptual-level information (for example, a relational DBMS like
Oracle or SQLServer uses SQL for this).

Notice that the three schemas are only descriptions of data; the actual data is stored
at the physical level only. In the three-schema architecture, each user group refers
to its own external schema. Hence, the DBMS must transform a request specified
on an external schema into a request against the conceptual schema, and then into
a request on the internal schema for processing over the stored database. If the
request is a database retrieval, the data extracted from the stored database must be
reformatted to match the user’s external view. The processes of transforming
requests and results between levels are called mappings. These mappings may be
time-consuming, so some DBMSs—especially those that are meant to support small
databases—do not support external views. Even in such systems, however, it is nec-
essary to transform requests between the conceptual and internal levels.

2.2.2 Data Independence

The three-schema architecture can be used to further explain the concept of data
independence, which can be defined as the capacity to change the schema at one
level of a database system without having to change the schema at the next higher
level. We can define two types of data independence:

1. Logical data independence is the capacity to change the conceptual schema
without having to change external schemas or application programs. We
