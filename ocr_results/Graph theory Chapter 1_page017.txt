Thus, the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is fa(n -1).

Note: For another proof of this result, see Example 13, Section 1.2.1.

Show that a simple graph of order n = 4nd sizem = 7 anda complete 8a,

of order n = 4 and size m = 5 do not exist.

> Forn = 4, we have

snn~ 1) = 5 x4x3=6.

Since m = 7 exceeds this number, a simple graph of order n = 4 and size m = 7 does ng

exist.
Similarly, since m = 5 is not equal to 5n(n —1) = 6, a complete graph of order 4 and size

m = 5 does not exist. F

Which of the following is a bipartite graph?

Figure 1.25

> The first of the graphs is a bipartite graph, with V; = {P, 5} and V2 = {Q, R} as the bipartites.

The second graph is not a bipartite graph. (Why ?) s

(a) How many vertices and how many edges are there in the complete bipartite
graphs K47 and K7\\?

(b) Ifthe graph K,,12 has 72 edges, what is r?
> Recall that the complete bipartite graph K;,, has r + s vertices and rs edges.
Accordingly:

(a) The graph K47 has 4+7 = 11 vertices and 4x 7 = 28 edges, and the graph K7,11 has 18
vertices and 77 edges.

(b) If the graph K,,12 has 72 edges, we have 12r = 72 so that r = 6.
