Consider the graph shown in Figure 1.104. Find all paths from vertex A to verry

R. Also, indicate their lengths.

> There are four paths from Ato R. These are

Ae Be4R, Ae, Be3Qe6R, AezPesQeoR, Aen Pes Qe3BesR 3

These paths contain, respectively, two, three, three and four edges. Their lengths are, therefore

two, three, three and four, respectively.
Determine the number of different path,

: :
if ~ aoe of paths of length 2 that pass through the vertex vj is the number of pairs ¢
i a ee As v1. Since 3 edges are incident on v;, this number is 3C2 = 3.

V6 are, respectively, i

3C2 =3, 4C,=6, 3C, =3, 2C2=1, 3C2 =3.

Accordingly, the total number of
