Applications: The user-level programs that perform the specific tasks the embedded system is
designed for44 ....

These software components can reside in ROM (firmware) or RAM44 . The trend is towards higher
levels of abstraction in the software stack to simplify development and separate application logic
from the underlying hardware37 .

Complete Explanation of Points 8 (Memory & Cache) and 6 (Embedded Software)

Point 8 (Memory & Cache Memory Band of Tightly Coupled Harvard Technology): (This expands on
the earlier explanation) Embedded systems require memory to store and execute code, and the
choice of memory involves trade-offs between price, performance, and power consumption29 ....
The memory is organized in a hierarchy, with faster, smaller, and more expensive memory closer to
the processor57 .... Cache memory is a crucial component in this hierarchy, acting as a fast buffer
between the core and the main memory58 .... By storing frequently accessed data and instructions, it
significantly reduces the average memory access time, leading to improved performance59 .... ARM
processors can employ either a unified cache (in Von Neumann architectures) for both data and
instructions or separate instruction and data caches (in Harvard architectures)59 .... However, the
non-deterministic nature of cache behavior (due to cache hits and misses) can be problematic for
real-time systems58 .... To address this, Tightly Coupled Memory (TCM) is used in Harvard
architectures60 .... TCM is fast SRAM located close to the processor core, providing guaranteed
access times for critical code and data6 . Unlike cache, TCM access is deterministic, making it suitable
for real-time algorithms . A Harvard architecture can leverage the benefits of both by including both
caches for general performance enhancement and TCM for predictable real-time execution61 ....
The memory width (number of bits accessed at once) also impacts performance, with wider
memories generally leading to better performance but higher cost103 .... Different types of memory
are used in embedded systems, including ROM (for permanent storage and boot code), Flash ROM
(for firmware and non-volatile data), DRAM (common, low-cost RAM requiring refreshing), SRAM
(faster RAM used for caches), and SDRAM (synchronous DRAM with burst access)23 .... Memory
controllers manage the interface between the processor bus and different types of memory24....

Point 6 (Embedded System Software (with diag-till appl)): (This expands on the earlier explanation)
The software in an embedded system is structured in layers of abstraction, starting from the
hardware and moving towards the application37 .... The initialization (boot) code is the foundation,
bringing the hardware from a reset state to a functional state where the OS can take over39 . This
involves configuring essential hardware components like the memory system and peripherals39 ....
Memory remapping, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.1 (not provided), is a key step where the initial
memory layout (often with ROM at the start) is reorganized to place RAM at address 0x00000000,
allowing the reprogrammable exception vector table to be in RAM411 . Diagnostics are often included
in the boot code for hardware testing42 . The booting process involves loading the OS or application
image from non-volatile storage (like Flash) into RAM and then transferring control to its entry
point42 .... The Operating System (OS) acts as a resource manager, efficiently allocating and
controlling the processor time, memory, and peripherals for the running applications45 . Embedded
