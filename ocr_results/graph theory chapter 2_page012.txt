2.2. Euler's formula 113

Hence, by induction, it follows that the result (1) is true for all non-negative integers m.
This completes the proof of the theorem. i

Note: For simplicity in terminology, a region determined by a diagram of a planar graph will
be referred to as a region of the graph.

Corollary 1 . If G is a connected, simple planar graph with n (> 3) vertices, m (> 2) edges and
rregions, then / =.

@ m>= an and (ii) m<3n-6.
Proof: Since the graph G is simple; it has no multiple edges and no loops. As such, every
segion of G must be bounded by three or more edges. Therefore, the total number of edges that
bound all regions is greater than or equal to 3r. On the other hand, an edge is in the boundary
of at most two regions. Therefore, the total number of edges that bound all regions is less than
or equal to 2m. Thus, 37 < 2m. or
m2 >r.
This-is the required result (i). \
Now, substituting for r from the Euler’s formula in the result just proved, we get

m> 5(m—n+2) >

which simplifies to m < 3n — 6. This is the required result Os ea ; e
Corollary 2 . Kuratowski’s first grph, Ks, is non-planar. (

SSS ie ee ee

Proof: The graph Ks is simple, connected and has n = 5 vertices and m = 10 edges; see Figure
2.4. If this graph is planar, then by result (ii) of Corollary 1, we should have m <3n—6; that

is 10 < 15 — 6, which is not true. Therefore, Ks is non-planar. en e

Corollary 3 . Kuratowski’s second graph, K3,3, is non-plapar.
Proof: We first note that K3,3 is simple, connected and has n = 6 vertices and m = 9 edges; see
Figure 2.6,

Suppose K3,3 is planar. By examining Figure 2.6, we note,that K3,3 has no cycles of length
3. Therefore, by result (iii) of Corollary 1, we should have m < 2n — 4; that is, 9 < 12-4,
Which is not true. Hence, K3,3 is non-planar. e
Corollary 4 . Every connected simple planar graph G contains a vertex of degree less than.
ae Suppose every vertex of G is of degree greater than or equal to 6. Then, if di, d2,.--4n

degrees of the n vertices of G, we have d; > 6, dz > 6,...dn 2 6. Adding these, we get

dy + dz,+ +++ + dy = 6n:
