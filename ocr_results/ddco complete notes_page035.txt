Implementation of Full adder using 2 half adder
We know that
S=xy’z’ + xX’yz’?+xyz+x’y’z Caxyt+xztyz
=2)(xy’+x’y)+z(xy+x’y’) =xy+xz(yty’)+yz(x+x’)

=2?(xy’+x’y)+Zz(x’ytxy’)’ SxytxyZtxy’Zt+xyz+x’yz

=27(x ® y)+z(x ® y)’ =xytxyztz(xy’+x’y)
=” A+zZA’ =xy(1+z)+z(xy)
=z@A

C=xy+z(x®y)
S=z ®x @y

(x ®y)z+xy

Binary Adder:

A binary adder is a digital circuit that produces the arithmetic sum of two binary numbers.
It can be constructed with full adders connected in cascade, with the output carry from
each full adder connected to the input carry of the next full adder in the chain.

n-bit numbers requires a chain of n full adders or a chain of one-half adder and n-1
full adders.

* Eg:4bit numbers requires a chain of 4 fulladders or one HA and 3FAs.

* interconnection of four full-adder (FA) circuits to provide a four-bit binary ripple
carry adder

+ The augend bits of A and the addend bits of B are designated by subscript numbers
from right to left, with subscript 0 denoting the least significant bit. The carries are
