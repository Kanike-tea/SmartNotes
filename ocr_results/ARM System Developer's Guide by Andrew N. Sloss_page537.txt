524 Chapter 14 Memory Management Units

The task region dynamically changes page tables during system operation. The task
region translates the same virtual address to a different physical address that depends on
the running task.

Figure 14.19 shows the placement of the regions in virtual and physical memory graph-
ically. The kernel, shared and page table regions map directly to physical memory as blocks
