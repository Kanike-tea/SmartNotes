2. Preorder: Preorder is the procedure of visiting a node, traverse left and continue. When you
cannot continue, move right and begin again or move back until you can move right and resume.

Recursion function:

The Preorder traversal of a binary tree can be recursively defined as
e Visit the root
e Traverse the left subtree in preorder.
e Traverse the right subtree in preorder

void preorder (treepointerptr)

{

if (ptr)

{
printf (“%d”,ptr—data)
preorder (ptr—leftchild);
preorder (ptr—rightchild);

}
}

3.Postorder: Postorder traversal calls for moving down the tree towards the left until you can
go no further. Then move to the right node and then visit the node and continue.

Recursion function:
The Postorder traversal of a binary tree can be recursively defined as
e Traverse the left subtree in postorder.

e Traverse the right subtree in postorder.
e Visit the root

void postorder(treepointerptr)

{

if (ptr)

{
postorder (ptr—leftchild);
postorder (ptr—rightchild);
printf (“%d’,ptr—data) ;

}
}
