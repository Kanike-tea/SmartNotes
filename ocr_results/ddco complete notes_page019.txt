bubble.

> It is possible to represent a NAND gate by an OR graphic symbol that is preceded
by a bubble in each input. The invert-OR symbol for the NAND gate follows
DeMorgan’s theorem and the convention that the negation indicator (bubble)
denotes complementation. The two graphic symbols’ representations are useful in
the analysis and design of NAND circuits. When both symbols are mixed in the
same diagram, the circuit is said to be in mixed notation.

Two-Level Implementation

> The implementation of Boolean functions with NAND gates requires that the
functions be in sum-of-products form. To see the relationship between a sum-
of-products expression and its equivalent NAND implementation, consider the
logic diagrams drawn in Fig. 3.18. All three diagrams are equivalent and
implement the function

F=AB+CD

> The function is implemented in Fig. 3.18(a) with AND and OR gates. In Fig.
3.18(b), the AND gates are replaced by NAND gates and the OR gate is
replaced by a NAND gate with an OR-invert graphic symbol. Remember that a
bubble denotes complementation and two bubbles along the same line represent
double complementation, so both can be removed.
