Complex Variables

; Introduction

We are well acquainted with several concepts associated with a real valued function
y =f(x). We introduce complex valued function w = f(z) [function of a complex
+ variable z] and discuss some topics associated with it.

. Recapitulation of Basic Concepts

A number of the form z = x+iy where x, y are real numbers and i = V-1 or

P=-1 is called a complex number. x iscalled the real partof z and y iscalled the
imaginary part of z. ’

Also z = x—iy is. called the complex conjugate of -z.
