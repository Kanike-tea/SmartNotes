The logic diagram of the half adder implemented in sum of products is shown in Fig.
4.5(a) . It can be also implemented with an exclusive-OR and an AND gate as shown in

Full Adder

+ A full adder is a combinational circuit that forms the arithmetic sum of three bits. It
consists of three inputs and two outputs.

* Two of the input variables, denoted by x and y , represent the two significant bits to
be added. The third input, z , represents the carry from the previous lower significant
position. The two outputs are designated by the symbols S for sum and C for carry.
