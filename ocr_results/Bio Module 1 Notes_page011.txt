¢ Chitin forms the exoskeleton of arthropods and fungal cell walls.
D. Precursor for Biomolecules
¢ Carbohydrates contribute to the synthesis of nucleotides (DNA & RNA via ribose and
deoxyribose).
¢ Serve as precursors for amino acids, lipids, and other biomolecules.

E. Cell Signaling and Communication

¢ Glycoproteins and glycolipids in cell membranes play a role in cell recognition,
immunity, and signaling.

F. Role in Metabolism
¢ Carbohydrates regulate blood sugar levels (e.g., insulin and glucagon control glucose

metabolism).
¢ Maintain osmotic balance in cells.

G. Dietary Importance

¢ Fiber (cellulose) aids in digestion and prevents constipation.
¢ Complex carbohydrates provide sustained energy and regulate metabolic processes.

Carbohydrates are essential for life, playing a crucial role in energy metabolism, structural
integrity, and cellular interactions.

Industrial Applications of Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates have a wide range of applications in various industries, including:

e Food and Beverage: Carbohydrates are widely used as sweeteners, thickeners, and
stabilizers in food and beverage products. They are also used as energy sources in sports
drinks and energy bars.

e Pharmaceuticals: Carbohydrates are used as excipients in pharmaceutical formulations
to improve the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of drugs. They are also used as
a sourceof energy in medical nutrition products.

¢ Cosmetics: Carbohydrates are used in cosmetic products, such as moisturizers,
shampoos, and conditioners, to provide hydration and improve skin and hair health.

¢ Biotechnology: Carbohydrates are widely used in the production of biodegradable
plastics, biofuels, and other renewable energy sources.

e Research: Carbohydrates are widely used as research tools in the fields of immunology,
virology, and cellular biology. They are used as ligands in protein-carbohydrate

interactions and as probes to study cellular signaling pathways.
