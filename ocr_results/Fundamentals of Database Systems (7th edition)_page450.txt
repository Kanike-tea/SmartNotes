What are the origins of the object-oriented approach?
What primary characteristics should an OID possess?

Discuss the various type constructors. How are they used to create complex
object structures?

Discuss the concept of encapsulation, and tell how it is used to create abstract

data types.

Explain what the following terms mean in object-oriented database termi-
nology: method, signature, message, collection, extent.

What is the relationship between a type and its subtype in a type hierarchy?
What is the constraint that is enforced on extents corresponding to types in
the type hierarchy?

What is the difference between persistent and transient objects? How is
persistence handled in typical OO database systems?

How do regular inheritance, multiple inheritance, and selective inheritance
differ?

Discuss the concept of polymorphism/operator overloading.

Discuss how each of the following features is realized in SQL 2008: object identi-
fier, type inheritance, encapsulation of operations, and complex object structures.

In the traditional relational model, creating a table defined both the table
type (schema or attributes) and the table itself (extension or set of current
tuples). How can these two concepts be separated in SQL 2008?

Describe the rules of inheritance in SQL 2008.

. What are the differences and similarities between objects and literals in the

ODMG object model?

List the basic operations of the following built-in interfaces of the
ODMG object model: Object, Collection, Iterator, Set, List, Bag, Array, and
Dictionary.

Describe the built-in structured literals of the ODMG object model and the
operations of each.

What are the differences and similarities of attribute and relationship prop-
erties of a user-defined (atomic) class?

What are the differences and similarities of class inhertance via extends and
interface inheritance via “:” in the ODMG object model?

Discuss how persistence is specified in the ODMG object model in the C++
binding.
