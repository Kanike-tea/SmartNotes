Carbohydrates in cellulose-based water filters

Cellulose-based water filters are filters made from cellulose, a carbohydrate polymer
found in plant cell walls. They are used to remove impurities and contaminants from water
and are an alternative to traditional synthetic polymer filters. The high mechanical strength
and hydrophilic properties of cellulose make it an ideal material for water filtration. Cellulose
filters can effectively remove particles, pathogens, and other contaminants from water,
making it safer and more potable. Cellulose-based water filters are widely used in both
developed and developing countries for household, industrial, and agricultural applications.
They are also an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional filters, as they are

biodegradable and can be produced from renewable resources.

Properties of cellulose-based water filter

Cellulose-based water filters have several properties that make them an attractive

choicefor water filtration:

e High Porosity: Cellulose-based water filters have a high porosity structure, which

allows them to efficiently remove impurities and contaminants from water.

¢ Biodegradability: Cellulose-based water filters are made from a biodegradable material,
