(b) NAND gates

The general procedure for converting a multilevel AND—OR diagram into an all-NAND diagram using

mixed notation is as follows:

1. Convert all AND gates to NAND gates with AND-invert graphic symbols.

2. Convert all OR gates to NAND gates with invert-OR graphic symbols.

3. Check all the bubbles in the diagram. For every bubble that is not compensated by another small
circle along the same line, insert an inverter (a one-input NAND gate) or complement the input

literal.

Consider the multilevel Boolean function F = (AB'+ A'B)(C + D')
