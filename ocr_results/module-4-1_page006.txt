PROPERTIES OF BINARY TREES

Lemma 1: [Maximum number of nodes]:
(1) The maximum number of nodes on level i of a binary tree is 2*!,i>1.
(2) The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k is 2*-1,k>1.

Proof:

(1) The proof is by induction on i.

Induction Base: The root is the only node on level i = 1. Hence, the maximum number of nodes
on level i=1 is 2'!=2°= 1.

Induction Hypothesis: Let i be an arbitrary positive integer greater than 1. Assume that the
maximum number of nodes on level i -1lis 2‘?

Induction Step: The maximum number of nodes on level i -1 is 2‘? by the induction hypothesis.
Since each node in a binary tree has a maximum degree of 2, the maximum number of nodes
on level i is two times the maximum number of nodes on level i-1, or 2‘!

(2) The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k is
k k
> (maximum number of nodes on level i) = y 22k!
i=0 i=0

Lemma 2: [Relation between number of leaf nodes and degree-2 nodes]:
For any nonempty binary tree, T, if no is the number of leaf nodes and n2 the number of nodes
of degree 2, then no = n2 + 1.

Proof: Let n; be the number of nodes of degree one and n the total number of nodes.
Since all nodes in T are at most of degree two, we have

n=no +ni+m (1)
Count the number of branches in a binary tree. If B is the number of branches, then
n=B +1.
All branches stem from a node of degree one or two. Thus,
B =n i+ 2m.

Hence, we obtain
n=B+l= ni+2m+1 (2)

Subtracting Eq. (2) from Eq. (1) and rearranging terms, we get

No =n? +1
