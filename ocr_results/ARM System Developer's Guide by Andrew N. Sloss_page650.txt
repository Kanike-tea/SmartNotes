ARM AND THUMB
INSTRUCTION
ENCODINGS

This appendix gives tables for the instruction set encodings of the 32-bit ARM and 16-bit
Thumb instruction sets. We also describe the fields of the processor status registers cpsr
and spsr.

B.1 ARM INSTRUCTION SET ENCODINGS

Table B.1 summarizes the bit encodings for the 32-bit ARM instruction set architec-
ture ARMv6. This table is useful if you need to decode an ARM instruction by hand.
We've expanded the table to aid quick manual decode. Any bitmaps not listed are either
unpredictable or undefined for ARMv6.

To use Table B.1 efficiently, follow this decoding procedure:

= Look at the leading hex digit of the instruction, bits 28 to 31. If this has a value OxF,
then jump to the end of Table B.1. Otherwise, the top hex digit represents a condition
cond, Decode cond using Table B.2.

= Index through Table B.1 using the second hex digit, bits 24 to 27 (shaded).
= Index using bit 4, then bit 7 or bit 23 of the instruction where these bits are shaded.

= Once you have located the correct table entry, look at the bits named op. Concatenate
these to form a binary number that indexes the | separated instruction list on the left.
