¢ Velocity potential, Stream function, Equipotential lines, Stream lines
and Complex potential

We discuss some application aspects based on the two properties of analytic functions.
Let us consider the irrotational motion of an incompressible fluid in two dimensions
and suppose that the flow is in planes parallel to the x-1 y plane. Then the velocity
V.(x, y) ofa fluid particle can be expressed as

Since the motion is irrotational there exists a scalar function $ (x, y) such that

v= Vo(x, w= Salt «++ (2)

Comparing (1) and (2) we have,

The scalar function (x, y) which gives the velocity components v, and v, is called
the velocity potential.

Further, since the fluid is incompressible we have div ifs Vv. V=- 0

That is to say that the velocity potential > (x, y) is harmonic.

Hence (x, y) canbe taken as the real part of an analytic function,

w = f(z) = $(x, y)+iw(x, y) (4

W(X, y) isthe peony lugate harmonic function & we give an interpretation for thesame

Consider y(x, y) = cand differentiate w.r.t. x treating y as a function of x.
