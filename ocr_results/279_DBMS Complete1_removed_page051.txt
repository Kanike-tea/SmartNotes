LECTURE-17: Query Processing
Query Processing
Query Processing would mean the entire process or activity which involves query translation into
low level instructions, query optimization to save resources, cost estimation or evaluation of query,
and extraction of data from the database.
Goal: To find an efficient Query Execution Plan for a given SQL query which would minimize the
cost considerably, especially time.
Cost Factors: Disk accesses [which typically consumes time], read/write operations [which
typically needs resources such as memory/RAM].
The major steps involved in query processing are depicted in the figure below;

OUTPUT

Let us discuss the whole process with an example. Let us consider the following two relations as the
example tables for our discussion;

Employee(Eno, Ename, Phone)

Proj_Assigned(Eno, Proj_No, Role, DOP)
where,

Eno is Employee number,

Ename is Employee name,

Proj_No is Project Number in which an employee is assigned,

Role is the role of an employee in a project,

DOP is duration of the project in months.
With this information, let us write a query to find the list of all employees who are working in a
project which is more than 10 months old.

SELECT Ename

FROM Employee, Proj_Assigned

WHERE Enployee.Eno = Proj_Assigned.Eno AND DOP > 10;
Input:
A query written in SQL is given as input to the query processor. For our case, let us consider the
SQL query written above.
Step 1: Parsing
In this step, the parser of the query processor module checks the syntax of the query, the user’s
privileges to execute the query, the table names and attribute names, etc. The correct table names,
