Thus, SUPERVISE(X, Y) states the fact that X supervises Y. Notice the omission of
the attribute names in the Prolog notation. Attribute names are only represented by
virtue of the position of each argument in a predicate: the first argument represents
the supervisor, and the second argument represents a direct subordinate.

The other two predicate names are defined by rules. The main contributions of
deductive databases are the ability to specify recursive rules and to provide a frame-
work for inferring new information based on the specified rules. A rule is of the
form head :- body, where :- is read as if and only if. A rule usually has a single
predicate to the left of the :- symbol—called the head or left-hand side (LHS) or
conclusion of the rule—and one or more predicates to the right of the :- symbol—
called the body or right-hand side (RHS) or premise(s) of the rule. A predicate
with constants as arguments is said to be ground; we also refer to it as an instantiated
predicate. The arguments of the predicates that appear in a rule typically include
a number of variable symbols, although predicates can also contain constants as
arguments. A rule specifies that, if a particular assignment or binding of constant
values to the variables in the body (RHS predicates) makes all the RHS predicates
true, it also makes the head (LHS predicate) true by using the same assignment of
constant values to variables. Hence, a rule provides us with a way of generating
new facts that are instantiations of the head of the rule. These new facts are
based on facts that already exist, corresponding to the instantiations (or
bindings) of predicates in the body of the rule. Notice that by listing multiple
predicates in the body of a rule we implicitly apply the logical AND operator to
these predicates. Hence, the commas between the RHS predicates may be read
as meaning and.

Consider the definition of the predicate SUPERIOR in Figure 26.11, whose first argu-
ment is an employee name and whose second argument is an employee who is either
a direct or an indirect subordinate of the first employee. By indirect subordinate, we
