\ Collecting duct —

The nephron is comprised of several key structures:

* Bowman's capsule: This is a cup-shaped structure that surrounds the glomerulus and filters waste and
excess fluid from the bloodstream into the renal tubule.

* Glomerulus: A network of tiny blood vessels within the Bowman's capsule that filters waste and excess
fluid from the bloodstream.

+ Proximal convoluted tubule: A segment of the renal tubule that reabsorbs important substances, such as
glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, back into the bloodstream.

+ Loop of Henle: A U-shaped segment of the renal tubule that is critical for the reabsorption of ions and
water.

+ Distal convoluted tubule: A segment of the renal tubule that regulates the levels of electrolytes and other
important substances in the bloodstream.

* Collecting duct: A series of ducts that collect the filtrate from the renal tubules and transport it to the renal
pelvis, where it drains into the ureter and eventually into the bladder.

The nephrons are surrounded by a network of blood vessels, including the afferent arteriole and the efferent
arteriole, which bring blood into and out of the glomerulus, respectively. The filtrate produced by the
nephron passes through the renal tubules, where it is modified by reabsorption and secretion, before being
eliminated from the body as urine.

The mechanism of filtration in the kidneys is a complex process that involves multiple steps to remove
waste and excess fluids from the bloodstream. The following is a summary of the steps involved in the

filtration process:

* Blood enters the kidney through the renal arteries and flows into tiny filtering units called glomeruli.

+ At the glomerulus, the pressure in the blood vessels causes a portion of the plasma and dissolved

substances to filter out and enter a structure called Bowman's capsule.

* In Bowman's capsule, the filtrate is then transferred into the renal tubules, which are the main filtering

units of the kidneys.
