Consider the two polynomials

A(x) = 2x!000 4 1 and

B(x) = x4 + 10x? + 3x74 1.
Figure below shows how these polynomials are stored in the array terms. The index of the first term
of A and B is given by startA and startB, respectively, finishA and finishB give the index of the last
term of A and B respectively. The index of the next free location in the array is given by avail.

For our example, startA = 0, finishA = 1, startB = 2, finishB = 5, and avail =6.

Start A Finish A _ startB FinishB avail

Coef 2 1 1 10 3 1
Exp 1000 0 4 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

e There is no limit on the number of polynomials that we can place in terms.
e The total number of nonzero terms must not be greater than MAX_TERMS.

since A (x) = 2x 1000 + 1 uses only six units of storage: one for startA, one for finishA, two for the
coefficients, and two for the exponents. However, when all the terms are nonzero, the current
representation requires about twice as much space as the first one. This representation is useful only
when the number of non zero terms are more.

Polynomial addition
eC function that adds two polynomials, A and B to obtain the resultant polynomial D = A + B.
The polynomial is added term by term.
e The attach function places the terms of D into the array, terms starting at position avail.,.
If there is not enough space in terms to accommodate D, an error message is printed to the
standard error device and we exit the program with an error condition.

void padd(int startA ,int finishA ,int startB, int finishB, int *startD int *finishD)

/* add A(x) and B(x) to obtain D(x) */

*startD = avail;
while (startA <= finishA && startB <= finishB)

switch(COMPARE(terms[startA ].expon, terms[startB].expon))

case -1: attach(terms[startB ].coef,terms[startB].expon);
