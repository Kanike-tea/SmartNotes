suitable enzyme systems. Amyloglucosidases, pectinases, and glucose oxidases are selected

that are compatible concerning their active pH and temperature range.

Biopolishing

Biopolishing is a finishing process that improves fabric quality by mainly reducing fuzziness
and pilling property of cellulosic fiber. The objective of the process is the elimination of micro
fibrils of cotton through the action of cellulase enzyme. Biopolishing treatment brings the

fabric a cleaner surface, a cooler feel, lustre, and softer feel.
