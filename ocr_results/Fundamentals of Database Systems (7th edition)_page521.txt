14.6 Multivalued Dependency and Fourth Normal Form

Note that if we designate (Student, Instructor) as a primary key of the relation TEACH,
the FD instructor > Course causes a partial (non-fully-functional) dependency of
Course on a part of this key. This FD may be removed as a part of second normaliza-
tion (or by a direct application of the above procedure to achieve BCNF) yielding
exactly the same two relations in the result. This is an example of a case where we
may reach the same ultimate BCNF design via alternate paths of normalization.

14.6 Multivalued Dependency
and Fourth Normal Form

Consider the relation EMP shown in Figure 14.15(a). A tuple in this EMP relation
represents the fact that an employee whose name is Ename works on the project
whose name is Pname and has a dependent whose name is Dname. An employee
may work on several projects and may have several dependents, and the employee’s
projects and dependents are independent of one another.!” To keep the relation
state consistent and to avoid any spurious relationship between the two indepen-
dent attributes, we must have a separate tuple to represent every combination of an
employee’s dependent and an employee’s project. In the relation state shown in
Figure 14.15(a), the employee with Ename Smith works on two projects ‘X’ and ‘Y’
and has two dependents ‘John’ and ‘Anna’, and therefore there are four tuples to
represent these facts together. The relation EMP is an all-key relation (with key
made up of all attributes) and therefore has no f.d.’s and as such qualifies to be a
BCNF relation. We can see that there is an obvious redundancy in the relation
EMP —the dependent information is repeated for every project and the project
information is repeated for every dependent.

As illustrated by the EMP relation, some relations have constraints that cannot be
specified as functional dependencies and hence are not in violation of BCNF. To
address this situation, the concept of multivalued dependency (MVD) was proposed
and, based on this dependency, the fourth normal form was defined. A more formal
discussion of MVDs and their properties is deferred to Chapter 15. Multivalued depen-
dencies are a consequence of first normal form (1NF) (see Section 14.3.4), which disal-
lows an attribute in a tuple to have a set of values. If more than one multivalued attribute
is present, the second option of normalizing the relation (see Section 14.3.4) intro-
duces a multivalued dependency. Informally, whenever two independent 1:N relation-
ships A:B and A:C are mixed in the same relation, R(A, B, C),an MVD may arise. 18

14.6.1 Formal Definition of Multivalued Dependency
Definition. A multivalued dependency X — Y specified on relation schema R,
where X and Y are both subsets of R, specifies the following constraint on any
"in an ER diagram, each would be represented as a multivalued attribute or as a weak entity type
(see Chapter 7).

'8This MVD is denoted as A > BIC.
