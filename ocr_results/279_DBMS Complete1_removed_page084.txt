A attribute A in a relation scheme R is a prime attribute or simply prime if A is part of any
candidate key of the relation. If A is not a part of any candidate key of R, A is called a nonprime
attribute or simply non prime .

Trivial functional dependency:
AFD XY is said to be a trivial functional dependency if Y is subset of X.

Normalization

While designing a database out of an entity—relationship model, the main problem existing in that
“raw” database is redundancy. Redundancy is storing the same data item in more one place. A
redundancy creates several problems like the following:

Extra storage space: storing the same data in many places takes large amount of disk space.
Entering same data more than once during data insertion.

Deleting data from more than one place during deletion.

Modifying data in more than one place.

Anomalies may occur in the database if insertion, deletion, modification ete are no done
properly. It creates inconsistency and unreliability in the database.

To solve this problem, the “raw” database needs to be normalized. This is a step by step process of
removing different kinds of redundancy and anomaly at each step. At each step a specific rule is
followed to remove specific kind of impurity in order to give the database a slim and clean look.

Un-Normalized Form (UNF)
If a table contains non-atomic values at each row, it is said to be in UNF. An atomic value is
something that can not be further decomposed. A non-atomic value, as the name suggests, can be

further decomposed and simplified. Consider the following table:

Emp-Id Emp-Name | Month | Sales | Bank-Id Bank-Name

EOI AA Jan | 1000 BOI SBI
Feb | 1200
Mar 850

E02 BB Jan | 2200 BO2 UTI
Feb | 2500

E03 cc Jan | 1700 BOI SBI
Feb | 1800
Mar | 1850
Apr | 1725

In the sample table above, there are multiple occurrences of rows under each key Emp-Id. Although
considered to be the primary key, Emp-Id cannot give us the unique identification facility for any
single row. Further, each primary key points to a variable length record (3 for E01, 2 for E02 and 4
for E03).
