declared in a single direction, or in both directions, depending on the types of
access expected. If declared in both directions, they may be specified as inverses of
one another, thus enforcing the ODB equivalent of the relational referential integ-
rity constraint.

In RDB, relationships among tuples (records) are specified by attributes with
matching values. These can be considered as value references and are specified via
foreign keys, which are values of primary key attributes repeated in tuples of the
referencing relation. These are limited to being single-valued in each record because
multivalued attributes are not permitted in the basic relational model. Thus, M:N
relationships must be represented not directly, but as a separate relation (table), as
discussed in Section 9.1.

Mapping binary relationships that contain attributes is not straightforward in
ODBs, since the designer must choose in which direction the attributes should be
included. If the attributes are included in both directions, then redundancy in stor-
age will exist and may lead to inconsistent data. Hence, it is sometimes preferable to
use the relational approach of creating a separate table by creating a separate class
to represent the relationship. This approach can also be used for n-ary relation-
ships, with degree n > 2.

Another major area of difference between ODB and RDB design is how inheritance
is handled. In ODB, these structures are built into the model, so the mapping is
achieved by using the inheritance constructs, such as derived (:) and extends. In
relational design, as we discussed in Section 9.2, there are several options to choose
from since no built-in construct exists for inheritance in the basic relational model.
It is important to note, though, that object-relational and extended-relational sys-
tems are adding features to model these constructs directly as well as to include
operation specifications in abstract data types (see Section 12.2).

The third major difference is that in ODB design, it is necessary to specify the oper-
ations early on in the design since they are part of the class specifications. Although
it is important to specify operations during the design phase for all types of data-
bases, the design of operations may be delayed in RDB design as it is not strictly
required until the implementation phase.

There is a philosophical difference between the relational model and the object
model of data in terms of behavioral specification. The relational model does not
mandate the database designers to predefine a set of valid behaviors or operations,
whereas this is a tacit requirement in the object model. One of the claimed advan-
tages of the relational model is the support of ad hoc queries and transactions,
whereas these are against the principle of encapsulation.

In practice, it is becoming commonplace to have database design teams apply
object-based methodologies at early stages of conceptual design so that both the
structure and the use or operations of the data are considered, and a complete spec-
ification is developed during conceptual design. These specifications are then
mapped into relational schemas, constraints, and behavioral artifacts such as trig-
gers or stored procedures (see Sections 5.2 and 13.4).
