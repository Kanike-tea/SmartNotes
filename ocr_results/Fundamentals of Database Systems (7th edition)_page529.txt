b. Does the above relation have a potential candidate key? If it does, what is
it? Ifit does not, why not?

Consider a relation R(A, B, C, D, E) with the following dependencies:
AB—C,CD—E, DEB
Is AB a candidate key of this relation? If not, is ABD? Explain your answer.

Consider the relation R, which has attributes that hold schedules of courses
and sections at a university; R = {Course_no, Sec_no, Offering_dept,
Credit_hours, Course_level, Instructor_ssn, Semester, Year, Days_hours, Room_no,
No_of_students}. Suppose that the following functional dependencies hold on R:

{Course_no} — {Offering_dept, Credit_hours, Course_level}

{Course_no, Sec_no, Semester, Year} — {Days_hours, Room_no,
No_of_students, Instructor_ssn}

{Room_no, Days_hours, Semester, Year} — {Instructor_ssn, Course_no,
Sec_no}

Try to determine which sets of attributes form keys of R. How would you
normalize this relation?

Consider the following relations for an order-processing application data-
base at ABC, Inc.

ORDER (O#, Odate, Cust#, Total_amount)
ORDER_ITEM(O#, I#, Qty_ordered, Total_price, Discount%)

Assume that each item has a different discount. The Total_price refers to one
item, Odate is the date on which the order was placed, and the Total_amount
is the amount of the order. If we apply a natural join on the relations
ORDER _ITEM and ORDER in this database, what does the resulting relation
schema RES look like? What will be its key? Show the FDs in this resulting
relation. Is RES in 2NF? Is it in 3NF? Why or why not? (State assumptions,
if you make any.)

Consider the following relation:
CAR_SALE(Car#, Date_sold, Salesperson#, Commission%, Discount_amt)

Assume that a car may be sold by multiple salespeople, and hence {Car#,
Salesperson#} is the primary key. Additional dependencies are

Date_sold —> Discount_amt and
Salesperson# —> Commission%

Based on the given primary key, is this relation in INF, 2NF, or 3NF? Why
or why not? How would you successively normalize it completely?

Consider the following relation for published books:

BOOK (Book title, Author_name, Book type, List_price, Author_affil,
Publisher)
