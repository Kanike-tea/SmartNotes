Since all the entries of P? are positive P is a-regular stochastic matrix.
We shall find the unique fixed probability vector. That is to find

v = (x,y) such that oP =v where x+y =1

Thus v= (1/3,2/3)

(b) Let us suppose Monday as day 1, then Thursday will be 3 days after Monday.
Given that the person had visited club B on Monday the probability that he visits club

a3) = 3/8. Thus the required probability is 3/8.

61. Astudent’s study habits are as follows. If he studies one night, he is 70% sure not to study
the next night. On the other hand if he does not study one night, he is 60% sure not fo
study the next night. In the long run how often does he study ?

>> The state space of the system is { A, B } where A : Studying B: Not studying.
The associated transition matrix P is as follows .

In order to find the happening in the long run we have to find the unique fixed
: probability vector v.of P. That is to find

‘\y = (x,y) such'that uP. = v where x+y = 1
