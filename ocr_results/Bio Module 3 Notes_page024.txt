Membrane Oxygenators: These are devices that use a semipermeable membrane to transfer
oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air. The blood is pumped through the
membrane, where it comes into contact with air, allowing for the exchange of gases.

Extracorporeal Lung Assist Devices: These devices work by removing carbon dioxide from
the blood and adding oxygen, allowing the patient's natural lungs to rest and heal. One example of
an extracorporeal lung assist device is the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine,
which is used to treat patients with severe respiratory failure. ECMO works by removing carbon
dioxide from the blood and adding oxygen, and it can be used as a bridge to recovery or as a bridge
to lung transplantation.
