Master-slave D flip-flop

[he behavior of the master-slave flip-flop just described dictates that (1) the output may change only
once, (2) a change in the output is triggered by the negative edge of the clock, and (3) the change may
occur only during the clock’s negative level. The value that is produced at the output of the flip-flop is
the value that was stored in the master stage immediately before the negative edge occurred. It is also
possible to design the circuit so that the flip-flop output changes on the positive edge of the clock.

Another construction of an edge-triggered D flip-flop uses three SR latches as shown in below Fig. Two
latches respond to the external D (data) and Clk (clock) inputs. The third latch provides the outputs for
the flip-flop. The S and R inputs of the output latch are maintained at the logic-1 level when Clk = 0.
This causes the output to remain in its present state. Input D may be equal to 0 or 1. If D = 0 when Clk
becomes 1, R changes to 0. This causes the flip-flop to go to the reset state, making Q = 0. If there is a
change in the D input while Clk = 1, terminal R remains at 0 because Q is 0. Thus, the flip-flop is locked
out and is unresponsive to further changes in the input. When the clock returns to 0, R goes to 1, placing
the output latch in the quiescent condition without changing the output. Similarly, if D = 1 when Clk
goes from 0 to 1, S changes to 0. This causes the circuit to go to the set state, making Q = 1. Any change
in D while Clk = 1 does not affect the output.

In sum, when the input clock in the positive-edge-triggered flip-flop makes a positive transition, the
value of D is transferred to Q. A negative transition of the clock (i.e., from | to 0) does not affect the
output, nor is the output affected by changes in D when Clk is in the steady logic-1 level or the logic-0

level. Hence, this type of flip-flop responds to the transition from 0 to 1 and nothing else.

The graphic symbol for the edge-triggered D flip-flop is shown in above Fig. It is similar to the symbol
used for the D latch, except for the arrowhead-like symbol in front of the letter Clk, designating a
dynamic input. The dynamic indicator (>) denotes the fact that the flip-flop responds to the edge
transition of the clock. A bubble outside the block adjacent to the dynamic indicator designates a
negative edge for triggering the circuit. The absence of a bubble designates a positive-edge response.

Other Flip-Flops

The most economical and efficient flip-flop constructed in this manner is the edge-triggered D flip-flop,
because it requires the smallest number of gates. Other types of flip-flops can be constructed by using
the D flip-flop and external logic. Two flip-flops less widely used in the design of digital systems are
the JK and T flip-flops. There are three operations that can be performed with a flip-flop: Set it to 1,
reset it to 0, or complement its output. With only a single input, the D flip-flop can set or reset the output,
