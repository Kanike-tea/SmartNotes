“SELECT Distinct <attribute>” query is evaluated.

18.6. How are aggregate operations implemented?
18.7. How are outer join and non-equi-join implemented?
18.8. What is the iterator concept? What methods are part of an iterator?

18.9. What are the three types of parallel architectures applicable to database sys-
tems? Which one is most commonly used?

18.10. What are the parallel implementations of join?

18.11. What are intraquery and interquery parallelisms? Which one is harder to
achieve in the shared-nothing architecture? Why?

ations prevented?

Exercises

18.13. Consider SQL queries Q1, Q8, QIB, and Q4 in Chapter 6 and Q27 in
Chapter 7.

a. Draw at least two query trees that can represent each of these queries.
Under what circumstances would you use each of your query trees?

b. Draw the initial query tree for each of these queries, and then show how
the query tree is optimized by the algorithm outlined in Section 18.7.

c. For each query, compare your own query trees of part (a) and the initial
and final query trees of part (b).

18.14. A file of 4,096 blocks is to be sorted with an available buffer space of 64
blocks. How many passes will be needed in the merge phase of the external
sort-merge algorithm?

18.15. Cana nondense index be used in the implementation of an aggregate opera-
tor? Why or why not? Illustrate with an example.

18.16. Extend the sort-merge join algorithm to implement the LEFT OUTER JOIN
operation.

We will give references to the literature for the query processing and optimization
area together at the end of Chapter19. Thus the Chapter19 references apply to this
chapter and the next chapter. It is difficult to separate the literature that addresses
just query processing strategies and algorithms from the literature that discusses
the optimization area.
