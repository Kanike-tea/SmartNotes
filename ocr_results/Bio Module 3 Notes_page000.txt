ADAPTATION OF ANATOMICAL PRINCIPLES FOR
BIOENGINEERING DESIGN

Brain as a CPU System:

The human brain can be thought of as a highly sophisticated and complex information processing
system, similar to a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). Both the brain and CPU receive
and process inputs, store information, and perform calculations to produce outputs. However, there
are significant differences between the two, such as the way they store and process information
and the fact that the human brain has the ability to learn and adapt, while a computer's CPU does
not. Additionally, the human brain is capable of performing tasks such as perception, thought, and
emotion, which are beyond the scope of a computer's CPU.
