_Itmay benoted dt the singular points of f(:z) are identified from the factors present
-in the denominator of §(z) and the singular points are the points which make these
factors zero. | 2 oe

Let f(z) be expanded as a Laurettt series about the point z = a in the form

f(z)= = a,(2-a)" +E a, (2a) : www)
* .n=0° n=1

{ An infinite series expansion of an analytic function comprising of positive and
negative powets of (z—@) is called Laurent series ] ‘

then the fist term is called the analytic part of f(z) and the second term is called
the principal. part of f(z). If the principal part of f(z) consists of only a finite

.fumber of terms, say m, then we say that z=a isa pole of order m. In particular a
pole of order 1(m=1) is called a simple pole. .

If the principal part of f(z) at z=a contain infinite number of terms thenz=a is
called an essential singularity of f(z) . Also if the principal part of f(z) is
completely absent (i.e, a_,, = 0) then 'z = a is called a removable singularity of

Remark: From the definition of the pole it follows that if
f(z)= oe) ‘where F(z) is analytic and F(a) ¥ 0, F(b) #0

we get z = ti which are simple poles.
