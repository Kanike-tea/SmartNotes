Data Structures and Applications (15CS33)

When trees are represented in memory, it should be able to distinguish between threads and
pointers. This can be done by adding two additional fields to node structure, ie., leftThread
and rightThread

e If ptrsleftThread = TRUE, then ptr—leftChild contains a thread,
otherwise it contains a pointer to the left child.
e If ptrsrightThread = TRUE, then ptr-rightChild contains a thread,

otherwise it contains a pointer to the right child.

Node Structure:
The node structure is given in C declaration

typedef struct threadTree *threadPointer
typedef struct{
short int leftThread;
threadPointer leftChild;
char data;
threadPointer rightChild;
short int rightThread;
}threadTree;

left_thread left_child data right_child right_thread
TRUE . | — | : ] FALSE |
