COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

1 N (NEGATIVE) Flag:
It is designed to differentiate between positive and negative result.
It is set 1 if the result is negative, and set to 0 if result is positive.
2 Z (ZERO) Flag:
It is set to 1 when the result of an ALU operation is found to zero, otherwise it is cleared.
3 V (OVER FLOW) Flag:

In case of 2° Complement number system n-bit number is capable of representing a
range of numbers and is given by -2™! to +2"! . The Over-Flow flag is set to | if the result
is found to be out of this range.

4 C (CARRY) Flag :

This flag is set to 1 if there is a carry from addition or borrow from subtraction,

otherwise it is cleared.

8. Addressing Modes

The various formats of representing operand in an instruction or location of an operand is called

as “Addressing Mode”. The different types of Addressing Modes are

a) Register Addressing

b) Direct Addressing

c) Immediate Addressing

d)_ Indirect Addressing

e) Index Addressing

f) Relative Addressing

g) Auto Increment Addressing

h)»Auito Decrement Addressing

a. REGISTER ADDRESSING:

In this mode operands are stored in the registers of CPU. The name of the register is directl

specified in the instruction.
Ex: MOVE Ri,R2 Where R1 and R2 are the Source and Destination registers respectively. This
instruction transfers 32 bits of data from R1 register

into R2 register. This instruction does not refer

memory for operands. The operands are directly

available in the registers.
