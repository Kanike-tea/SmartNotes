This is the fourth approximation to the solution of the given initial value problem.

. By putting x =.0.1 and x = 0.2 in the fourth approximation we have

This (0,1) = 1.1103 and: (0.2) = 1.2428

Note: The limits ofintegration 0 and x" has no effect when the terms involved are in powers

. of x like for example : X between 0 and x yields 2 — 0 = x2! However in the case of

terms like &*, cog x etc it does make a difference as we observe

[ehae-P=e-1 i [cosx]p = cosx - cos0 = cosx - 1.

We shall find the analytical solution of the initial value probl i
between the numerical solution and the analytical solution. aa
