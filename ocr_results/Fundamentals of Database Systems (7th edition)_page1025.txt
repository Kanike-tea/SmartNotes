26.4 Multimedia Database Concepts

(such as songs, phone messages, or speeches), and documents (such as books or
articles). The main types of database queries that are needed involve locating mul-
timedia sources that contain certain objects of interest. For example, one may
want to locate all video clips in a video database that include a certain person, say
Michael Jackson. One may also want to retrieve video clips based on certain activ-
ities included in them, such as video clips where a soccer goal is scored by a certain
player or team.

The above types of queries are referred to as content-based retrieval, because the
multimedia source is being retrieved based on its containing certain objects or
activities. Hence, a multimedia database must use some model to organize and
index the multimedia sources based on their contents. Identifying the contents of
multimedia sources is a difficult and time-consuming task. There are two main
approaches. The first is based on automatic analysis of the multimedia sources to
identify certain mathematical characteristics of their contents. This approach uses
different techniques depending on the type of multimedia source (image, video,
audio, or text). The second approach depends on manual identification of the
objects and activities of interest in each multimedia source and on using this infor-
mation to index the sources. This approach can be applied to all multimedia
sources, but it requires a manual preprocessing phase in which a person must scan
each multimedia source to identify and catalog the objects and activities it contains
so that they can be used to index the sources.

In the first part of this section, we will briefly discuss some of the characteristics of
each type of multimedia source—images, video, audio, and text/documents. Then
we will discuss approaches for automatic analysis of images followed by the prob-
lem of object recognition in images. We end this section with some remarks on
analyzing audio sources.

An image is typically stored either in raw form as a set of pixel or cell values, or
in compressed form to save space. The image shape descriptor describes the geo-
metric shape of the raw image, which is typically a rectangle of cells of a certain
width and height. Hence, each image can be represented by an m by n grid of
cells. Each cell contains a pixel value that describes the cell content. In black-
and-white images, pixels can be one bit. In grayscale or color images, a pixel is
multiple bits. Because images may require large amounts of space, they are often
stored in compressed form. Compression standards, such as GIF, JPEG, or
MPEG, use various mathematical transformations to reduce the number of cells
stored but still maintain the main image characteristics. Applicable mathemati-
cal transforms include discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine trans-
form (DCT), and wavelet transforms.

To identify objects of interest in an image, the image is typically divided into
homogeneous segments using a homogeneity predicate. For example, in a color
image, adjacent cells that have similar pixel values are grouped into a segment.
The homogeneity predicate defines conditions for automatically grouping those
cells. Segmentation and compression can hence identify the main characteristics
of an image.
