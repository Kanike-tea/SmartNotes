Due to their high data bandwidth and performance requirements, you will often need to
code DSP algorithms in hand-written assembly. You need fine control of register allocation
and instruction scheduling to achieve the best performance. We cannot cover implemen-
tations of all DSP algorithms in this chapter, so we will concentrate on common examples
and general rules that can be applied to a whole range of DSP algorithms.

Section 8.1 looks at the basic problem of how to represent a signal on the ARM so that
we can process it. Section 8.2 looks at general rules on writing DSP algorithms for the ARM.

Filtering is probably the most commonly used signal processing operation. It can be
used to remove noise, to analyze signals, or in signal compression. We look at audio
filtering in detail in Sections 8.3 and 8.4. Another very common algorithm is the Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT), which converts a signal from a time representation to a frequency
representation or vice versa. We look at the DFT in Section 8.5.

8.1 REPRESENTING A DIGITAL SIGNAL

Before you can process a digital signal, you need to choose a representation of the signal.
How can you describe a signal using only the integer types available on ARM processors?
This is an important problem that will affect the design of the DSP software. Throughout
this chapter we will use the notations x; and x[t] to denote the value of a signal x at time t.
The first notation is often clearer in equations and formulae. The second notation is used
in programming examples as it is closer to the C style of array notation.

8.1.1 CHOOSING A REPRESENTATION

In an analogue signal x[t], the index t and the value x are both continuous real variables.
To convert an analogue signal to a digital signal, we must choose a finite number of
sampling points t; and a digital representation for the sample values x[{j].
