16.2 Secondary Storage Devices

n- 1 blocks. Data is stored on reels of high-capacity magnetic tape, somewhat sim-
ilar to audiotapes or videotapes. A tape drive is required to read the data from or
write the data to a tape reel. Usually, each group of bits that forms a byte is stored
across the tape, and the bytes themselves are stored consecutively on the tape.

A read/write head is used to read or write data on tape. Data records on tape are
also stored in blocks—although the blocks may be substantially larger than those
for disks, and interblock gaps are also quite large. With typical tape densities of
1,600 to 6,250 bytes per inch, a typical interblock gap* of 0.6 inch corresponds to
960 to 3,750 bytes of wasted storage space. It is customary to group many records
together in one block for better space utilization.

The main characteristic of a tape is its requirement that we access the data blocks in
sequential order. To get to a block in the middle of a reel of tape, the tape is mounted
and then scanned until the required block gets under the read/write head. For this
reason, tape access can be slow and tapes are not used to store online data, except for
some specialized applications. However, tapes serve a very important function—
backing up the database. One reason for backup is to keep copies of disk files in case
the data is lost due to a disk crash, which can happen if the disk read/write head
touches the disk surface because of mechanical malfunction. For this reason, disk
files are copied periodically to tape. For many online critical applications, such as
airline reservation systems, to avoid any downtime, mirrored systems are used to
keep three sets of identical disks—two in online operation and one as backup. Here,
offline disks become a backup device. The three are rotated so that they can be
switched in case there is a failure on one of the live disk drives. Tapes can also be
used to store excessively large database files. Database files that are seldom used or
are outdated but required for historical recordkeeping can be archived on tape.
Originally, half-inch reel tape drives were used for data storage employing the so-
called nine-track tapes. Later, smaller 8-mm magnetic tapes (similar to those used in
camcorders) that can store up to 50 GB, as well as 4-mm helical scan data cartridges
and writable CDs and DVDs, became popular media for backing up data files from
PCs and workstations. They are also used for storing images and system libraries.

Backing up enterprise databases so that no transaction information is lost is a major
undertaking. Tape libraries were in vogue and featured slots for several hundred
cartridges; these tape libraries used digital and superdigital linear tapes (DLTs and
SDLTs), both of which have capacities in the hundreds of gigabytes and record data
on linear tracks. These tape libraries are no longer in further development. The LTO
(Linear Tape Open) consortium set up by IBM, HP, and Seagate released the latest
LTO-6 standard in 2012 for tapes. It uses /-inch-wide magnetic tapes like those
used in earlier tape drives but in a somewhat smaller, single-reel enclosed cartridge.
Current generation of libraries use LTO-6 drives, at 2.5-TB cartridge with 160 MB/s
transfer rate. Average seek time is about 80 seconds. The T10000D drive of
Oracle/StorageTek handles 8.5 TB on a single cartridge with transfer rate upto
252 MB/s.
