the pattern by max{d; d} = max{6 — 1, 2} =5.Note that on this iteration it is the
bad-symbol rule that leads to a farther shift of the pattern. The next try finds a
matching substring in the text after successfully matching all six characters of the
pattern with their counterparts in the text. t

When searching for the first occurrence of the pattern, the worst-case effi-
ciency of the Boyer-Moore algorithm is known to be linear. Though this algorithm
runs very fast, especially on large alphabets (relative to the length of the pattern),
many people prefer its simplified versions, such as Horspool’s algorithm, when
dealing with natural-language-like strings.
