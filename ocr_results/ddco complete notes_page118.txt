e Registers: The fastest access is to data held in registers. Hence registers are part of
the memory hierarchy. More speed, small size and cost per bit is also more.

e At the next level of hierarchy, small amount of memory can be directly
implemented on the processor chip.

e¢ This memory is called as processor cache. It holds the copy of recently accessed
data and instructions.

There are 2 levels of caches viz level-1 and level-2.

Level-1 cache is partof the processor and level-2 cache is placed in

between level-1 cache and main memory.

e The level-2 cache is implemented using SRAM chips

e The next level in the memory hierarchy is called as main memory. It is
implemented using dynamic memory components (DRAM). The main
memoryis larger but slower than cache memory. The access time for

main memory is ten times longer than the cache memory

©@ The level next in the memory hierarchy is called as secondary memory.

It holds huge amount of data.

Memory

. The main-memory is built with DRAM

+ SRAMs are used in cache memory, where speed is essential.

+ The Cache-memory is of 2 types:
1) Primary/Processor Cache (Levell or L1 cache)
> It is always located on the processor-chip.
2) Secondary Cache (Level2 or L2 cache)
» It is placed between the primary-cache and the rest of the memory.
