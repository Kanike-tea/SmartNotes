1. Brain functions as a CPU system. Justify.

Ans. The human brain can be thought of as a highly sophisticated and complex information processing system, similar to

a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). Both the brain and CPU receive and process inputs, store information, and

perform calculations to produce outputs. However, there are significant differences between the two, such as the way they

store and process information and the fact that the human brain has the ability to learn and adapt, while a computer's CPU

does not. Additionally, the human brain is capable of performing tasks such as perception, thought, and emotion, which

are beyond the scope of a computer's CPU.
