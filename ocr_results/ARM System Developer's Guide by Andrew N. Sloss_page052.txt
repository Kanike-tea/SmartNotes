Within each ARM family, there are a number of variations of memory management,

cache, and TCM processor extensions. ARM continues to expand both the number of

families available and the different variations within each family.
You can find other processors that execute the ARM ISA such as StrongARM and
XScale. These processors are unique to a particular semiconductor company, in this case

Intel.

Table 2.10 summarizes the different features of the various processors. The next
subsections describe the ARM families in more detail, starting with the ARM7 family.
