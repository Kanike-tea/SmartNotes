27.1 Information Retrieval (IR) Concepts

by Gerald Salton, an IR pioneer.” We can enhance the definition slightly to say that
it applies in the context of unstructured documents to satisfy a user’s information
needs. This field has existed even longer than the database field and was originally
concerned with retrieval of cataloged information in libraries based on titles,
authors, topics, and keywords. In academic programs, the field of IR has long been
a part of Library and Information Science programs. Information in the context of
IR does not require machine-understandable structures, such as in relational data-
base systems. Examples of such information include written texts, abstracts, docu-
ments, books, Web pages, e-mails, instant messages, and collections from digital
libraries. Therefore, all loosely represented (unstructured) or semistructured infor-
mation is also part of the IR discipline.

We introduced XML modeling and retrieval in Chapter 13 and discussed advanced
data types, including spatial, temporal, and multimedia data, in Chapter 26. RDBMS
vendors are providing modules to support many of these data types, as well as XML
data, in the newer versions of their products. These newer versions are sometimes
referred to as extended RDBMSs, or object-relational database management systems
(ORDBMSs; see Chapter 12). The challenge of dealing with unstructured data is
largely an information retrieval problem, although database researchers have been
applying database indexing and search techniques to some of these problems.

IR systems go beyond database systems in that they do not limit the user to a spe-
cific query language, nor do they expect the user to know the structure (schema) or
content of a particular database. IR systems use a user’s information need expressed
as a free-form search request (sometimes called a keyword search query, or just
query) for interpretation by the system. Whereas the IR field historically dealt with
cataloging, processing, and accessing text in the form of documents for decades, in
today’s world the use of Web search engines is becoming the dominant way to find
information. The traditional problems of text indexing and making collections of
documents searchable have been transformed by making the Web itself into a
quickly accessible repository of human knowledge or a virtual digital library.

An IR system can be characterized at different levels: by types of users, types of data,
and the types of the information need, along with the size and scale of the informa-
tion repository it addresses. Different IR systems are designed to address specific
problems that require a combination of different characteristics. These characteris-
tics can be briefly described as follows:

Types of Users. Users can greatly vary in their abilities to interact with compu-
tational systems. This ability depends on a multitude of factors, such as educa-
tion, culture, and past exposure to computational environments. The user may
be an expert user (for example, a curator or a librarian) who is searching for
specific information that is clear in his/her mind, understands the scope and
the structure of the available repository, and forms relevant queries for the task,
or a layperson user with a generic information need. The latter cannot create
highly relevant queries for search (for example, students trying to find infor-
mation about a new topic, researchers trying to assimilate different points of
