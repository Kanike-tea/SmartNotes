2.4 Dual of a planar graph

Consider a connected planar graph G and a plane drawing thereof. Suppose Rj, R3, R3, et»

are the regions (including the exterior region) in thi i
gion) in this drawing. Let nh
using the procedure given below: : eee

(1) Choose one point inside each of th i
‘ € regions Rj, Ry, R3,. i *
Jat ebay 1, Ro, R3,.... Denote these points by 1
2) Ift i i j j i
@) joi beg "ihe na se and Rj are adjacent (i.e. have a common edge, say e,), draw a line 4
Joining the points v; and v* that intersects the common edge e; scactly once
3) If there i
( f 4 more than one edge common to Rj and R;, draw one line e* between the poi
v; and v’ ‘ for each common edge ep, intersecting €p exactl :

(4) For an edge ¢; lying entirely in one region, say Rj, draw a } * int vt inter
