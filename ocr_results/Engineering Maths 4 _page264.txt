Discussion of Conformal Transformations
Given the transformation w = f(z), we put z= x+iy or z= ré® to obtain u
and v as functions of x, yo

tr, 8. We find the image in w- plane corresponding
to the given curve in the z— plane.

Sometimes we need to make some judicious
aining the image in the w—- plane.
y transformation, a few possible questions on the
transformation is given for the benefit of the reader.

¢ Discussion of w = 2”

Consider w = 2.
utiv= (xtiyy orut+iv= (7-)+i(2xy)
usx-y¥ and v=2xy wea)
Case-1: Let us consider Xx = ¢,, ¢, isaconstant.
The set of equations (1) become us a-y pv=2ey
Now y = 0/2c, ‘and substituting this in u we get

u= a-(v/4ce) or vd = amu or v= -42(u-c)

ie,

This is a parabola in the w—plane symmetrical about the real axis with its vertex at
(cy, 0) and focus at the origin. It may be observed that the line x = -¢, is also
transformed into the same parabola,

Case-2: Let us consider Y = Cy, Cy isaconstant.

The set of equations (1) become u = 2-d, v= 2xc,

Now x = v/2c, and substituting thisin u we get u = (745)-2
