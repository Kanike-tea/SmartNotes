9 DIRECTED GRAPHS

The graphs studied in this book so far have been undirected graphs. No
direction was assigned to the edges in a graph. An edge e, between vertices v;
and v; could be considered as going from vertex v; to vertex v; or from v; to v;. In
this chapter we shall consider directed graphs—graphs in which edges have
directions.

Many physical situations require directed graphs. The street map of a city with
one-way streets, flow networks with valves in the pipes, and electrical networks,
for example, are represented by directed graphs. Directed graphs are employed
in abstract representations of computer programs, where the vertices stand for
the program instructions and the edges specify the execution sequence. The
directed graph is an invaluable tool in the study of sequential machines. Directed
graphs in the form of signal-flow graphs are used for system analysis in control
theory.

Most of the concepts and terminology of undirected graphs are also applicable
to directed graphs. For example, the planarity of a graph does not depend on
whether the graph is directed or undirected, and therefore Chapter 5 is applicable
to both directed and undirected graphs. The same is true for most other topics
covered so far. It would be wasteful to devote another eight chapters to the study
of directed graphs, mostly repeating, with minor changes, what has already been
said. In this chapter, therefore, we shall mainly bring out those properties of
directed graphs that are not shared by undirected graphs.

9-1. WHAT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH?

A directed graph (or a digraph for short) G consists of a set of vertices V =
{Vj, Vo, .. .}, a set of edges E = {e), e),...}, and a mapping that maps every
edge onto some ordered pair of vertices (vj, v,). As in the case of undirected
graphs, a vertex is represented by a point and an edge by a line segment between
