Examples of different metal-resistant microbes

Heavy Metal

Examples of Microbes Used

Lead Pseudomonas sp.: Some strains of Pseudomonas bacteria have the ability to
tolerate and accumulate lead.
Bacillus sp.: Certain Bacillus species have been found to exhibit resistance to
lead and can effectively bind and remove it.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae: This yeast species has been shown to adsorb and)
immobilize lead from aqueous solutions.

Cadmium Cupriavidus metallidurans: This bacterium is known for its high resistance t
heavy metals, including cadmium.
Trichoderma spp.: Some species of Trichoderma fungi have shown the ability t
tolerate and accumulate cadmium.
Chlorella vulgaris: This green microalga has been used for cadmium removal due|
to its high metal-binding capacity.

Mercury Pseudomonas putida: Certain strains of Pseudomonas putida have the ability to
tolerate and accumulate mercury.
Penicillium chrysogenum: Some strains of Penicillium chrysogenum fungi have|
shown the capacity to bind and remove mercury.
Spirogyra sp.: This filamentous green alga has been used for mercury removal
due to its ability to accumulate and sequester mercury.

Arsenic Shewanella sp.: Certain strains of Shewanella bacteria have the ability to tolerate

and accumulate arsenic.

Aspergillus niger: Some strains of Aspergillus niger fungi have shown the|
capacity to bind and remove arsenic.

Chlorella vulgaris: This green microalga has been used for arsenic removal due t
its ability to accumulate and sequester arsenic.
