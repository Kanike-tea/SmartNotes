NUMBER REPRESENTATION
¢ Numbers can be represented in 3 formats:
1) Sign and magnitude
2) 1's complement
3) 2's complement
e In all three formats, MSB=0 for +ve numbers & MSB=!1 for -ve numbers.
¢ In sign-and-magnitude system,
negative value is obtained by changing the MSB from 0 to | of the corresponding positive value.
For ex, +5 is represented by 0101 &
-5 is represented by 1101.
¢ In I's complement system,
negative values are obtained by complementing each bit of the corresponding positive number.
For ex, -5 is obtained by complementing each bit in 0101 to yield 1010.
(In other words, the operation of forming the I's complement of a given number is equivalent to

subtracting that number from 2"-1).
¢ In 2's complement system,

forming the 2's complement of a number is done by subtracting that number from 2".
For ex, -5 is obtained by complementing each bit in 0101 & then adding | to yield
1011. (In other words, the 2's complement of a number is obtained by adding | to the 1's complement
of that number).
2's complement system yields the most efficient way to carry out addition/subtraction operations.
