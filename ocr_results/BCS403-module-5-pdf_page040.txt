24.6 NOSQL Graph Databases and Neo4j

24.5.2 Hbase CRUD Operations

Hbase has low-level CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, as in many of
the NOSQL systems. The formats of some of the basic CRUD operations in Hbase
are shown in Figure 24.3(c).

Hbase only provides low-level CRUD operations. It is the responsibility of the
application programs to implement more complex operations, such as joins
between rows in different tables. The create operation creates a new table and spec-
ifies one or more column families associated with that table, but it does not specify
the column qualifiers, as we discussed earlier. The put operation is used for insert-
ing new data or new versions of existing data items. The get operation is for retriev-
ing the data associated with a single row in a table, and the scan operation retrieves
all the rows.

24.5.3 Hbase Storage and Distributed System Concepts

Each Hbase table is divided into a number of regions, where each region will hold a
range of the row keys in the table; this is why the row keys must be lexicographically
ordered. Each region will have a number of stores, where each column family is
assigned to one store within the region. Regions are assigned to region servers
(storage nodes) for storage. A master server (master node) is responsible for moni-
toring the region servers and for splitting a table into regions and assigning regions
to region servers.

Hbase uses the Apache Zookeeper open source system for services related to man-
aging the naming, distribution, and synchronization of the Hbase data on the dis-
tributed Hbase server nodes, as well as for coordination and replication services.
Hbase also uses Apache HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for distributed
file services. So Hbase is built on top of both HDFS and Zookeeper. Zookeeper can
itself have several replicas on several nodes for availability, and it keeps the data it
needs in main memory to speed access to the master servers and region servers.

We will not cover the many additional details about the distributed system architecture
and components of Hbase; a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation. Full
documentation of Hbase is available online (see the bibliographic notes).

24.6 NOSQL Graph Databases and Neo4j

Another category of NOSQL systems is known as graph databases or graph-
oriented NOSQL systems. The data is represented as a graph, which is a collection
of vertices (nodes) and edges. Both nodes and edges can be labeled to indicate the
types of entities and relationships they represent, and it is generally possible to
store data associated with both individual nodes and individual edges. Many sys-
tems can be categorized as graph databases. We will focus our discussion on one
particular system, Neo4j, which is used in many applications. Neo4j is an open
source system, and it is implemented in Java. We will discuss the Neo4j data model
