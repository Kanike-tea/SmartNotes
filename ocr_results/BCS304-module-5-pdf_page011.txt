DP1: Return an element with minimum priority.
Dp2: Return an element with maximum priority.
DP3: Insert an element with an arbitrary priority.
DP4: Delete an element with minimum priority.
DP5: Delete an element with maximum priority.

Example: A DEPQ may be used to implement a network buffer. This buffer holds packets that are waiting
their turn to be sent out over a network link; each packet has an associated priority. When the network link
becomes available, a packet with the highest priority is transmitted. This corresponds to a DeleteMax
operation. When a packet arrives at the buffer from elsewhere in the network, it is added to this buffer.
This corresponds to an Insert operation. If the buffer is full, we must drop a packet with the minimum

priority before we can insert one. This is achieved using a DeleteMin operation.
5.0.7 Leftlist Trees

Let n be the total number of elements in the two priority queues that are to be combined. If heaps are used
to represent priority queues, then the combine operation takes O(n) time. Using a leftist tree, the combine
operation as well as the normal priority queue operations take logarithmic time.

Leftist trees, are defined using the concept of an extended binary tree. An extended binary tree is a binary
tree in which all empty binary sub trees have been replaced by a square node. The square nodes in an
extended binary tree are called external nodes. The original (circular) nodes of the binary tree are called
internal nodes

Let X be a node in an extended binary tree. Let left-child (x) and right-child (x), respectively, denote the
left and right children of the internal node x. Define shortest (x) to be the length of a shortest path from x
to an external node. It is easy to see that shortest (x) satisfies the following recurrence:
