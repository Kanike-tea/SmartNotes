sup 1. We note that among the new 1's, ; is minimum for j= 5, the minimum being t5°= 14.
Among the arcs from the vertices in P to the vertex 5, the arc (6,5) has the least weight.
Let us label this are (6,5) as ps. Also, we adjoin 5 to P so that P = {1,4,6,5} for the
next step. rt

Sep2. We have P = {1, 4,6, 5}, t = 6, tg = 10, t5 = 14. We choose

new f2 = min{tp, ¢5 + gs2} = min{oo, 14 + co} = co,
new 73 = min{ts, ts + 53} = min{co, 14 + 00} = co.

Fourth Iteration

For this iteration, P = {1,4,6,5}, ts = 6, ts = 10, t5 = 14. Also, t2 = ©, 13 = co (new ones

Since both of the new #;’s are equal, we choose one of the j’s, say j = 2. Among the arcs
from the vertices in P to the vertex 2, the arc (4, 2) has least weight. Let us label this arc (4,2)
35 pe. Also, we adjoin 2 to P so that P = {1,4,6,5,2} for the next step. © ay ;
Final Step

At this stage, the vertex left over in P is 3. Among the arcs from the vertices in P to the
vertex 3, the arc (2, 3) has the least weight. Let us label this arc (2,3) as ps. Further, we adjoin
3 P so that P = {1,4,6,5,2.3}. Now, P covers all vertices. Therefore, we stop the process.
