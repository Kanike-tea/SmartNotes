C. Optical Activity

¢ Due to chiral amino acids, proteins can rotate plane-polarized light (L-configuration
is predominant in nature).

D. Colloidal Nature
¢ Proteins form colloidal solutions in water due to their large molecular size.
E. Denaturation

¢ Proteins lose their structure and function when exposed to heat, pH changes, or
chemicals (e.g., cooking egg whites causes protein denaturation).

Chemical Properties of Proteins
A. Amphoteric Nature

¢ Proteins can act as both acids and bases, depending on the pH of the solution.
B. Peptide Bond Formation

¢ Proteins are polypeptides formed by amino acids linked through peptide bonds (-
CO-NH-).

C. Hydrolysis

¢ Proteins can be broken down into amino acids by acids, bases, or enzymes (e.g.,
pepsin, trypsin).

D. Precipitation
¢ Proteins precipitate when treated with salts (salting out), alcohol, or heat.
E. Color Reactions

¢ Proteins give color-based tests, such as:
o Biuret test (violet color) — detects peptide bonds.
o Xanthoproteic test (yellow color) — detects aromatic amino acids.
o Ninhydrin test (blue or purple) — detects free amino acids.

Proteins are vital for life due to their diverse physical and chemical properties, which enable
them to perform structural, catalytic, transport, and regulatory functions in cells.

Functions of Proteins
Proteins perform a wide range of functions in the body, including
1) Catalyzing chemical reactions
e Amylase: An enzyme that breaks down starch into simple sugars like glucose and

maltose. It is found in saliva and pancreatic juice.
