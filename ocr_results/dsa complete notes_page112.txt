Introduction

The first recorded evidence of the use of graph dates back to 1736. When Leonhard Euler used them
to solve the classical Konigsberg bridge problem.

Definitions

V(G)= {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}
E(G) = {el, e2, 3, e4, e5, 6} E(G) = {(v1, v2) (v2, v3) (v1, v3) (v3, v4), (v3, v5) (v5, v6)}.
There are six edges and six vertex in the graph

Undirected Graph: Ina undirected graph the pair of vertices representing an edge is unordered.
thus the pairs (u,v) and (v,u) represent the same edge.
Example:

() («) V(G)={a,b,c,d}

E(G)={(a,b),(a,d),(b,d),(b,c)

Directed Graph (digraph): In a directed graph each edge is represented by a directed pair (u,v), v is
the head and u is the tail of the edge. Therefore (v,u) and(<u,v) represent two different edges
