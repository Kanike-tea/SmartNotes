Multiplication of Large Integers

Some applications, notably modern cryptography, require manipulation of inte-
gers that are over 100 decimal digits long. Since such integers are too long to fit in
a single word of a modern computer, they require special treatment. This practi-
cal need supports investigations of algorithms for efficient manipulation of large
integers. In this section, we outline an interesting algorithm for multiplying such
numbers. Obviously, if we use the conventional pen-and-pencil algorithm for mul-
tiplying two n-digit integers, each of the n digits of the first number is multiplied by
each of the n digits of the second number for the total of n digit multiplications.
(If one of the numbers has fewer digits than the other, we can pad the shorter
number with leading zeros to equalize their lengths.) Though it might appear that
it would be impossible to design an algorithm with fewer than n? digit multiplica-
tions, this turns out not to be the case. The miracle of divide-and-conquer comes
to the rescue to accomplish this feat.

To demonstrate the basic idea of the algorithm, let us start with a case of
two-digit integers, say, 23 and 14. These numbers can be represented as follows:

23=2-101+3-10° and 14=1-10'+4-10°.
Now let us multiply them:
23 «14 = (2-10! 43:10) «1-10! 4+4- 10°)
= (2 « 1)10? + (2 «443% 1)10! + (3 4)10°.

The last formula yields the correct answer of 322, of course, but it uses the same
four digit multiplications as the pen-and-pencil algorithm. Fortunately, we can
compute the middle term with just one digit multiplication by taking advantage
of the products 2 * 1 and 3 » 4 that need to be computed anyway:

2*443%1=(24+3)*(1+4)—-2%*1-3«4,

Of course, there is nothing special about the numbers we just multiplied.
For any pair of two-digit numbers a = aja and b = bibo, their product c can be
computed by the formula
