between them. This means that every vertex in G belongs to either g1 or
g2, but not both.

Since G is connected, there must be at least one edge connecting vertices
in g1 and vertices in g2. Without loss of generality, let (u, v) be such an
edge, where u is in g1 and vis in g2.

Since every vertex in G belongs to either g1 or g2, and there is no vertex
common between them, we can say that there is no path in g1 that
connects u to v, and there is no path in g2 that connects v to u. But this
contradicts the fact that G is connected, which means that there must be
a path between any two vertices in G. Therefore, our assumption that
there exists a connected graph G that can be decomposed into two
subgraphs g1 and g2 such that there is no vertex common between them
is false.

Hence, we have proven that if a connected graph is decomposed into two
subgraphs g1 and g2 there must be at least one vertex common between
gland g2.

c) Yes, the given graphs are isomorphic. The second graph is obtained by
switching the inner and outer cycles in the first graph. A mapping can be
easily obtained by labelling the graphs.
