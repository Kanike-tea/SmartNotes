Ata committee meeting of 10 people, every member of the committee has Pee |
ously sat next to at most four other members round a circular table. Show that the Member,
may be seated in such a way that no one is next to some one they have Previously sat beside

» Consider a graph with 10 vertices representing the 10 members. Let two vertices be joiney q
by an edge if the corresponding members have not previously sat next to each other. Since
member has not previously sat next to at least five members, the degree of every vertex is a
least five (which is one-half of the number of vertices). Therefore, by Theorem 2, the graph
has a Hamilton cycle. This cycle provides a seating arrangement of the desired type 4

Show that the graph shown in Figure 1.129 does not contain a Hamilton cycle.
> We first note that the graph G in Figure 1.129 has 9 vertices and 12 edges. If there isa.
Hamilton cycle in G, it must pass through all the 9 vertices and must therefore contain 9 edges
We observe that three edges are incident at each of the six vertices A, C, D, F,G,1. Of thes
three edges only two can be included in a Hamilton cycle (if it exists). Thus, at every one of
these six vertices one edge has to be excluded. By actual counting, we find that the number.
of edges to be excluded is four (for example, the edges AD, CI, FE, GH). Consequently, the
number of edges that remain in the graph will be 12 — 4 = 8. These eight edges are insufficient
to form a Hamilton cycle in the graph, '
