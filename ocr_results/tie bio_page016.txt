Dual chamber pacemaker. This type carries electrical impulses to the right ventricle and the
right atrium of your heart to help control the timing of contractions between the two
chambers.

Biventricular pacemaker. Biventricular pacing, also called cardiac resynchronization therapy,
is for people who have heart failure and heartbeat problems. This type of pacemaker
stimulates both of the lower heart chambers (the right and left ventricles) to make the heart
beat more efficiently. A pacemaker is implanted to help control your heartbeat. Your doctor
may recommend a temporary pacemaker when you have a slow heartbeat (bradycardia) after
a heart attack, surgery or medication overdose but your heartbeat is otherwise expected to
recover.

Defibrillators are devices that send an electric pulse or shock to the heart to restore a normal
heartbeat. They are used to prevent or correct an arrhythmia, an uneven heartbeat that is too
slow or too fast. If the heart suddenly stops, defibrillators can also help it beat again.
Different types of defibrillators work in different ways. Automated external defibrillators
(AEDs), which are now found in many public spaces, are used to save the lives of people
experiencing cardiac arrest. Even untrained bystanders can use these devices in an
emergency.

Other defibrillators can prevent sudden death among people who have a high risk of a life-
threatening arrhythmia. They include implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which
are surgically placed inside your body, and wearable cardioverter defibrillators (WCDs),
which rest on the body. It can take time and effort to get used to living with a defibrillator,
and it is important to be aware of possible complications.

There are three types of defibrillators: AEDs, ICDs, and WCDs.

An AED is a lightweight, battery-operated, portable device that checks the heart’s rhythm
and sends a shock to the heart to restore normal rhythm. The device is used to help people
having cardiac arrest. The ICD sends a shock to restore a normal heart rhythm. WCDs have
sensors that attach to the skin. They are connected by wires to a unit that checks your heart’s
rhythm and delivers shocks when needed. Like an ICD, the WCD can deliver low- and high-
energy shocks.

. Discuss eye as a camera system.

Answer:

The human eye is a wonderful instrument, relying on refraction and lenses to form images.
There are many similarities between the human eye and a camera, including:

A diaphragm to control the amount of light that gets through to the lens. This is the shutter in
a camera, and the pupil, at the center of the iris, in the human eye. A lens to focus the light
and create an image. The image is real and inverted. A method of sensing the image. In a
camera, film is used to record the image; in the eye, the image is focused on the retina, and a
system of rods and cones is the front end of an image-processing system that converts the
image to electrical impulses and sends the information along the optic nerve to the brain.
