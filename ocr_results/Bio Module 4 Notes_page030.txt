Plant burrs, such as those found on burdock, inspired the invention of Velcro, a popularhook-and-
loop fastening system.

The burrs have small hooks that can latch onto clothing, fur, or feathers, allowing them todisperse

Velcro was invented by Swiss engineer George De Mestral in 1941, after he becamefascinated by the
way burrs clung to his clothes and his dog's fur during a walk. He examined the burrs under a
microscope and found that they had small hooks thatcould latch onto loops in fabric. De Mestral
spent years experimenting with different materials before finally developing Velcro, which consists of
two strips of nylon fabric, one with tiny hooks and the other with small
