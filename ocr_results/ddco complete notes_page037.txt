1. write Verilog code for 4 bit parallel adder using full adder as component.

module fourbit_full_adder(a, b,sum,cout);
input [3:0] a;

input [3:0] b;

output [3:0] sum;

output cout;
wire cl, c2, c3;
full_adder fa0(a
full_adder fal(a
full_adder fa2(a
full_adder fa3(a
endmodule

0], b{0], 0, sum[0], cl);
1], bf1], cl, sum[1], c2);
2], b[2], c2, sum[2], c3);
3], b[3], c3, sum[3], cout);

module full_adder (a, b, cin, sum, cout);
input a, b, cin;

output sum, cout;

assign sum = a*b“cin;

assign cout = (a&b) | (b&cin) | (ciné&a) ;
endmodule

2. Write Verilog code for 4 bit adder .

HDL (Dataflow: Four-Bit Adder)

module binary_adder (

output [3: 0] Sum,
output C_out,
input [3: 0] A,B,
input c_in

»

assign {C_out, Sum} = A+ B + C_in;
endmodule

There are several techniques for reducing the carry propagation time in a parallel adder.
The most widely used technique employs the principle of carry lookahead logic .

Carry Propagation

* Carry Propagation The addition of two binary numbers in parallel implies that all the
bits of the augend and addend are available for computation at the same time.

* Consider the circuit of the full adder shown in Fig. 4.10 . If we define two new binary
variables.
