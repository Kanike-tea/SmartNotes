28.8 Summary

In this chapter, we surveyed the important discipline of data mining, which uses
database technology to discover additional knowledge or patterns in the data. We
gave an illustrative example of knowledge discovery in databases, which has a wider
scope than data mining. For data mining, among the various techniques, we focused
on the details of association rule mining, classification, and clustering. We pre-
sented algorithms in each of these areas and illustrated with examples of how those
algorithms work.

A variety of other techniques, including the AI-based neural networks and genetic
algorithms, were also briefly discussed. Active research is ongoing in data mining,
and we have outlined some of the expected research directions. In the future data-
base technology products market, a great deal of data mining activity is expected.
We summarized 11 out of several hundred data mining tools available; future
research is expected to extend the number and functionality significantly.

Review Questions
