If instructions and data reside in the same cache unit, only one instruction can
proceed and the other instruction is delayed. Many processors use separate
instruction and data caches to avoid this delay.
An example of a structural hazard is shown in Figure. This figure shows how the
load instruction
Load X(R1),R2
> The memory address, X+[R1], is computed in stepE2 in cycle 4, then memory
access takes place in cycle 5. The operand read from memory is written into
register R2 in cycle 6. This means that the execution step of this instruction
takes two clock cycles (cycles 4 and 5). It causes the pipeline to stall for one
cycle, because both instructions I2 and I3 require access to the register file
in cycle 6.
> Even though the instructions and their data are all available, the pipeline is
stalled because one hardware resource, the register file, cannot handle two
operations at once. If the register file had two input ports, that is, if it allowed
two simultaneous write operations, the pipeline would not be stalled. In
general, structural hazards are avoided by providing sufficient hardware
resources on the processor chip.

Figure 8.5 Effect of a Load instruction on pipeline timing

It is important to understand that pipelining does not result in
individual instructions being executed faster; rather, it is the
throughput that increases, where throughput is measured by the rate
at which instruction execution is completed.

The pipeline stalls, causes degradation in pipeline performance.

We need to identify all hazards that may cause the pipeline to stall
and to find ways to minimize their impact.
