Microcontrollers — BCS402

A coprocessor can either provide additional computation capability or be used to control the

memory subsystem including caches and memory management.

The coprocessor instructions include data processing, register transfer, and memory transfer

instructions.

Note that these instructions are only used by cores with a coprocessor.

Syntax: CDP {<cond>} cp, opcodel, Cd, Cn {, opcode2}
<MRCIMCR>{<cond>} cp, opcodel, Rd, Cn, Cm {, opcode2}

<LDCISTC>{<cond>} cp, Cd, addressing

CDP coprocessor data processing—perform an operation in a coprocessor

MRC MCR | coprocessor register transfer—move data to/from coprocessor registers

LDC STC | coprocessor memory transfer—load and store blocks of memory to/from a coprocessor

In the syntax of the coprocessor instructions, the cp field represents the coprocessor number
between pO and p15. The opcode fields describe the operation to take place on the

coprocessor. The Cn, Cm, and Cd fields describe registers within the coprocessor.

The coprocessor operations and registers depend on the specific coprocessor that being used.
Coprocessor 15 (CPI5) is reserved for system control purposes, such as memory

management, write buffer control, cache control, and identification registers.
Example:
MRC p15,0,r10,cO, cO, 0 ; transferring the contents of CP15 register c0 to register rl10

Here CP15 register-O0 contains the processor identification number. This register is copied

into the general-purpose register r10.

6. Loading Constants

There is no ARM instruction to move a 32-bit constant into a register. Since ARM

instructions are 32 bits in size, they obviously cannot specify a general 32-bit constant.

To aid programming there are two pseudo instructions to move a 32-bit value into a register
