Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

Interfaces for Parametric Users. Parametric users, such as bank tellers, often
have a small set of operations that they must perform repeatedly. For example, a
teller is able to use single function keys to invoke routine and repetitive transactions
such as account deposits or withdrawals, or balance inquiries. Systems analysts and
programmers design and implement a special interface for each known class of
naive users. Usually a small set of abbreviated commands is included, with the goal
of minimizing the number of keystrokes required for each request.

Interfaces for the DBA. Most database systems contain privileged commands
that can be used only by the DBA staff. These include commands for creating
accounts, setting system parameters, granting account authorization, changing a
schema, and reorganizing the storage structures of a database.

2.4 The Database System Environment

A DBMS is a complex software system. In this section we discuss the types of soft-
ware components that constitute a DBMS and the types of computer system soft-
ware with which the DBMS interacts.

2.4.1 DBMS Component Modules

Figure 2.3 illustrates, in a simplified form, the typical DBMS components. The
figure is divided into two parts. The top part of the figure refers to the various
users of the database environment and their interfaces. The lower part shows the
internal modules of the DBMS responsible for storage of data and processing of
transactions.

The database and the DBMS catalog are usually stored on disk. Access to the
disk is controlled primarily by the operating system (OS), which schedules disk
read/write. Many DBMSs have their own buffer management module to sched-
ule disk read/write, because management of buffer storage has a considerable
effect on performance. Reducing disk read/write improves performance consid-
erably. A higher-level stored data manager module of the DBMS controls access
to DBMS information that is stored on disk, whether it is part of the database or
the catalog.

Let us consider the top part of Figure 2.3 first. It shows interfaces for the DBA staff,
casual users who work with interactive interfaces to formulate queries, application
programmers who create programs using some host programming languages, and
parametric users who do data entry work by supplying parameters to predefined
transactions. The DBA staff works on defining the database and tuning it by mak-
ing changes to its definition using the DDL and other privileged commands.

The DDL compiler processes schema definitions, specified in the DDL, and stores
descriptions of the schemas (meta-data) in the DBMS catalog. The catalog includes
information such as the names and sizes of files, names and data types of data items,
storage details of each file, mapping information among schemas, and constraints.
