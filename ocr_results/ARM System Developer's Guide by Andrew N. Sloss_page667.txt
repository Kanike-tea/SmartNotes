D.3 ARM9TDMI INSTRUCTION CYCLE TIMINGS

The ARM9TDMI core is based on a five-stage pipeline with a single execute stage and two
memory fetch stages. There is usually a one- or two-cycle delay following a load instruction
before you can use the data. Using data immediately after a load will add interlock cycles.
The multiplier circuit uses a 32-bit by 8-bit multiplier array with early termination. The
number of multiply iteration cycles M depends on the value of register Rs according to
Table D.5. Table D.6 gives the ARM9TDMI instruction cycle timings.
