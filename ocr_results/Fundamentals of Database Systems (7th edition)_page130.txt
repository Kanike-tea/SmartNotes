e. List concisely the user requirements that led to this ER schema design.

f. Suppose that every customer must have at least one account but is
restricted to at most two loans at a time, and that a bank branch cannot
have more than 1,000 loans. How does this show up on the (min, max)
constraints?

Consider the ER diagram in Figure 3.23. Assume that an employee may
work in up to two departments or may not be assigned to any department.
Assume that each department must have one and may have up to three
phone numbers. Supply (min, max) constraints on this diagram. State clearly
any additional assumptions you make. Under what conditions would the
relationship HAS_PHONE be redundant in this example?

Consider the ER diagram in Figure 3.24. Assume that a course may or may
not use a textbook, but that a text by definition is a book that is used in some
course. A course may not use more than five books. Instructors teach from
two to four courses. Supply (min, max) constraints on this diagram. State
clearly any additional assumptions you make. If we add the relationship
ADOPTS, to indicate the textbook(s) that an instructor uses for a course,
should it be a binary relationship between INSTRUCTOR and TEXT, or a
ternary relationship among all three entity types? What (min, max) con-
straints would you put on the relationship? Why?
