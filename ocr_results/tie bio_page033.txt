As per above figure, human skin has evolved into a complex structure with epidermis and
dermis forming a major part and subcutaneous tissue forming the third region. Such a
structure serves to protect the body from exposure to UV rays, prevents drying of skin as
well as acts as barrier preventing the entry of toxins, pathogens etc. to the body. Skin is
also known as first line of defense in the immune system.

The whole process of skin bioprinting consists of four major steps; the first of which
includes cell and biomaterials selection. This process is known as pre-processing, and is
followed by the actual printing process. The printing process is followed by post-
processing step that includes cell proliferation and maturation of printed skin construct.
The final step in human skin bioprinting is the characterization of the printed tissue and
its functional evaluation. The cells for printing process are obtained from skin biopsy, and
then these are expanded via cell culture methods. The bio-ink is prepared by an
amalgamation of cells and supporting biomaterials.

The cells for bioprinting can be either primary cell, if the donor has healthy skin, or they
can be stem cells if the donor has injured skin. Stem cell sources can differ on a case to
case basis and range from adipose to mesenchymal as well as prenatal cells. Clinical
images of the damaged area can be obtained by imaging techniques such as nuclear
imaging techniques like PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc. These images can
then be used as input to design anatomically accurate models of the functional tissue in
the form of STL files using CAD/CAM graphic interphase.

The STL model can then be sliced into layers that characterize the boundary and features
of each slice that is then used to create path for bioprinter heads. The bioprinter reads the
STL file in a layered fashion for deposition of the bio-ink. The thickness of these slices
usually lies in the range of 100-500 «um for the inkjet and extrusion based bioprinters,
while laser assisted bioprinters have a resolution of 20-100 pm. It is important to note
that printing resolutions below 100 um provide precise patterning of cell-laden constructs
in tissue models. High-quality image acquisition from clinical imaging is a prerequisite
