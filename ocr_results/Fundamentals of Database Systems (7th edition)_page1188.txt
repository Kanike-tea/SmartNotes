WR_SAL (WR Sales). He cannot access row 1 because he does not have the CHEM
(Chemical) compartment. It is important that a user has authorization for all com-
partments in a row’s data label so the user can access that row. Based on this exam-
ple, user 2 can access both rows 3 and 4 and has a maximum level of S, which is less
than the HS in row 2. So, although user 2 has access to the FIN compartment, he
can only access the group WR_SAL and thus cannot access row 1.

30.11 Summary

In this chapter, we discussed several techniques for enforcing database system
security. Section 30.1 is an introduction to database security. We presented in Sec-
tion 30.1.1 different threats to databases in terms of loss of integrity, availability,
and confidentiality. We discussed in Section 30.1.2 the types of control measures
to deal with these problems: access control, inference control, flow control, and
encryption. In the rest of Section 30.1, we covered various issues related to secu-
rity, including data sensitivity and type of disclosures; security versus precision of
results when a user requests information; and the relationship between informa-
tion security and privacy.

Security enforcement deals with controlling access to the database system as a
whole and controlling authorization to access specific portions of a database. The
former is usually done by assigning accounts with passwords to users. The latter
can be accomplished by using a system of granting and revoking privileges to
individual accounts for accessing specific parts of the database. This approach,
