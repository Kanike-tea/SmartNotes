Object and Object-Relational
Databases

n this chapter, we discuss the features of object-

oriented data models and show how some of these
features have been incorporated in relational database systems and the SQL standard.
Some features of object data models have also been incorporated into the data mod-
els of newer types of database systems, known as NOSQL systems (see Chapter 24).
In addition, the XML model (see Chapter 13) has similarities to the object model.
So an introduction to the object model will give a good perspective on many of the
recent advances in database technology. Database systems that were based on the
object data model were known originally as object-oriented databases (OODBs) but
are now referred to as object databases (ODBs).Traditional data models and sys-
tems, such as network, hierarchical, and relational have been quite successful in
developing the database technologies required for many traditional business data-
base applications. However, they have certain shortcomings when more complex
database applications must be designed and implemented—for example, databases
for engineering design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM and CIM!), biological and
other sciences, telecommunications, geographic information systems, and multi-
media.” These ODBs were developed for applications that have requirements
requiring more complex structures for stored objects. A key feature of object data-
bases is the power they give the designer to specify both the structure of complex
objects and the operations that can be applied to these objects.

graphics, and documents (see Chapter 26).
