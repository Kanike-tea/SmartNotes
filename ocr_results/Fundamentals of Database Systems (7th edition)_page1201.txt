Overview of the QBE
Language

T* Query-By-Example (QBE) language is impor-
tant because it is one of the first graphical query
languages with minimum syntax developed for database systems. It was developed
at IBM Research and is available as an IBM commercial product as part of the QMF
(Query Management Facility) interface option to DB2. The language was also
implemented in the Paradox DBMS, and is related to a point-and-click type inter-
face in the Microsoft Access DBMS. It differs from SQL in that the user does not
have to explicitly specify a query using a fixed syntax; rather, the query is formulated
by filling in templates of relations that are displayed on a monitor screen. Figure C.1
shows how these templates may look for the database of Figure 3.5. The user does
not have to remember the names of attributes or relations because they are dis-
played as part of these templates. Additionally, the user does not have to follow rigid
syntax rules for query specification; rather, constants and variables are entered in
the columns of the templates to construct an example related to the retrieval or
update request. QBE is related to the domain relational calculus, as we shall see, and
its original specification has been shown to be relationally complete.

C.1 Basic Retrievals in QBE

In QBE retrieval queries are specified by filling in one or more rows in the templates
of the tables. For a single relation query, we enter either constants or example
elements (a QBE term) in the columns of the template of that relation. An example
element stands for a domain variable and is specified as an example value preceded
by the underscore character (_). Additionally, a P. prefix (called the P dot operator)
is entered in certain columns to indicate that we would like to print (or display)
