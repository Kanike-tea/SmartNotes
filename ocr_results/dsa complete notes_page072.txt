Consider the polynomials a = 3x!* + 2x® + 1x+2 and b = 8x!?- 3x!° + 10x5 +3 It can be represented as
follows

a »[3] 14 > [2/8 >[1]1 >
b >| 8 | 12 >|} 3} 10 >| 10) 5 >| 3/0
Adding Polynomials

To add two polynomials, we examine their terms starting at the NODEs pointed to by a and b.
1. Ifa—expon = b—expon, we add the two coefficients a—coef + b—coef and create a new
term for the result c. a = a—link; b = blink;
2. Ifa—expon < b—expon, then we create a duplicate term of b, attach this term to the
result,called c, and b = b—link;
3. Ifa—expon > b—expon, then we create a duplicate term of a, attach this term to the result,

called c, and a = a—link;
