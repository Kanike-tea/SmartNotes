Show that the transformation w = z-i/1-iz maps the unit circle with centre
origin in the'z-plane onto the real axis in the w-plane.

Prove that w = 1+2/1-z maps the region | z |

Given w= z-i/iz-1, show that the unit circle with centre origin in the
w-plane is mapped onto the imaginary axis in the z-plane.
