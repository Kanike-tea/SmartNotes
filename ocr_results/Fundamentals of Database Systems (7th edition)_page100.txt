Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

be specified in UML class diagrams (see Section 3.8) and in other diagrammatic
notations used in database design tools. Additional data types to represent common
database types, such as date, time, and other concepts, are also employed.

Mathematically, an attribute A of entity set E whose value set is V can be defined as
a function from E to the power set® P(V) of V:

A:E- P(V)

We refer to the value of attribute A for entity e as A(e). The previous definition cov-
ers both single-valued and multivalued attributes, as well as NULLs. A NULL value
is represented by the empty set. For single-valued attributes, A(e) is restricted to
being a singleton set for each entity e in E, whereas there is no restriction on multi-
valued attributes.’ For a composite attribute A, the value set V is the power set of
the Cartesian product of P(V;), P(V3),..., P(V,), where V;, Vz,..., V,, are the
value sets of the simple component attributes that form A:

V=P(P(V,) x P(V2) x- ++ x P(V;,))

The value set provides all possible values. Usually only a small number of these val-
ues exist in the database at a particular time. Those values represent the data from
the current state of the miniworld and correspond to the data as it actually exists in
the miniworld.

3.3.3 Initial Conceptual Design of the COMPANY Database

We can now define the entity types for the COMPANY database, based on the
requirements described in Section 3.2. After defining several entity types and their
attributes here, we refine our design in Section 3.4 after we introduce the concept of
a relationship. According to the requirements listed in Section 3.2, we can identify
four entity types—one corresponding to each of the four items in the specification
(see Figure 3.8):

1. An entity type DEPARTMENT with attributes Name, Number, Locations,
Manager, and Manager_start_date. Locations is the only multivalued attribute.
We can specify that both Name and Number are (separate) key attributes
because each was specified to be unique.

v

. An entity type PROJECT with attributes Name, Number, Location, and
Controlling_department. Both Name and Number are (separate) key attributes.

An entity type EMPLOYEE with attributes Name, Ssn, Sex, Address, Salary,
Birth_date, Department, and Supervisor. Both Name and Address may be
composite attributes; however, this was not specified in the requirements.
We must go back to the users to see if any of them will refer to the individual
components of Name—First_name, Middle_initial, Last_name—or of Address. In
