Database Management System [BCS403]

Data independence occurs because when the schema is changed at some level, the schema
at the next higher level remains unchanged; only the mapping between the two levels is

changed.

2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces
The DBMS must provide appropriate languages and interfaces for each category of
users.
DBMS Languages
Once the design of a database is completed and a DBMS is chosen to implement the
database, the first step is to specify conceptual and internal schemas for the database and any

mappings between the two.

Data Definition Language (DDL)

Storage Definition Language (SDL)

Storage definition language is used when clear separation is maintained between the
conceptual and internal levels, the DDL is used to specify the conceptual schema only.

The storage definition language (SDL), is used to specify the internal schema. The

mappings between the two schemas may be specified in either one of these languages.
