Database Recovery Techniques

n this chapter, we discuss some of the techniques that

can be used for database recovery in case of system
failure. In Section 20.1.4 we discussed the different causes of failure, such as system.
crashes and transaction errors. In Section 20.2, we introduced some of the concepts
that are used by recovery processes, such as the system log and commit points.

This chapter presents additional concepts that are relevant to recovery protocols
and provides an overview of the various database recovery algorithms. We start
in Section 22.1 with an outline of a typical recovery procedure and a categoriza-
tion of recovery algorithms, and then we discuss several recovery concepts,
including write-ahead logging, in-place versus shadow updates, and the process
of rolling back (undoing) the effect of an incomplete or failed transaction. In Sec-
tion 22.2, we present recovery techniques based on deferred update, also known
as the NO-UNDO/REDO technique, where the data on disk is not updated until
after a transaction commits. In Section 22.3, we discuss recovery techniques based
on immediate update, where data can be updated on disk during transaction exe-
cution; these include the UNDO/REDO and UNDO/NO-REDO algorithms. In Sec-
tion 22.4, we discuss the technique known as shadowing or shadow paging, which
can be categorized as a NO-UNDO/NO-REDO algorithm. An example of a practical
DBMS recovery scheme, called ARIES, is presented in Section 22.5. Recovery in
multidatabases is briefly discussed in Section 22.6. Finally, techniques for recov-
ery from catastrophic failure are discussed in Section 22.7. Section 22.8 summa-
rizes the chapter.

Our emphasis is on conceptually describing several different approaches to recov-
ery. For descriptions of recovery features in specific systems, the reader should con-
sult the bibliographic notes at the end of the chapter and the online and printed
user manuals for those systems. Recovery techniques are often intertwined with the
concurrency control mechanisms. Certain recovery techniques are best used with
