ARM core dataflow model.

instructions copy data from registers to memory. There are no data processing instructions
that directly manipulate data in memory. Thus, data processing is carried out solely in
registers.

Data items are placed in the register file—a storage bank made up of 32-bit registers.
Since the ARM core is a 32-bit processor, most instructions treat the registers as holding
signed or unsigned 32-bit values. The sign extend hardware converts signed 8-bit and 16-bit
numbers to 32-bit values as they are read from memory and placed in a register.

ARM instructions typically have two source registers, Rn and Rm, anda single result or
destination register, Rd. Source operands are read from the register file using the internal
buses A and B, respectively.

The ALU (arithmetic logic unit) or MAC (multiply-accumulate unit) takes the regis-
ter values Rn and Rm from the A and B buses and computes a result. Data processing
instructions write the result in Rd directly to the register file. Load and store instructions
use the ALU to generate an address to be held in the address register and broadcast on the
Address bus.
