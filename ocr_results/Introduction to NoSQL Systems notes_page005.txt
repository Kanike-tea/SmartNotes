4. Example Document and Query in MongoDB

A sample MongoDB document for a user might look like:

json
CopyEdit
{

"id": 101,

"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john@example.com",
"address": {
"street": "123 Main St",
"city": "New York",
"zip": "10001"
1,
“orders”: [
{"item": "Laptop", "price": 999.99},
{"item": "Mouse", "price": 25.00}
]
}

This document stores all relevant information about the user in one place. To query all
users who have ordered a "Laptop", you'd use:

javascript
CopyEdit
db.users.find({"orders.item": "Laptop"});

This returns all documents where the nested orders array includes an item called
"Laptop".
