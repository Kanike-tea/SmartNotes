Eye as a Camera System:
The human eye can be analogized to a camera system, as both the eye and a camera capture light and
convert it into an image. The main components of the eye that correspond to a camera system include:
e The Cornea: This transparent outer layer of the eye functions like a camera lens, bending light
to focus it onto the retina.
e The Iris: The iris functions like the diaphragm in a camera, controlling the amount of light that
enters the eye.
e The Pupil: The pupil functions like the aperture in a camera, adjusting the size to control the
amount of light entering the eye.
e The Retina: The retina functions like the camera film or sensor, capturing the light and
converting it into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.
e The Optic Nerve: The optic nerve functions like the cable connecting the camera to a computer,
transmitting the electrical signals from the retina to the brain.

In both the eye and a camera, the captured light is transformed into an image by the lens and the
light-sensitive component. The eye processes the image further, allowing for visual perception,
while a camera stores the image for later use.

It's important to note that the eye is much more complex than a camera and has several additional
functions, such as adjusting for different levels of light and adjusting focus, that are

not found in a camera. The eye also has the ability to perceive depth and colour, as well as adjust
to movements and provide a continuous, real-time image to the brain.
