Database Management System [BCS403]

subsystem is responsible for making sure that the database is restored to the state it was in
before the transaction started executing. Disk backup is also necessary in case of a catastrophic

disk failure.

6. Providing Multiple User Interfaces
Because many types of users with varying levels of technical knowledge use a database, a

DBMS should provide a variety of user interfaces. These include

e Query languages for casual users
e Programming language interfaces for application programmers
e Forms and command codes for parametric users

e Menu-driven interfaces and natural language interfaces for standalone users.

7. Representing Complex Relationships among Data
A database may include numerous varieties of data that are interrelated in many ways.
For example each section record <is related to one course record and to a number of
GRADE_REPORT records—one for each student who completed that section. A DBMS must
have the capability to represent a variety of complex relationships among the data, to define
new relationships as they arise, and to retrieve and update related data easily and efficiently.

8. Enforcing Integrity Constraints

Most database applications are such that the semantics of the data require that it satisfy certain

restrictions in order to make sense.
The simplest type of integrity constraint involves specifying a data type for each data item.

For example, in student table we specified that the value of Name must be a string of no more

than 30 alphabetic characters.

More complex type of constraint is referential integrity involves specifying that a record in
one file must be related to records in other files. For example, in university database, we can

specify that every section record must be related to a course record.

Another type of constraint specifies uniqueness on data item values, such as every course
record must have a unique value for Course_number. This is known as a key or uniqueness

constraint.
