D. Detoxification

¢ Liver enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450) help detoxify harmful substances.

E. Industrial & Medical Applications

¢ Used in food processing (e.g., lactase for lactose-free milk), pharmaceuticals (e.g.,
proteases in wound healing), and biotechnology (e.g., PCR enzymes in genetic

research).

Enzymes are essential for life, enabling biological processes to occur efficiently and under

controlled conditions.

Engineering Applications of Enzymes

1. Bioremediation: Enzymes are used to break down pollutants in the environment, such
as oils, pesticides, and toxic waste.

2. Biofuel production: Enzymes are used to convert plant material into biofuels, such
as ethanol and biodiesel.

3. Food and beverage production: Enzymes are widely used in the food and beverage
industry for processes such as baking, brewing, cheese making, and juice production.

4. Textile production: Enzymes are used to remove stains, whiten fabrics, and improve
the softness of textiles.

5. Detergents: Enzymes are used in laundry detergents to break down protein, starch,
and lipid stains.

6. Pharmaceuticals: Enzymes are used in the production of various pharmaceutical
products, such as antibiotics and vaccines.

7. Research and biotechnology: Enzymes are used as tools in genetic engineering,

protein engineering, and molecular biology.

Hormones: Properties & Functions

1. Definition of Hormones

Hormones are biochemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands that regulate
physiological processes in the body. They travel through the bloodstream to target organs,

where they bind to specific receptors and trigger responses.
