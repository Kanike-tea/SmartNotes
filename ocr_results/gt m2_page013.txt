2-10. TRAVELING-SALESMAN PROBLEM

A problem closely related to the question of Hamiltonian circuits is the
traveling-salesman problem, stated as follows: A salesman is required to visit a
number of cities during a trip. Given the distances between the cities, in what
order should he travel so as to visit every city precisely once and return home,
with the minimum mileage traveled?

Representing the cities by vertices and the roads between them by edges, we
get a graph. In this graph, with every edge e; there is associated a real number
(the distance in miles, say), w(e;). Such a graph is called a weighted graph; w(e;)
being the weight of edge e;..

In our problem, if each of the cities has a road to every other city, we have a
complete weighted graph. This graph has numerous Hamiltonian circuits, and we
are to pick the one that has the smallest sum of distances (or weights).

The total number of different (not edge disjoint, of course) Hamiltonian
circuits in a complete graph of n vertices can be shown to be (n — 1)!/2. This
follows from the fact that starting from any vertex we have n — 1 edges to choose
from the first vertex, n — 2 from the second, n — 3 from the third, and so on.
These being independent choices, we get (n — 1)! possible number of choices.
This number is, however, divided by 2, because each Hamiltonian circuit has
been counted twice.

Theoretically, the problem of the traveling salesman can always be solved by
enumerating all (n — 1)!/2 Hamiltonian circuits, calculating the distance traveled
in each, and then picking the shortest one. However, for a large value of n, the
labor involved is too great even for a digital computer (try solving it for the 50
state capitals in the United States; n = 50).

The problem is to prescribe a manageable algorithm for finding the shortest
route. No efficient algorithm for problems of arbitrary size has yet been found,
although many attempts have been made. Since this problem has applications in
operations research, some specific large-scale examples have been worked out
(see [2-1]). There are also available several heuristic methods of solution that
give a route very close to the shortest one, but do not guarantee the shortest (see
[2-4] for such a method).
