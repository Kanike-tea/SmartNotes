LAB PROGRAM 02 (b)

2 b) Develop a python program to convert binary to decimal, octal to hexadecimal using
functions.

Aim: Demonstrating creation of functions, passing parameters and return values

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

The below program provides two functions: binary_to_decimal and octal_to_hexadecimal,
which perform conversions between different number systems. Let's go through the program and

its functions step by step:

1. The binary_to_decimal function takes a binary number as input and converts it to
decimal. It initializes two variables: decimal to store the decimal value, and power to
keep track of the current power of 2.

2. Inside the while loop, the function performs the conversion by extracting the rightmost
digit of the binary number using the modulo operator (%) and multiplying it by the
appropriate power of 2. The resulting value is added to the decimal variable. The binary
number is then divided by 10 (integer division) to remove the rightmost digit, and the
power is incremented by 1.

3. Once the entire binary number has been processed (when binary becomes 0), the function
returns the calculated decimal value.

4. The octal_to_hexadecimal function takes an octal number as input and converts it to
hexadecimal. It follows a similar approach to the previous function. It initializes decimal
and power, and then performs the conversion by multiplying the rightmost digit of the
octal number by the appropriate power of 8.

5. After converting the octal number to decimal, the function initializes an empty string
hexadecimal to store the hexadecimal representation. It also defines the string hex_digits
containing the hexadecimal digits from 0 to F.

6. The function then enters another while loop to convert the decimal number to
hexadecimal. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of the decimal number divided
by 16 using the modulo operator. It uses this remainder to retrieve the corresponding
hexadecimal digit from hex_digits and appends it to the hexadecimal string.

7. Finally, the decimal number is divided by 16 (integer division) to remove the least

significant digit, and the loop continues until the decimal number becomes 0.

8. The function returns the resulting hexadecimal string.
