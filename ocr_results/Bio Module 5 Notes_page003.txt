The basic steps in this process are as follows:

e Harvesting of muscle cells: Muscle cells are typically obtained from the patient and then
isolated and expanded in culture.

e Seeding onto scaffold: The muscle cells are then seeded onto a scaffold, such as a
hydrogel or artificial matrix. The scaffold provides a framework for the cells to grow and
differentiate into new tissue.

e Cell differentiation and tissue formation: Once the cells are seeded onto the scaffold, they
undergo differentiation, in which they change into specific cell types, such as muscle
cells or heart cells. The cells also begin to organize and form new tissue, such as heart
tissue or skeletal muscle tissue.

e Implantation into patient: The scaffold and cells are then implanted into the patient to
promote the growth of new, functional tissue.

3.1.3 Muscle Cells as Scaffold

Muscle cells can be used as a scaffold for tissue generation by removing the living cells
from the muscle tissue, leaving behind the structure known as the extracellular matrix (ECM).
This decellularized muscle scaffold provides a framework that can guide and support the growth
of new tissues.
