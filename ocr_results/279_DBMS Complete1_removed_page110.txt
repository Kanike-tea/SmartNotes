Data staging area is the storage area as well as set of ETL process that extract data from source
system. It is everything between source systems and Data warehouse.

Data staging are never be used for reporting purpose. Data is extracted from source system and
stored, cleansed, transformed in staging area to load into data warehouse.

Staging are not necessarily the DBMS. It could be flat files also. Staging area can be structured like
normalized source systems. It totally depends on choice and need of development process.

Data Presentation Area

Data presentation area is generally called as data warehouse. It’s the place where cleaned,
transformed data is stored in a dimensionally structured warehouse and made available for analysis
purpose

Data Access Tools

once data is available in presentation area it is accessed using data access tools like Business
Objects.

Schema:

(Star schema)

The star schema architecture is the simplest data warehouse schema. It is called a star schema
because the diagram resembles a star, with points radiating from a center. The center of the star
consists of fact table and the points of the star are the dimension tables. Usually the fact tables in a
star schema are in third normal form(3NF) whereas dimensional tables are de-normalized. Despite
the fact that the star schema is the simplest architecture, it is most commonly used nowadays and is
recommended by Oracle.

Fact Tables

A fact table typically has two types of columns: foreign keys to dimension tables and measures
those that contain numeric facts. A fact table can contain fact's data on detail or aggregated level.

> Dimension Tables

A dimension is a structure usually composed of one or more hierarchies that categorizes data. If a
imension hasn't got a hierarchies and levels it is called flat dimension or list. The primary keys of
each of the dimension tables are part of the composite primary key of the fact table. Dimensional
attributes help to describe the dimensional value. They are normally descriptive, textual values.
Dimension tables are generally small in size then fact table.

Typical fact tables store data about sales while dimension tables data about geographic
region(markets, cities) , clients, products, times, channels.

The main characteristics of star schema:

1. Simple structure -> easy to understand schema

2. Great query effectives -> small number of tables to join

3. Relatively long time of loading data into dimension tables -> de-normalization,
redundancy data caused that size of the table could be large.

4. The most commonly used in the data warehouse implementations -> widely
supported by a large number of business intelligence tools
