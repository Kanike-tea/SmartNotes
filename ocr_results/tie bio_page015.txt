7. Define ECG. Briefly explain the design of stent in coronary artery.
Answer:

Electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick and easily accessible method for diagnosis and
screening of cardiovascular diseases including heart failure (HF). Artificial intelligence
(AD) can be used for semi-automated ECG analysis. The aim of this evaluation was to provide
an overview of AI use in HF detection from ECG signals and to perform a meta-analysis of
available studies.

A stent is a tiny tube that can play a big role in treating your heart disease. It helps keep your
arteries -- the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to other parts of your body,
including the heart muscle itself -- open.

Most stents are made out of wire mesh and are permanent. Some are made out of fabric.
These are called stent grafts and are often used for larger arteries.

Others are made of a material that dissolves and that your body absorbs over time. They're
coated in medicine that slowly releases into your artery to prevent it from being blocked
again.

If a fatty substance called plaque builds up inside an artery, it can reduce blood flow to your
heart. This is called coronary heart disease and it can cause chest pain.

The plaque can also cause a blood clot that blocks blood flowing to your heart, which may
lead to a heart attack.

By keeping an artery open, stents lower your risk of chest pain. They can also treat a heart
attack that's in progress. Doctor usually inserts a stent using a minimally invasive procedure.
They will make a small incision and use a catheter to guide specialized tools through your
blood vessels to reach the area that needs a stent. This incision is usually in the groin or arm.
One of those tools may have a camera on the end to help your doctor guide the stent. During
the procedure, doctor may also use an imaging technique called an angiogram to help guide
the stent through the vessel.

Using the necessary tools, doctor will locate the broken or blocked vessel and install the
stent. Then they will remove the instruments from your body and close the incision.

8. Briefly explain about pacemakers and Defibrillators.
Answer:

Pacemakers:

A pacemaker is a small device that's placed (implanted) in the chest to help control the
heartbeat. It's used to prevent the heart from beating too slowly. Implanting a pacemaker in
the chest requires a surgical procedure. A pacemaker is also called a cardiac pacing device.
Types:

Single chamber pacemaker. This type usually carries electrical impulses to the right ventricle
of your heart.
