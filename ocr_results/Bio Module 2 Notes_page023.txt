Enzymes Used in Biosensors

Enzymes are commonly used in biosensors as the biological recognition element. Here are

some examples of enzymes used in biosensors:

Glucose oxidase (GOx): Used in blood glucose monitoring for people with diabetes.
The enzyme oxidizes glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which is then
detected by a transducer to quantify glucose levels in the blood.

Lactate oxidase (LOx): Used in the determination of lactate levels in biological fluids,
such as blood and urine. LOx oxidizes lactate to pyruvate, which is then detected by a
transducer.

Cholinesterase (ChE): Used in the detection of organophosphorus pesticides and
nerve agents. ChE hydrolyzes acetylcholine, and the decrease in acetylcholine levels
is detected by a transducer to quantify the presence of the toxic substances.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP): Used in the detection of inorganic phosphates, such as
those found in wastewater and fertilizers. ALP catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphates
to produce a signal that can be quantified.

Urease: Used in the detection of urea levels in biological fluids, such as urine. Urease

catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonium and carbon dioxide, which can be

quantified by a transducer. These are just a few examples of the many enzymes that can be

used in biosensors to detect and quantify a wide range of target analytes.

Advantages of Biosensors

Sensitivity: Biosensors are highly sensitive and can detect target analytes at low
concentrations, making them useful in applications that require precise quantification.
Specificity: Biosensors can be designed to specifically recognize a target analyte,
which minimizes interference from other substances in the sample.

Rapid response time: Biosensors can provide results in real-time, making them useful
in situations where quick results are required.

Portability: Biosensors can be designed to be small and portable, making them useful
in field applications and remote locations.

Cost-effectiveness: Biosensors can be manufactured at a low cost, making them an

attractive alternative to more expensive analytical methods in some applications.
