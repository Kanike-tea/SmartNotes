MODULE 5:
Basic Processing Unit and Pipelining

Basic Processing Unit: Some Fundamental Concepts: Register Transfers, Performing ALU
operations, fetching a word from Memory, Storing a word in memory. Execution of a Complete
Instruction.

Pipelining: Basic concepts, Role of Cache memory, Pipeline Performance.

SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

The processing unit which executes machine instructions and coordinates
the activities of other units of computer is called the Instruction Set
Processor (ISP) or processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU).

The primary function of a processor is to execute the instructions stored
in memory. Instructions are fetched from successive memory locations
and executed in processor, until a branch instruction occurs.

To execute an instruction, processor has to perform following 3 steps:

1. Fetch contents of memory-location pointed to by PC. Content of this
location isan instruction to be executed. The instructions are loaded
into IR, Symbolically, this operation is written as:
IR € [[PC]]

2. Increment PC by
4.PC €[PC] +4

3. Carry out the actions specified by instruction (in the IR).

The steps 1 and 2 are referred to as Fetch Phase.
Step 3 is referred to as Execution Phase.

SINGLE BUS ORGANIZATION

«Here the processor contain only a single bus for the movement of data,
address andinstructions.
«ALU and all the registers are interconnected via a Single Common Bus
(Figure 7.1).
«Data & address lines of the external memory-bus is connected to
the internal processor-bus via MDR & MAR respectively.
(MDR -> Memory Data Register, MAR -> Memory Address Register).
¢MDR has 2 inputs and 2 outputs. Data may be loaded
— into MDR either from memory-bus (external) or
— from processor-bus (internal).
¢MAR’s input is connected to internal-bus; MAR's output is connected to
external- bus. (address sent from processor to memory only)
