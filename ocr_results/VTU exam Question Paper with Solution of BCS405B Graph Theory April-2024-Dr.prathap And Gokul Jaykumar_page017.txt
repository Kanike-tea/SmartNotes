Fig. 9-19 Digraph and its adjacency matrix.

Pp

X is a symmetric matrix if and only if G is a symmetric digraph.

2. Every nonzero element on the main diagonal represents a self-loop at the
corresponding vertex.

3. There is no way of showing parallel edges in X. This is why the adjacency
matrix is defined only for a digraph without parallel edges.

4. The sum of each row equals the out-degree of the corresponding vertex,
and the sum of each column equals the in-degree of the corresponding
vertex. The number of nonzero entries in X equals the number of edges in
G.

5. Permutation of any two rows accompanied by a permutation of the

corresponding columns does not alter the graph. The permutation merely
corresponds to a reordering of the vertices. Thus two digraphs are
isomorphic if and only if their adjacency matrices differ only by such
permutations.

6. If X is the adjacency matrix of a digraph G, then the transposed matrix X?
is the adjacency matrix of a digraph G® obtained by reversing the direction
of every edge in G.

7. For any square (0, 1)-matrix Q of order n, there exists a unique digraph G
of n vertices, such that Q is the adjacency matrix of G.

The incidence matrix can be obtained in a similar way by replacing
columns by edges.
