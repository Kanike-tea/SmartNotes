2) Multiple Bus Structure
> Systems that contain multiple buses achieve more concurrency in operations.

> Two or more transfers can be carried out at the same time.
> Advantage: Better performance.

> Disadvantage: Increased cost.

Figure 1.3 Single-bus structure.

¢ The devices connected to a bus vary widely in their speed of operation.

¢ To synchronize their operational-speed, buffer-registers can be used.

¢ Buffer Registers
— are included with the devices to hold the information during transfers.
— prevent a high-speed processor from being locked to a slow I/O device during data
transfers.

PERFORMANCE
¢ The most important measure of performance of a computer is how quickly it can execute programs.
¢ The speed of a computer is affected by the design of
1) Instruction-set.
2) Hardware & the technology in which the hardware is implemented.
3) Software including the operating system.
¢ Because programs are usually written in a HLL, performance is also affected by the compiler
that translates programs into machine language. (HLL High Level Language).
¢ For best performance, it is necessary to design the compiler, machine instruction set and hardware in
a co-ordinated way.

Figure 1.5 The processor cache.
Let examine the flow of program instructions and data between the memory & the processor.
At the start of execution, all program instructions are stored in the main-memory.
As execution proceeds, instructions are fetched into the processor, and a copy is placed in the cache.
¢ Later, if the same instruction is needed a second time, it is read directly from the cache.
¢ A program will be executed faster
if movement of instruction/data between the main-memory and the processor is minimized which
is achieved by using the cache.
