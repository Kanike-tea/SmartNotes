Selective: Microorganisms can be selected based on their ability to remove specific heavy
metals, which allows for the removal of specific contaminants in a targeted manner.

Effective: Microorganisms can effectively remove high levels of heavy metals from
contaminated environments or ore deposits, making this process a useful tool for
environmental remediation and mining.

Sustainability: The microorganisms used in bioremediation and biomining can be
cultured and reused, making the process sustainable over the long term.

Limitations of Bioremediation and Biomining

Slow process: The process of removing heavy metals via microbial surface adsorption
can be slow, as it may take several months or even years for the microorganisms to
adsorb the heavy metals.

Incomplete removal: While microbial surface adsorption is effective in removing high
levels of heavy metals, it may not be able to remove all of the contaminants, leaving
some heavy metals behind.

Microbial inhibition: Some environmental conditions, such as high levels of other heavy
metals or low pH, can inhibit the growth and activity of the microorganisms, reducing
their ability to remove heavy metals.

Difficulty in harvesting: Harvesting the microorganisms that have adsorbed the heavy
metals can be difficult, as the microorganisms may form dense biofilms or be difficult to
separate from the contaminated environment or ore deposit.

Limited application: The effectiveness of microbial surface adsorption for removing
heavy metals is limited by the ability of the microorganisms to adsorb specific heavy
metals. Some heavy metals, such as mercury, may not be effectively removed using this
process.
