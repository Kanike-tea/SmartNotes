two tuples shown in Figure 5.3 are identical. This makes sense at an abstract level,
since there really is no reason to prefer having one attribute value appear before
another in a tuple. When the attribute name and value are included together in a
tuple, it is known as self-describing data, because the description of each value
(attribute name) is included in the tuple.

We will mostly use the first definition of relation, where the attributes are ordered
in the relation schema and the values within tuples are similarly ordered, because it
simplifies much of the notation. However, the alternative definition given here is
more general.>

Values and NULLs in the Tuples. Each value in a tuple is an atomic value; that
is, it is not divisible into components within the framework of the basic relational
model. Hence, composite and multivalued attributes (see Chapter 3) are not
allowed. This model is sometimes called the flat relational model. Much of the
theory behind the relational model was developed with this assumption in mind,
which is called the first normal form assumption.® Hence, multivalued attributes
must be represented by separate relations, and composite attributes are represented
only by their simple component attributes in the basic relational model.”

An important concept is that of NULL values, which are used to represent the values of
attributes that may be unknown or may not apply to a tuple. A special value, called
NULL, is used in these cases. For example, in Figure 5.1, some STUDENT tuples have
NULL for their office phones because they do not have an office (that is, office phone
does not apply to these students). Another student has a NULL for home phone, presum-
ably because either he does not have a home phone or he has one but we do not know it
(value is unknown). In general, we can have several meanings for NULL values, such as
value unknown, value exists but is not available, or attribute does not apply to this tuple
(also known as value undefined). An example of the last type of NULL will occur if we
add an attribute Visa_status to the STUDENT relation that applies only to tuples repre-
senting foreign students. It is possible to devise different codes for different meanings of

5We will use the alternative definition of relation when we discuss query processing and optimization in
Chapter 18.

®We discuss this assumption in more detail in Chapter 14.

Extensions of the relational model remove these restrictions. For example, object-relational systems
(Chapter 12) allow complex-structured attributes, as do the non-first normal form or nested relational
models.
