Author_affil refers to the affiliation of author. Suppose the following depen-
dencies exist:

Book title > Publisher, Book_type
Book_type — List_price
Author_name — Author_affil
a. What normal form is the relation in? Explain your answer.

b. Apply normalization until you cannot decompose the relations further.
State the reasons behind each decomposition.

This exercise asks you to convert business statements into dependencies.
Consider the relation DISK_DRIVE (Serial_number, Manufacturer, Model, Batch,
Capacity, Retailer). Each tuple in the relation DISK_DRIVE contains information
about a disk drive with a unique Serial_number, made by a manufacturer, with a
particular model number, released in a certain batch, which has a certain stor-
age capacity and is sold by a certain retailer. For example, the tuple Disk_drive
((1978619’, ‘WesternDigital’, ‘A2235X’, ‘765234’, 500, ‘CompUSA’) specifies
that WesternDigital made a disk drive with serial number 1978619 and model
number A2235X, released in batch 765234; it is 5|00GB and sold by CompUSA.

Write each of the following dependencies as an FD:

a. The manufacturer and serial number uniquely identifies the drive.

b. A model number is registered by a manufacturer and therefore can’t be
used by another manufacturer.

c. All disk drives in a particular batch are the same model.

d. All disk drives of a certain model of a particular manufacturer have
exactly the same capacity.

Consider the following relation:
R (Doctor#, Patient#, Date, Diagnosis, Treat_code, Charge)

In the above relation, a tuple describes a visit of a patient to a doctor along
with a treatment code and daily charge. Assume that diagnosis is determined
(uniquely) for each patient by a doctor. Assume that each treatment code
has a fixed charge (regardless of patient). Is this relation in 2NF? Justify your
answer and decompose if necessary. Then argue whether further normaliza-
tion to 3NF is necessary, and if so, perform it.

Consider the following relation:

CAR_SALE (Car_id, Option_type, Option _listprice, Sale_date,
Option_discountedprice)

This relation refers to options installed in cars (e.g., cruise control) that were
sold at a dealership, and the list and discounted prices of the options.

If CarlD > Sale_date and Option_type > Option_listprice and CarlD, Option_type
> Option_discountedprice, argue using the generalized definition of the 3NF
