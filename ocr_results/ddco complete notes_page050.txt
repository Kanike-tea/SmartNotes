* Multiplexer circuits can be combined with common selection inputs to provide
multiple-bit selection logic. As an illustration, a quadruple 2-to-1-line multiplexer
is shown in Fig. 4.26 . The circuit has four multiplexers, each capable of selecting
one of two input lines. Output YO can be selected to come from either input AO or
input BO. Similarly, output Y1 may have the value of Al or B1, and so on. Input
selection line S selects one of the lines in each of the four multiplexers. The enable
input E must be active (i.e., asserted) for normal operation.

* As shown in the function table, the unit is enabled when E = 0. Then, if S = 0, the
four A inputs have a path to the four outputs. If, by contrast, S = 1, the four B inputs
are applied to the outputs. The outputs have all 0’s when E = 1, regardless of the
value of S .
