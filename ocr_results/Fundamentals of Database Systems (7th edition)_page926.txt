Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems

set of operations that can be used by the application programmers. The key is a
unique identifier associated with a data item and is used to locate this data item
rapidly. The value is the data item itself, and it can have very different formats for
different key-value storage systems. In some cases, the value is just a string of bytes
or an array of bytes, and the application using the key-value store has to interpret
the structure of the data value. In other cases, some standard formatted data is
allowed; for example, structured data rows (tuples) similar to relational data, or
semistructured data using JSON or some other self-describing data format. Differ-
ent key-value stores can thus store unstructured, semistructured, or structured data
items (see Section 13.1). The main characteristic of key-value stores is the fact that
every value (data item) must be associated with a unique key, and that retrieving the
value by supplying the key must be very fast.

There are many systems that fall under the key-value store label, so rather than pro-
vide a lot of details on one particular system, we will give a brief introductory over-
view for some of these systems and their characteristics.

24.4.1 DynamoDB Overview

The DynamoDB system is an Amazon product and is available as part of Amazon’s
AWS/SDK platforms (Amazon Web Services/Software Development Kit). It can be
used as part of Amazon’s cloud computing services, for the data storage component.

DynamoDB data model. The basic data model in DynamoDB uses the concepts
of tables, items, and attributes. A table in DynamoDB does not have a schema; it
holds a collection of self-describing items. Each item will consist of a number of
(attribute, value) pairs, and attribute values can be single-valued or multivalued. So
basically, a table will hold a collection of items, and each item is a self-describing
record (or object). DynamoDB also allows the user to specify the items in JSON for-
mat, and the system will convert them to the internal storage format of DynamoDB.

When a table is created, it is required to specify a table name and a primary key;
the primary key will be used to rapidly locate the items in the table. Thus, the pri-
mary key is the key and the item is the value for the DynamoDB key-value store.
The primary key attribute must exist in every item in the table. The primary key can
be one of the following two types:

= A single attribute. The DynamoDB system will use this attribute to build a
hash index on the items in the table. This is called a hash type primary key.
The items are not ordered in storage on the value of the hash attribute.

= A pair of attributes. This is called a hash and range type primary key. The
primary key will be a pair of attributes (A, B): attribute A will be used for hash-
ing, and because there will be multiple items with the same value of A, the B
values will be used for ordering the records with the same A value. A table
with this type of key can have additional secondary indexes defined on its
attributes. For example, if we want to store multiple versions of some type of
items in a table, we could use ItemID as hash and Date or Timestamp (when
the version was created) as range in a hash and range type primary key.
