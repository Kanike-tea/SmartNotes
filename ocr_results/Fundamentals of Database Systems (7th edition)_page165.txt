4.8 Summary

In this chapter we discussed extensions to the ER model that improve its repre-
sentational capabilities. We called the resulting model the enhanced ER or EER
model. We presented the concept of a subclass and its superclass and the related
mechanism of attribute/relationship inheritance. We saw how it is sometimes
necessary to create additional classes of entities, either because of additional spe-
cific attributes or because of specific relationship types. We discussed two main
processes for defining superclass/subclass hierarchies and lattices: specialization
and generalization.

Next, we showed how to display these new constructs in an EER diagram. We also
discussed the various types of constraints that may apply to specialization or gener-
alization. The two main constraints are total/partial and disjoint/overlapping. We
discussed the concept of a category or union type, which is a subset of the union of
two or more classes, and we gave formal definitions of all the concepts presented.

We introduced some of the notation and terminology of UML for representing
specialization and generalization. In Section 4.7, we briefly discussed the discipline
of knowledge representation and how it is related to semantic data modeling. We
also gave an overview and summary of the types of abstract data representation
concepts: classification and instantiation, identification, specialization and gener-
alization, and aggregation and association. We saw how EER and UML concepts
are related to each of these.

Review Questions
4.1. What is a subclass? When is a subclass needed in data modeling?

4.2. Define the following terms: superclass of a subclass, superclass/subclass rela-
tionship, IS-A relationship, specialization, generalization, category, specific
(local) attributes, and specific relationships.

4.3. Discuss the mechanism of attribute/relationship inheritance. Why is it use-
ful?

4.4. Discuss user-defined and predicate-defined subclasses, and identify the dif-
ferences between the two.

4.5. Discuss user-defined and attribute-defined specializations, and identify the
differences between the two.

4.6. Discuss the two main types of constraints on specializations and generalizations.

4.7. What is the difference between a specialization hierarchy and a specializa-
tion lattice?

4.8. What is the difference between specialization and generalization? Why do
we not display this difference in schema diagrams?
