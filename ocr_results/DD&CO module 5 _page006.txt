PERFORMING AN ARITHMETIC OR LOGIC OPERATION
¢ The ALU performs arithmetic operations on the 2 operands applied to its A and B
inputs.
¢ One of the operands is output of MUX;
And, the other operand is obtained directly from processor-bus.
¢ The result (produced by the ALU) is stored temporarily in register Z.
¢ The sequence of operations for [R3] (/R1]+[R2] is as follows:

1) Rlout, Yin

2) R2out, SelectY, Add, Zin

3) Zout, R3in

« Instruction execution proceeds as follows:
Step 1 --> Contents from register R1 are loaded into register Y.
p2 --> Contents from Y and from register R2 are applied to the A,and B inputs of ALU;

Addition is performed &
Result is stored in the Z register.
Step 3 --> The contents of Z register is stored in the R3 register.
¢ The signals are activated for the duration of the clock cycle corresponding to that
step. All other signals are inactive.

CONTROL-SIGNALS OF MDR
¢ The MDR register has 4 control-signals (Figure 7.4):
1) MDRin & MDRout contro! the connection to the internal processor data bus &
2) MDRinE & MDRoutE control the connection to the memory Data bus.
¢ MAR register has 2 control-signals.
1) MARin controls the connection to the internal processor address bus &
2) MARout controls the connection to the memory address bus.
