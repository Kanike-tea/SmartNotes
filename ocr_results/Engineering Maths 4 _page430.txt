STOCHASTIC PROCESS 421

Definitions

Probability Vector : By a vector we simply mean n tuple of numbers
“(D1 Vy, +10) where the quantities v,, U2, ...U, are called components of the

vector. s fa ‘i

rf vector vs ( %,, Dye +00 9,) is called, ‘a’ probability vector if each one of its
" components are non negative and their sum is equal to unity.

Examples : u =.(1,0):; 0 = = (12, 122) , w= (14, 1/4, V2) are all
probability vectors. F

Note: Ifv is not a probability v vector but ~ one of thev, (i = 1 to rt) are non negative

then Xho es proty vector where: = 1/ , 2,
i=1

For example # v= = ity 2; 3), then Me = 14 and (1/6, 2/6, 3/6) is a probability
vector. .

Stochastic Mattix : A square moi P= (Pig) having every row in the form of a
probability vector is called a stochastic matrix.

’ Examples +: (i), Identity matrix (D of any order.

Regular Stochaste Matrix: : A stochastic: matrix P is said to be a regular stochastic
matrix if.all the entries of some power P " are positive,
