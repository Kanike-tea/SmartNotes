This process of transmitting information from one neuron to another is known as synaptic
transmission and forms the basis of communication within the brain. Different types of
neurotransmitters have different effects on postsynaptic neurons, and the balance of
neurotransmitter levels can influence brain function, including mood, learning, and memory.
Signal transmission in the brain is also influenced by various forms of synaptic plasticity, including
long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which can modify the strength of
synaptic connections and contribute to learning and memory processes.

EEG

EEG stands for electroencephalography, which is a non-invasive method for measuring the
electrical activity of the brain. An EEG records the electrical signals generated by the brain's
neurons as they communicate with each other. The signals are recorded through electrodes placed
on the scalp and the resulting EEG pattern provides information about the synchronized electrical

activity of large populations of neurons.

Applications of EEG
Some of the most common applications of EEG are:

Diagnosis of Epilepsy: EEG is a widely used tool to diagnose epilepsy and other
seizure disorders. It can detect abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can
help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the location of the seizure focus.
Sleep Studies: EEG is often used in sleep studies to evaluate sleep patterns an
diagnose sleep disorders.

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): EEG can be used to control external devices such
as prosthetic limbs or computer software. This is done by detecting specific brain
waves associated with a particular mental state, such as concentration or relaxation.
Research on Brain Function: EEG is used in research to study brain function during
various activities such as reading, problem-solving, and decision-making. EEG can
also be used to investigate how the brain responds to stimuli such as light, sound,
and touch.

Diagnosis of Brain Disorders: EEG can be used to diagnose a wide range of brain
disorders including dementia, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury.
