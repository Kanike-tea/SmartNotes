of the inputs, but also of the present state of the storage elements. The next state of the storage elements
is also a function of external inputs and the present state. Thus, a sequential circuit is specified by a
time sequence of inputs, outputs, and internal states.

Block diagram of sequential circuit

There are two main types of sequential circuits, and their classification is a function of the timing of
their signals. A synchronous sequential circuit is a system whose behavior can be defined from the
knowledge of its signals at discrete instants of time. The behavior of an asynchronous sequential circuit
depends upon the input signals at any instant of time and the order in which the inputs change. The
storage elements commonly used in asynchronous sequential circuits are time-delay devices. The storage
capability of a time-delay device varies with the time it takes for the signal to propagate through the
device.

A synchronous sequential circuit employs signals that affect the storage elements at only discrete instants
of time. Synchronization is achieved by a timing device called a clock generator, which provides a
clock signal having the form of a periodic train of clock pulses. The clock signal is commonly denoted
by the identifiers clock and clk. The clock pulses are distributed throughout the system in such a way
that storage elements are affected only with the arrival of each pulse. Synchronous sequential circuits
that use clock pulses to control storage elements are called clocked sequential circuits and are the type
most frequently encountered in practice. They are called synchronous circuits because the activity within
the circuit and the resulting updating of stored values is synchronized to the occurrence of clock pulses.

The storage elements (memory) used in clocked sequential circuits are called flip-flops. A flip-flop is a
binary storage device capable of storing one bit of information. In a stable state, the output of a flip-flop
is either 0 or 1. A sequential circuit may use many flip-flops to store as many bits as necessary. The
block diagram of a synchronous clocked sequential circuit is shown in Fig(a) below. The outputs are
formed by a combinational logic function of the inputs to the circuit or the values stored in the flip-flops
(or both). The value that is stored in a flip-flop when the clock pulse occurs is also determined by the
inputs to the circuit or the values presently stored in the flip-flop (or both). If the clock (synchronizing)
pulses arrive at a regular interval, as shown in the timing diagram in Fig(b), the combinational logic
must respond to a change in the state of the flip-flop in time to be updated before the next pulse arrives.
