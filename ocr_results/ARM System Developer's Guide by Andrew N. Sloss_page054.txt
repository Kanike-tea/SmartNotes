* E extension provides enhanced multiply instructions and saturation.

One significant variation in the ARM7 family is the ARM7TDMI-S. The ARM7TDMI-S

has the same operating characteristics as a standard ARM7TDMI but is also synthesizable.

ARM720T is the most flexible member of the ARM7 family because it includes an

MMU. The presence of the MMU means the ARM720T is capable of handling the Linux
and Microsoft embedded platform operating systems. The processor also includes a unified
8K cache. The vector table can be relocated to a higher address by setting a coprocessor
15 register.

Another variation is the ARM7EJ-S processor, also synthesizable. ARM7EJ-S is quite

different since it includes a five-stage pipeline and executes ARMvSTEJ instructions. This
version of the ARM7 is the only one that provides both Java acceleration and the enhanced
instructions but without any memory protection.
