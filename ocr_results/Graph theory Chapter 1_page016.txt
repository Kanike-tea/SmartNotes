> The first of the graphs is nor complete. It is not simple on the one hand and there is no edge
between A and C on the other hand. The second of the graphs is complete. It is a simple graph
and there is an edge between every pair of vertices. a

> Each edge of a graph is determined by a pair of vertices. In a simple graph there occur no
multiple edges. As such, in.a simple graph, the number of edges cannot exceed the number of
pairs of vertices. The number of pairs of vertices that can be choosen from n vertices is (from
the theory of combinations)*

Thus, for a simple graph with n (> 2) vertices, the number of edges cannot exceed $n(n— 1).
Accordingly, if a simple graph G = G(V, E) has n vertices and m edges, then m < $n(n— 1), or,
2m < n? —n; that is : 2|E] = |VF - IVI. a
Remark: If a graph is not simple, it can have any number of edges (because, in such a graph
multiple edges and loops are allowed).

Show that a complete graph with n vertices, namely K,, has in(n — 1) edges.

> In acomplete graph, there exists exactly one edge between every pair of vestioes: As such,
the number of edges in a complete graph is equal to the number of pairs of vertices. If the
Number of vertices is n, then the number of pairs of vertices is
