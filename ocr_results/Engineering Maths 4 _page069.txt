Since LHS is a function of 7,6 and RHS is a function of 4, they must be equal toa . -

Again LHS is a function of 8 and RHSisa ‘function of 1, with the result they must be
equal to a constant. ; ;

Now by taking x = cos @, we shall convert the differential equation given by (4)
in terms of f, and xas follows.
