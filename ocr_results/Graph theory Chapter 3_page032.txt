We observe that in the first of the coding schemes considered above, the code | is assigned
toa, the code 10 is assigned to n and the code 101 is assigned to ¢ and that the code assigned
to rcontains the codes assigned to @ and n as prefixes, This is why there arises ambiguity in
decoding. In the second of the coding schemes, the code of any letter is not a prefix of the code
of any other eter. This is why there cannot be ambiguity in wecoding. Coding schemes of this
type are of interest in coding theory and a brief account of thé same is given in the following

paragraphs.

Prefix Codes

Let P be a set of binary sequences that Tepresent a set of symbols. Then P is called a prefix
_ code’ if no sequence in P is the prefix of any other sequence in P.
For example, the sets

P; = {10,0,1101,111,1100}, and P = (000,001, 01, 10, 11)
are prefix codes, whereas the sets
Ay = {01,0,101, 10,1} and Ap = {1,00, 01, 000, 0001)

_4e not prefix codes. Jt p

Prefix codes can be represented by binary trees as illustrated below.
Consider the prefix code f ‘y
a P = (000, 001,01, 10, 11}

indicated above. In this code? the longest sequence has length 3. Keeping this in mind, let us —
tuct a full binary tree of height 3, and assign the symbol 0 to every edge that is directed
ds the child in the left from its parent vertex and 1 to every edge that is directed towards
Child in the right, as shown in Figure 3.39°.
fle five sequences present in P2.can now be identified .with five vertices of the above
~ We note that the vertex marked.A can be reached from the root r through he wee edges
10,0, 0. Accordingly, the vertex A can be assigned the sequence 000. Similarly, the
_“Xtmarked B can be assigned the sequence 001, the vertex marked C can be assigned the
ence 01, the vertex marked D can be assigned the sequence 10, and the vertex marked E
Pe assigned the sequence 11. ‘Thus, all the five sequences present in P2 can be assigned to
Vertices, marked A, B, C, D, E, of the tree being considered.
