implementation to define. Note that Al , A2, and so forth may be individuals, like
John in IT department or Mary in marketing; but they may also be applications or
programs that want to access a database.

In SQL2, the same effect can be accomplished by having the DBA issue a CREATE
SCHEMA command, as follows:

CREATE SCHEMA EXAMPLE AUTHORIZATION A1;

User account A1 can now create tables under the schema called EXAMPLE. To con-
tinue our example, suppose that A1 creates the two base relations EMPLOYEE and
DEPARTMENT shown in Figure 30.1; A is then the owner of these two relations and
hence has all the relation privileges on each of them.

Next, suppose that account A1 wants to grant to account A2 the privilege to insert and
delete tuples in both of these relations. However, A1 does not want A2 to be able to
propagate these privileges to additional accounts. A1 can issue the following command:

GRANT INSERT, DELETE ON EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT TO A2;

Notice that the owner account A1 of a relation automatically has the GRANT OPTION,
allowing it to grant privileges on the relation to other accounts. However, account A2
cannot grant INSERT and DELETE privileges on the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT
tables because A2 was not given the GRANT OPTION in the preceding command.

Next, suppose that A1 wants to allow account A3 to retrieve information from either
of the two tables and also to be able to propagate the SELECT privilege to other
accounts. A1 can issue the following command:

GRANT SELECT ON EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT TO A3 WITH GRANT OPTION;

The clause WITH GRANT OPTION means that A3 can now propagate the privilege to
other accounts by using GRANT. For example, A3 can grant the SELECT privilege on
the EMPLOYEE relation to A4 by issuing the following command:

GRANT SELECT ON EMPLOYEE TO A4;

Notice that A4 cannot propagate the SELECT privilege to other accounts because
the GRANT OPTION was not given to A4.

Now suppose that A1 decides to revoke the SELECT privilege on the EMPLOYEE
relation from A3; A1 then can issue this command:

REVOKE SELECT ON EMPLOYEE FROM A3;
