24.1 Introduction to NOSQL Systems

will discuss some of the hashing, partitioning, and indexing techniques in
Sections 24.3 through 24.6 when we discuss specific systems.

NOSQL characteristics related to data models and query languages.
NOSQL systems emphasize performance and flexibility over modeling power and
complex querying. We discuss some of these characteristics next.

1. Not Requiring a Schema: The flexibility of not requiring a schema is
achieved in many NOSQL systems by allowing semi-structured, self-
describing data (see Section 13.1). The users can specify a partial schema in
some systems to improve storage efficiency, but it is not required to have a
schema in most of the NOSQL systems. As there may not be a schema to
specify constraints, any constraints on the data would have to be pro-
grammed in the application programs that access the data items. There are
various languages for describing semistructured data, such as JSON (JavaScript
Object Notation) and XML (Extensible Markup Language; see Chapter 13).
JSON is used in several NOSQL systems, but other methods for describing
semi-structured data can also be used. We will discuss JSON in Section 24.3
when we present document-based NOSQL systems.

2. Less Powerful Query Languages: Many applications that use NOSQL sys-
tems may not require a powerful query language such as SQL, because
search (read) queries in these systems often locate single objects in a single
file based on their object keys. NOSQL systems typically provide a set of
functions and operations as a programming API (application programming
interface), so reading and writing the data objects is accomplished by calling
the appropriate operations by the programmer. In many cases, the opera-
tions are called CRUD operations, for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. In
other cases, they are known as SCRUD because of an added Search (or Find)
operation. Some NOSQL systems also provide a high-level query language,
but it may not have the full power of SQL; only a subset of SQL querying
capabilities would be provided. In particular, many NOSQL systems do not
provide join operations as part of the query language itself; the joins need to
be implemented in the application programs.

3. Versioning: Some NOSQL systems provide storage of multiple versions of
the data items, with the timestamps of when the data version was created.
We will discuss this aspect in Section 24.5 when we present column-based
NOSQL systems.

In the next section, we give an overview of the various categories of NOSQL
systems.

24.1.3 Categories of NOSQL Systems

NOSQL systems have been characterized into four major categories, with some
additional categories that encompass other types of systems. The most common
categorization lists the following four major categories:
