then complemented. The right side of the expression is xy, so the complement of x and the complement

of y are both evaluated first and the result is then ANDed.
Boolean Functions

Boolean algebra is an algebra that deals with binary variables and logic operations. A Boolean function
described by an algebraic expression consists of binary variables, the constants 0 and 1, and the logic

operation symbols. For a given value of the binary variables, the function can be equal to either 1 or 0.

As an example, consider the Boolean function

Fi =Sxt+y’'z
The function F1 is equal to 1 if x is equal to | or if both y and z are equal to 1. F1 is equal to 0 otherwise.
The complement operation dictates that when y = 1, y = 0. Therefore, Fl = 1 ifx = 1 or ify =0 and z=

1. A Boolean function expresses the logical relationship between binary variables and is evaluated by

determining the binary value of the expression for all possible values of the variables.

A Boolean function can be represented in a truth table. The number of rows in the truth table is 2n ,
where n is the number of variables in the function. The binary combinations for the truth table are

obtained from the binary numbers by counting from 0 through 2n - 1.
