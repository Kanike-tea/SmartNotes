Space and Time Trade-Offs

information about values to be sorted. Indeed, we can scan the list to compute
the number of 1’s and the number of 2’s in it and then, on the second pass,
simply make the appropriate number of the first elements equal to 1 and the
remaining elements equal to 2. More generally, if element values are integers
between some lower bound / and upper bound wu, we can compute the frequency
of each of those values and store them in array F[0..u —/]. Then the first F[0]
positions in the sorted list must be filled with /, the next F[1] positions with / + 1,
and so on. All this can be done, of course, only if we can overwrite the given
elements.

Let us consider a more realistic situation of sorting a list of items with some
other information associated with their keys so that we cannot overwrite the list’s
elements. Then we can copy elements into a new array S[0..n — 1]to hold the sorted
list as follows. The elements of A whose values are equal to the lowest possible
value / are copied into the first F[0] elements of S, i.e., positions 0 through F[0] — 1;
the elements of value / + 1 are copied to positions from F[0] to (F[0]+ F[1]) — 1;
and so on. Since such accumulated sums of frequencies are called a distribution
in statistics, the method itself is known as distribution counting.

EXAMPLE Consider sorting the array

13 | 11 | 12.) 13} 12 | 12

whose values are known to come from the set {11, 12, 13} and should not be
overwritten in the process of sorting. The frequency and distribution arrays are
as follows:

Array values M1213
Frequencies 1 3 2
Distribution values. 14

Note that the distribution values indicate the proper positions for the last occur-
rences of their elements in the final sorted array. If we index array positions from 0
ton — 1, the distribution values must be reduced by 1 to get corresponding element
positions.

It is more convenient to process the input array right to left. For the example,
the last element is 12, and, since its distribution value is 4, we place this 12 in
position 4 — 1 =3 of the array S that will hold the sorted list. Then we decrease
the 12’s distribution value by 1 and proceed to the next (from the right) element
in the given array. The entire processing of this example is depicted in Figure 7.2.
