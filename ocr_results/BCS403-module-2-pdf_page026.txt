Database Management System [BCS403]

In general, if R has nr tuples and S has ns tuples, the result of a JOIN operation R 4. <join condition S
will have between zero and np * ns tuples. The expected size of the join result divided by the

*ns_ leads to a ratio called join selectivity, which is a property of each join

maximum size nr
condition. If there is no join condition, all combinations of tuples qualify and the JOIN degenerates

into a CARTESIAN PRODUCT, also called CROSS PRODUCT or CROSS JOIN.

A single JOIN operation is used to combine data from two relations so that related information can
be presented in a single table. These operations are also known as inner joins. Informally, an inner
join is a type of match and combine operation defined formally as a combination of CARTESIAN
PRODUCT and SELECTION.The NATURAL JOIN or EQUIJOIN operation. can also be specified.
among multiple tables, leading to an n-way join. For example, consider the following three-way join:

((PROJECT 4 psm-DrumberEPARTMENT) >< sen&MPLOYEE)

Mgr_ssr:

This combines each project tuple with its controlling department tuple into a single tuple, and then
combines that tuple with an employee tuple that is the department. manager. The net result is a
consolidated relation in which each tuple contains this project-department-manager combined
information.
In SQL, JOIN can be realized in several different ways

- The first method is to specify the <join conditions> in the WHERE clause, along with any

other selection conditions.
- The second way is to use a nested relation

- Another way is to use the concept of joined tables
2.4.3, A Complete Set of Relational Algebra Operations

The set of relational algebra operations {o, 1, U, p,—, x} is a complete set; that is, any of the other
original relational algebra operations can be expressed as a sequence of operations from this set.
For example, the INTERSECTION operation can be expressed by using UNION and MINUS as

follows:
RNS=(RUS)—((R-S) U(S-R))

As another example, a JOIN operation can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT followed by a
SELECT operation,

Rts <condition: 5 = 6 condition (R x S)
