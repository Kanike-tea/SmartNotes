EMPLOYEE E refers to DEPARTMENT D, then the value of Has_emps for DEPARTMENT
D must include a reference to E in its set of EMPLOYEE references. If the database
designer desires to have a relationship to be represented in only one direction, then
it has to be modeled as an attribute (or operation). An example is the Manager com-
ponent of the Mgr attribute in DEPARTMENT.

In addition to attributes and relationships, the designer can include operations in
object type (class) specifications. Each object type can have a number of operation
signatures, which specify the operation name, its argument types, and its returned
value, if applicable. Operation names are unique within each object type, but they
can be overloaded by having the same operation name appear in distinct object
types. The operation signature can also specify the names of exceptions that
can occur during operation execution. The implementation of the operation
will include the code to raise these exceptions. In Figure 12.7 the EMPLOYEE class
