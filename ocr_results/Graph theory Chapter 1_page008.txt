4.2 Graphs

IF consider again the diagram in Figure 1.1. Let us redraw this diagram by dropping the arrows
present in the edges. The rewritten diagram appears as shown below.

We say that this (rewritten) diagram represents the diagram of an underlying graph of the
directed graph shown in Figure 1.1. This underlying graph has the same vertices and the same
edges as the original directed graph; but its edges are all undirected._}

We observe that Figure 1.13 depicts a diagram of the underlying graph of the directed graph
shown in Figure 1.2 as well.

The underlying graph of a directed graph is an example of what is called an undirected
_ graph. Like a directed graph, an undirected graph also consists of a nonempty set of vertices
and a set of edges, but the edges are all “undirected”. An edge in a undirected graph is deter-
mined and represented by an unordered pair of vertices. For example, in the undirected graph
shown in Figure 1.13, the edge AB is determined by the vertices A and B and is represented by
| the unordered pair {A, B} = {B, A}.* For brevity in terminology, an undirected graph is referred
to as just a graph (— the adjective “undirected” being understood).*
The formal definition of a graph is given below.

_ Definition of a Graph
(a graph is a pair (V,E), where V is a nonempty set and E is a set of unordered pairs of
elements taken from the set V.
For a graph (V, E), the elements of V are called vertices (or points or nodes) and the ele-
ments of E are called undirected edges or just edges. The set V is called the vertex set and the

Set E is called the edge set. si
The graph (V, E) is also denoted by G = (V, E) or G = G(V, E) or just G when poe ase

*We use the notation (A, B) to denote the ordered pair of A and B in that order and the notation (4, B}

for the unordered pai
pair of A and B.
