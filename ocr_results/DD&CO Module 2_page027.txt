in the set state. After both inputs go back to 1, we are allowed to change the state of the latch by placing
a 0 in the R input. This action causes the circuit to go to the reset state and stay there even after both
inputs return to 1. The condition that is forbidden for the NAND latch is both inputs being equal to 0 at
the same time, an input combination that should be avoided.

SR latch with NAND gates

In comparing the NAND with the NOR latch, note that the input signals for the NAND require the
complement of those values used for the NOR latch. Because the NAND latch requires a 0 signal to
change its state, it is sometimes referred to as an S'R' latch.

The operation of the basic SR latch can be modified by providing an additional input signal that
determines (controls) when the state of the latch can be changed by determining whether S and R (or S'
and R’) can affect the circuit. An SR latch with a control input is shown in below Fig. It consists of the
basic SR latch and two additional NAND gates. The control input En acts as an enable signal for the
other two inputs. The outputs of the NAND gates stay at the logic-1 level as long as the enable signal
remains at 0. This is the quiescent condition for the SR latch. When the enable input goes to 1,
information from the S or R input is allowed to affect the latch. The set state is reached with S = 1, R=
0, and En = 1 (active-high enabled).

SR latch with control input

To change to the reset state, the inputs must be S = 0, R = 1, and En = 1. In either case, when En returns
to 0, the circuit remains in its current state. The control input disables the circuit by applying 0 to En, so
that the state of the output does not change regardless of the values of S and R. Moreover, when En = |
and both the S and R inputs are equal to 0, the state of the circuit does not change. These conditions are
listed in the function table accompanying the diagram.

D Latch (Transparent Latch)

One way to eliminate the undesirable condition of the indeterminate state in the SR latch is to ensure
that inputs S and R are never equal to 1 at the same time. This is done in the D latch, shown in below
Fig. This latch has only two inputs: D (data) and En (enable).
