35. A certain stimulus administered to each ofthe 12 patients resulted in the following change.
in blood pressure, 5,2, 8, -1,3, 0, 6, -2, 1, 5, 0,4. Can it be concluded

that the stimulus:tuill increase the blood pressure? (tg for i1 d-f = 2,201)

Let us suppose that the stimulus administration is not accompanied with inctease in:
blood pressure, we can take } = 0 : a ‘

2.5833 - 0
2a = 24 = 2! 201
i="Sa Vi2 = 2.8979 =~ 29 > 2.2
Hence the hypothesis is rejected at 5% level of significance. We conclude with
95% confidence that the stimulus in general is accompanied with increase in
blood pressure. - . ot e
