7. Result extracts revealed that in a certain school over a peried & fibe years 725 students

had passed and 615 students Jad failed. Test the iiladaml that, success and failure are
in equal proportions. .

>> Total number of students = 725+615 = 1340

725
Observed proportion of success = 7340 = 0.54
Suppose that success and failure are in equal proportion. Then p = 1/2

*. difference in proportion= 0.54-0.5 = 0.04

S.D proportion of success = wTPA | = = [ee = 0.014
n

x= 0.04
o ~ 0014 :
Thus the hypothesis that success and failure are in equal proportion is rejected.

Aliter : Observed number of successes = 725

In terms of proportion Z = = 2.86 > 2.58

Expected number of successes = 1340/2 = 670

= = So = 3.005 > 2.58
~ Vip V1340 x 1/2 x 1/2
Hence the ipa is rejected.

8. A sample of 900 days was taken in a coastal town and it was found that on 100 days the
weather was very hot. Obtain the probable limits of the percentage of very hot weather.

>> Probability of very hot weather = p = 9079 "959
Probable limits = p+2.58 Vpq/n
: 1.8 1
= 0.1114(2.58) 9 x 9 x 900 = 0.111 + 0.027
= 0.084 and 0.138

Probable limits of very hot weather is 8.4% to 13.8%

9. Inasample of. 500 men it was found that 60% of them had over weight. What can we ;

about the proportion of people having over weight in the population ? ?

ig 0.6 ‘&.q =.1-p=04

>> Probability of persons having over weight= p = 100

Probable limits = p + 2.58 \pq/n
