large graph as a combination of small ones and to derive its properties from
those of the small ones. Since graphs are defined in terms of the sets of vertices
and edges, it is natural to employ the set-theoretical terminology to define
operations between graphs. In particular:

The union of two graphs G, = (Vj, E,) and Gy = (V», E>) is another graph G3
(written as G3 = G, LU G2) whose vertex set V3 = V, LU V> and the edge set E3 =
E, U Ep. Likewise, the intersection G, () Gz of graphs G, and G, is a graph Gy
consisting only of those vertices and edges that are in both G, and G». The ring
sum of two graphs G, and G, (written as G; ® G,) is a graph consisting of the
vertex set V, LU V, and of edges that are either in G, or G,, but not in both. Two
graphs and their union, intersection, and ring sum are shown in Fig. 2-14.

It is obvious from their definitions that the three operations just mentioned are
commutative. That is,

G1UG2=G2UG1, 61 G2 = 621 G1,
G1 ® Gp = Go @ Gy.

If G, and Gy are edge disjoint, then G, () Gp is a null graph, and G; ® Gy =
G, U G). If G, and G, are vertex disjoint, then G, () G, is empty. For any graph
G,

GUG=G[\G=G,
and
G ® G=anull graph.

If g is a subgraph of G, then G © g is, by definition, that subgraph of G which
remains after all the edges in g have been removed from G. Therefore, G @ g is
written as G — g, whenever g C G. Because of this complementary nature, G ®
g = G~g is often called the complement of g in G.

Decomposition: A graph G is said to have been decomposed into two
subgraphs g, and gp if
