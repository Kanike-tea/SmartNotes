Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

to a user request in an IR query represents the IR system’s best attempt at retrieving
the information most relevant to that query. Whereas database systems maintain a
large amount of metadata and allow their use in query optimization, the operations
in IR systems rely on the data values themselves and their occurrence frequencies.
Complex statistical analysis is sometimes performed to determine the relevance of
each document or parts of a document to the user request.

27.1.3 A Brief History of IR

Information retrieval has been a common task since the times of ancient civiliza-
tions, which devised ways to organize, store, and catalog documents and records.
Media such as papyrus scrolls and stone tablets were used to record documented
information in ancient times. These efforts allowed knowledge to be retained and
transferred among generations. With the emergence of public libraries and the
printing press, large-scale methods for producing, collecting, archiving, and dis-
tributing documents and books evolved. As computers and automatic storage sys-
tems emerged, the need to apply these methods to computerized systems arose.
Several techniques emerged in the 1950s, such as the seminal work of H. P. Luhn,°
who proposed using words and their frequency counts as indexing units for docu-
ments, and using measures of word overlap between queries and documents as the
retrieval criterion. It was soon realized that storing large amounts of text was not
difficult. The harder task was to search for and retrieve that information selectively
for users with specific information needs. Methods that explored word distribution
statistics gave rise to the choice of keywords based on their distribution properties®
and also led to keyword-based weighting schemes.

The earlier experiments with document retrieval systems such as SMART” in the 1960s
adopted the inverted file organization based on keywords and their weights as the
method of indexing (see Section 17.6.4 on inverted indexing). Serial (or sequential)
organization proved inadequate if queries required fast, near real-time response times.
Proper organization of these files became an important area of study; document clas-
sification and clustering schemes ensued. The scale of retrieval experiments remained
a challenge due to lack of availability of large text collections. This soon changed with
the World Wide Web. Also, the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) was launched by
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in 1992 as a part of the
TIPSTER program* with the goal of providing a platform for evaluating information
retrieval methodologies and facilitating technology transfer to develop IR products.

A search engine is a practical application of information retrieval to large-scale docu-
ment collections. With significant advances in computers and communications tech-
nologies, people today have interactive access to enormous amounts of user-generated
