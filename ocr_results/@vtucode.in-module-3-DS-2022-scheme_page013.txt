3, Degree two tree (Binary Tree

To obtain the degree-two tree representation of a tree, simply rotate the right-sibling
pointers in a left child-right sibling tree clockwise by 45 degrees. This gives us the degree-
two tree displayed in Figure (E).

Figure (E): degree-two representation

In the degree-two representation, a node has two children as the left and right children.

Different kinds of Binary Tree
L.Skewed Tree
A skewed tree is a tree, skewed to the left or skews to the right.
or
It is a tree consisting of only left subtree or only right subtree.
e A tree with only left subtrees is called Left Skewed Binary Tree.
e A tree with only right subtrees is called Right Skewed Binary Tree.
