as proteins and blood cells, stay in the blood vessel. The tubule returns needed substances to
your blood and removes wastes.

A blood vessel runs alongside the tubule. As the filtered fluid moves along the tubule, the
blood vessel reabsorbs almost all of the water, along with minerals and nutrients your body
needs. The tubule helps remove excess acid from the blood. The remaining fluid and wastes
in the tubule become urine.

12. Explain Muscular and skeletal system in detail.
Answer:

Skeletal muscle architecture is one of the most important properties that determine a muscle’s
force and excursion capability. In the current review, basic architectural terms first are
reviewed, and then specific examples relevant to upper extremity anatomy are presented.
Specific examples of anatomic considerations required for surgical reconstruction after radial
nerve palsy also are detailed. Together, these data show not only the wide variety of
architectural designs in human muscles but the importance of considering architectural design
when making surgical decisions. The relationship between structure and function in skeletal
muscle has been described and probed for more than a century. A classic study has elucidated
the microscopic and ultrastructural properties of skeletal muscle fibers, yielding great insights
into their function. However, less attention has been given to excellent and insightful studies
of the macroscopic properties of skeletal muscle tissues dating back to the 1600s. This
macroscopic arrangement of muscle fibers is known as a muscle’s architecture.

The musculoskeletal system (locomotor system) is a human body system that provides our
body with movement, stability, shape, and support. It is subdivided into two broad systems:
Muscular system, which includes all types of muscles in the body, skeletal muscles, in
particular, is the ones that act on the body joints to produce movements. Besides muscles, the
muscular
