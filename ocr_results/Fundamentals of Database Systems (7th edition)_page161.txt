4.7 Data Abstraction, Knowledge Representation, and Ontology Concepts

object. For example, we may have a tuple <‘Matthew Clarke’, ‘610618’, ‘376-9821’> in
a PERSON relation and another tuple <“301-54-0836’, ‘CS’, 3.8> in a STUDENT rela-
tion that happen to represent the same real-world entity. There is no way to identify
the fact that these two database objects (tuples) represent the same real-world
entity unless we make a provision at design time for appropriate cross-referencing to
supply this identification. Hence, identification is needed at two levels:

= To distinguish among database objects and classes
= To identify database objects and to relate them to their real-world counterparts

In the EER model, identification of schema constructs is based on a system of
unique names for the constructs in a schema. For example, every class in an EER
schema—whether it is an entity type, a subclass, a category, or a relationship type—
must have a distinct name. The names of attributes of a particular class must also be
distinct. Rules for unambiguously identifying attribute name references in a spe-
cialization or generalization lattice or hierarchy are needed as well.

At the object level, the values of key attributes are used to distinguish among enti-
ties of a particular entity type. For weak entity types, entities are identified by a
combination of their own partial key values and the entities they are related to in
the owner entity type(s). Relationship instances are identified by some combination
of the entities that they relate to, depending on the cardinality ratio specified.

4.7.3 Specialization and Generalization

Specialization is the process of classifying a class of objects into more specialized
subclasses. Generalization is the inverse process of generalizing several classes into
a higher-level abstract class that includes the objects in all these classes. Specializa-
tion is conceptual refinement, whereas generalization is conceptual synthesis. Sub-
classes are used in the EER model to represent specialization and generalization.
We call the relationship between a subclass and its superclass an IS-A-SUBCLASS-OF
relationship, or simply an IS-A relationship. This is the same as the IS-A relation-
ship discussed earlier in Section 4.5.3.

4.7.4 Aggregation and Association

Aggregation is an abstraction concept for building composite objects from their
component objects. There are three cases where this concept can be related to the
EER model. The first case is the situation in which we aggregate attribute values of
an object to form the whole object. The second case is when we represent an aggre-
gation relationship as an ordinary relationship. The third case, which the EER
model does not provide for explicitly, involves the possibility of combining objects
that are related by a particular relationship instance into a higher-level aggregate
object. This is sometimes useful when the higher-level aggregate object is itself to be
related to another object. We call the relationship between the primitive objects and
their aggregate object IS-A-PART-OF; the inverse is called Is-A-COMPONENT-OF.
UML provides for all three types of aggregation.
