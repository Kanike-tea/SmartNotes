16.10 Parallelizing Disk Access Using
RAID Technology

With the exponential growth in the performance and capacity of semiconductor
devices and memories, faster microprocessors with larger and larger primary mem-
ories are continually becoming available. To match this growth, it is natural to
expect that secondary storage technology must also take steps to keep up with pro-

cessor technology in performance and reliability.

A major advance in secondary storage technology is represented by the develop-
ment of RAID, which originally stood for redundant arrays of inexpensive disks.
More recently, the J in RAID is said to stand for independent. The RAID idea
received a very positive industry endorsement and has been developed into an elab-
orate set of alternative RAID architectures (RAID levels 0 through 6). We highlight

the main features of the technology in this section.

The main goal of RAID is to even out the widely different rates of performance
improvement of disks against those in memory and microprocessors.” Although
RAM capacities have quadrupled every two to three years, disk access times are
improving at less than 10% per year, and disk transfer rates are improving at roughly
20% per year. Disk capacities are indeed improving at more than 50% per year, but
the speed and access time improvements are of a much smaller magnitude.

A second qualitative disparity exists between the ability of special microprocessors
that cater to new applications involving video, audio, image, and spatial data pro-
cessing (see Chapters 26 for details of these applications), with corresponding lack

of fast access to large, shared data sets.

The natural solution is a large array of small independent disks acting as a single
higher performance logical disk. A concept called data striping is used, which utilizes
parallelism to improve disk performance. Data striping distributes data transpar-
ently over multiple disks to make them appear as a single large, fast disk. Figure
16.13 shows a file distributed or striped over four disks. In bit-level striping, a byte is
split and individual bits are stored on independent disks. Figure 16.13(a) illustrates
bit-striping across four disks where the bits (0, 4) are assigned to disk 0, bits (1, 5) to
disk 1, and so on. With this striping, every disk participates in every read or write
operation; the number of accesses per second would remain the same as on a single
disk, but the amount of data read in a given time would increase fourfold. Thus,
striping improves overall I/O performance by providing high overall transfer rates.
Block-level striping stripes blocks across disks. It treats the array of disks as if it is
one disk. Blocks are logically numbered from 0 in sequence. Disks in an m-disk array
are numbered 0 to m - 1. With striping, block j goes to disk (j mod m). Figure
16.13(b) illustrates block striping with four disks (m = 4). Data striping also accom-
plishes load balancing among disks. Moreover, by storing redundant information on

'7This was predicted by Gordon Bell to be about 40% every year between 1974 and 1984 and is now

supposed to exceed 50% per year.
