Operands for the SIMD instructions are not always found in the correct order within the
source registers; to improve the efficiency of dealing with these situations, there are 16-bit
SIMD operations that perform swapping of the 16-bit words of one operand register. These
operations allow a great deal of flexibility in dealing with halfwords that may be aligned in
different ways in memory and are particularly useful when working with 16-bit complex
number pairs that are packed into 32-bit registers. There are signed, unsigned, saturating
signed, and saturating unsigned versions of these operations, as shown in Table 15.3.

The X in the instruction mnemonic signifies that the two halfwords in Rm are swapped
before the operations are applied so that operations like the following take place:

Rd[15:0] = Rn[15:0] - Rm[31:16]
Rd [31:16] = Rn[31:16] + Rm[15:0]

The addition of the SIMD operations means there is nowa need for some way of showing
an overflow or a carry from each SIMD slice through the datapath. The cpsr as originally
