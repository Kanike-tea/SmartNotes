LECTURE-7: Advanced ER-Diagram:

Abstraction is the simplification mechanism used to hide superfluous details of a set of objects. It
allows one to concentrate on the properties that are of interest to the application. There are two main
abstraction mechanism used to model information:

Generalization and specialization:

Generalization is the abstracting process of viewing set of objects as a single general class by
concentrating on the general characteristics of the constituent sets while suppressing or ignoring
their differences. It is the union of a number of lower-level entity types for the purpose of
producing a higher-level entity type. For instance, student is a generalization of graduate or
undergraduate, full-time or part-time students. Similarly, employee is generalization of the classes
of objects cook, waiter, and cashier. Generalization is an IS_A relationship; therefore, manager
IS_AN employee, cook IS_AN employee, waiter IS_AN employee, and so forth.

Specialization is the abstracting process of introducing new characteristics to an existing class of
objects to create one or more new classes of objects. This involves taking a higher-level, and using
additional characteristics, generating lower-level entities. The lower-level entities also inherits the,
characteristics of the higher-level entity. In applying the characteristics size to car we can create a
full-size, mid-size, compact or subcompact car. Specialization may be seen as the reverse process of
generalization addition specific properties are introduced at a lower level in a hierarchy of objects.
