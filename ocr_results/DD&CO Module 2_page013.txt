According to above Table, the higher the subscript number, the higher the priority of the input. Input D3
has the highest priority, so, regardless of the values of the other inputs, when this input is 1, the output
for xy is 11 (binary 3). D2 has the next priority level. The output is 10 if D2 = 1, provided that D3 = 0,
regardless of the values of the other two lower priority inputs. The output for D1 is generated only if
higher priority inputs are 0, and so on down the priority levels.

x=D,+D3 y=D;+D,D',

The maps for simplifying outputs x and y are shown above. Although the table has only five rows, when
each X in a row is replaced first by 0 and then by 1, we obtain all 16 possible input combinations. For
example, the fourth row in the table, with inputs XX10, represents the four minterms 0010, 0110, 1010,
and 1110. The simplified Boolean expressions for the priority encoder are obtained from the maps. The
condition for output V is an OR function of all the input variables

x=D,+D;
y= Ds + Di Ds
V = Do + D, + D2 + D3

Four-input priority encoder
Multiplexers

A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of many input lines
and directs it to a single output line. The selection of a particular input line is controlled by a set of
selection lines. Normally, there are 2" input lines and n selection lines whose bit combinations determine
which input is selected.

Two-to-One-line multiplexer

A two-to-one-line multiplexer connects one of two 1-bit sources to a common destination, as shown in
Fig below. The circuit has two data input lines, one output line, and one selection line S. When S = 0,
the upper AND gate is enabled and Ip has a path to the output. When S = 1, the lower AND gate is
