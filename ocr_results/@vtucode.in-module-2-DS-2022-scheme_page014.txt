DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 2

REPRESENTATION OF LINKED LISTS IN MEMORY
Let LIST be a linked list. Then LIST will be maintained in memory as follows.
1. LIST requires two linear arrays such as DATA and LINK-such that DATA[K] and
LINK[K] contains the information part and the nextpointer field of a node of LIST.
2. LIST also requires a variable name such as START which contains the location of
the beginning of the list, and a nextpointer sentinel denoted by NULL-which
indicates the end of the list.
3. The subscripts of the arrays DATA and LINK will be positive, so choose NULL =
0, unless otherwise stated.
The following examples of linked lists indicate that the nodes of a list need not occupy
adjacent elements in the arrays DATA and LINK, and that more than one list may be
maintained in the same linear arrays DATA and LINK. However, each list must have its

own pointer variable giving the location of its first node.
