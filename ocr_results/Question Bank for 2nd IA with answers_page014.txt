The super hydrophobic effect refers to the ability of certain surfaces to repel water and resist wetting.
Super hydrophobic surfaces are characterized by a high contact angle between water droplets and the
surface, typically over 150 degrees, and a low contact angle hysteresis, meaning that the droplets roll off

the surface with ease.

The super hydrophobic effect is achieved through the use of various techniques. These techniques create
a surface structure that traps air between the surface and the water droplets, reducing the contact area
between them and making it more difficult for the droplets to wet the surface.

Engineering Applications of Super Hydrophobic Surfaces

Super hydrophobic surfaces have potential applications in the electronics, automobile, and aerospace
industries, offering several benefits in these sectors. Here are some specific applications:

Electronics Industry:

+ Waterproofing Electronics: Super hydrophobic coatings can protect electronic components from water
damage. By applying super hydrophobic coatings on circuit boards, connectors, and other sensitive
electronic parts, water ingress can be minimized, improving the reliability and durability of electronic
devices.

* Moisture Resistance: Electronic devices exposed to humid environments or moisture- prone conditions
can benefit from super hydrophobic coatings. These coatings prevent moisture from reaching critical
electronic components, reducing the risk of short circuits, corrosion, and malfunction.

* Self-Cleaning Displays: Super hydrophobic coatings applied to displays and touch screens repel water,
oils, and fingerprints, making them easier to clean and maintain. This improves the visibility and
functionality of electronic displays, especially in outdoor or high-touch applications.

Automobile Industry:

+ Anti-Fogging Windows and Mirrors: Super hydrophobic coatings can be used on

automobile windows and mirrors to prevent fogging or condensation formation. The water-repellent
property helps maintain clear visibility, enhancing driver safety and comfort in humid or cold weather

conditions.
