29.2 Characteristics of Data Warehouses

may touch a small part of the database and transactions that deal with insertions or
updates of a few tuples per relation to process. Thus, they cannot be optimized for
OLAP, DSS, or data mining. By contrast, data warehouses are designed precisely to
support efficient extraction, processing, and presentation for analytic and decision-
making purposes. In comparison to traditional databases, data warehouses gener-
ally contain very large amounts of data from multiple sources that may include
databases from different data models and sometimes files acquired from indepen-
dent systems and platforms.

29.2 Characteristics of Data Warehouses

To discuss data warehouses and distinguish them from transactional databases
calls for an appropriate data model. The multidimensional data model (explained
in more detail in Section 29.3) is a good fit for OLAP and decision-support tech-
nologies. In contrast to multidatabases, which provide access to disjoint and
usually heterogeneous databases, a data warehouse is frequently a store of inte-
grated data from multiple sources, processed for storage in a multidimensional
model. Unlike most transactional databases, data warehouses typically support
time series and trend analyses along with what-if or predictive-type analyses, all
of which require more historical data than is generally maintained in transac-
tional databases.

Compared with transactional databases, data warehouses are nonvolatile. This
means that information in the data warehouse is typically not subject to modifica-
tion and is often referred to as read/append/purge only. A data warehouse may be
regarded as non-real-time with periodic insertions. In transactional systems, trans-
actions are the unit and are the agent of change to the database; by contrast, data
warehouse information is much more coarse-grained and is refreshed according to a
careful choice of refresh policy, usually incremental. Warehouse insertions are han-
dled by the warehouse’s ETL (extract, transform, load) process, which does a large
amount of preprocessing and which is shown in Figure 29.1. We can also describe
