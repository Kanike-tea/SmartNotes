Let us finally summarize the normalization steps we have discussed so far.

Input Transformation Output
Relation Relation
All Eliminate variable length record. Remove multi-attribute lines in table. INF
Relations
INF — Remove dependency of non-key attributes on part of a multi-attribute 2NF
Relation key.
2NF Remove dependency of non-key attributes on other non-key attributes. 3NF
3NF Remove dependency of an attribute of a multi attribute key on an BCNF
attribute of another (overlapping) multi-attribute key.
BCNF — Remove more than one independent multi-valued dependency from 4NF
relation by splitting relation.
4NF [Add one relation relating attributes with multi-valued dependency.
