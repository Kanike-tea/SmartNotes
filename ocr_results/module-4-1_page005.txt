3. Full Binary Tree
A full binary tree of depth ‘k’ is a binary tree of depth k having 2‘— 1 nodes,k>1.

4. Extended Binary Trees or 2-trees

An extended binary tree is a transformation of any binary tree into a complete binary tree.
This transformation consists of replacing every null subtree of the original tree with
“special nodes.” The nodes from the original tree are then internal nodes, while the special
nodes are external nodes.

For instance, consider the following binary tree.

Binary Tree Extended Binary Tree

The following tree is its extended binary tree. The circles represent internal nodes, and square
represent external nodes.

Every internal node in the extended tree has exactly two children, and every external node is
a leaf. The result is a complete binary tree.
