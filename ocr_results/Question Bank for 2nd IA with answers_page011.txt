Rod Cells

Rod cells are photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye that are responsible for detecting light and
transmitting signals to the brain for the perception of vision, especially in low light conditions.

They contain a protein called rhodopsin that absorbs light and triggers a chain of events leading to

the activation of neural signals. Rods are more sensitive to light than cone cells but do not

distinguish color as well.

Cone Cells

Cone cells are photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye that are responsible for color vision and

visual acuity (sharpness of vision). There are three types of cone cells, each containing a different
photopigment sensitive to different wavelengths of light (red, green, and blue), which allow for

the perception of color. Cones are less sensitive to light than rod cells but provide better visual

acuity and color discrimination. They are concentrated in the fovea, the central part of the retina
responsible for detailed and sharp vision.

Architecture

What is ultrasonography? Explain its uses and working principle.

Ans. Ultrasonography is a medical imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce
images of the internal organs and tissues of the body. It is also known as ultrasound imaging or sonography.
The ultrasound machine emits high-frequency sound waves (usually in the range of 2 to 18 MHz) that
travel through the body and bounce back off of the internal organs and tissues. The returning echoes are
captured by the ultrasound machine and used to create images of the internal structures.

Uses of Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography is a versatile imaging method that is used in a wide range of medical applications.

Some of the most common uses of ultrasonography include:
