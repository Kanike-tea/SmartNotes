and right = n-l. Let middle = (leftt+right)/2 be the middle position in the list. If we compare

list [middle ] with searchnum, we obtain one of three results:

assumption :sorted n(21) distinct integers stored in the array list
return iif list[i] = searchnum;
-1 if no such index exists
denote left and right as left and right ends of the list to
be searched (left=0 & right=n-1) let middle=(leftt+right) /2
middle position in the list
compare list[middle] with searchnum and adjust
left or right compare list[middle] with
searchnum
1) searchnum <
list[middle] set
right to middle-1
2) searchnum =
list[middle] return
middle
3) searchnum >
list[middle] set
left to middle+1
if searchnum has not been found and there are more integers to
check recalculate middle and continue search

int compare(int x, int y)
{
if (x< y) return -1;
else if (x y) return 0; else return 1;

: Algorithm 1.4: Permutations

given a set of n(21)
elements print out all
possible permutations of

this set

e.g. if set {apb,c} is given,
then set of permutations is {(a,b,c), (a,c,b), (b,a,c),
(b,c,a), (c,a,b), (c,b,a) }
