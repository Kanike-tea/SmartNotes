The operations on the min (max) leftist trees are insert, delete, and meld(combine).
The insert and delete-min operations can both be done by using the combine operation.

To insert an element x into a min leftist tree, we first create a min leftist tree that contains the
single element x. Then we combine the two min leftist trees.
To delete the min element from a nonempty min leftist tree, we combine the min leftist trees
root->LeftChild and root->RightChild and delete the node root.
To meld(combine) two min-leftist trees
Choose minimum root of the two trees, A and B.

Leave the left subtree of smaller root (suppose A) unchanged and combine the right subtree
of Awwith B. Back to step 1, until no remaining vertices.
Compare shortest(x) and swap to make it satisfy the definition of leftist trees.
