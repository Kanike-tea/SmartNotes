22, It has been found from experience that the mean breaking strength of a particular brand
of thread is 275.6 gms with standard deviation of 39.7 gms. Recently a sample of 36 pieces
of thread showed a mean breaking strength of 253.2 gms. Can one conclude at a
significance level of (a) 0.05 (b) 0.01 that the thread has become inferior?

>> We have to decide between the two hypothesis
Hy : = 275.6gms, mean breaking strength
Ay: <: 275.6 gms, inferiorin breakingstrength.

We choose the one tailed test.

Mean breaking strength of a sample of 36 pieces = 253.2
difference= 275.6 - 253.2 = 22.4 jn = 36

* The value of Z is greater than the critical value of Z= 1.645 at 5% level and 2.33 at 1%

level of significance.

Under the hypothesis H, that the thread has become inferior is accepted at both

0.05 and 0.01 levels in accordence with one tailed test.

23. Inan examination given to students at a large number of different schools the mean grade
was 74.5 and S.D grade was 8. At one particular school where 200 students took the
examination the mean grade was 75.9. Discuss the significance of this result from the view
point of (a) one tailed test (b) two tailed test at both 5% and 1% level of significance.

> Hy : & = 74.5 and there is no change in the mean grade.
Hy: #745 ie, > 745 and p < 745.
}. = 74.5 and mean of a sample of size 200 (n) is 75.9
. difference= 75.9-74.5 = 14

We have the table for the critical values of Z in the case of one and two tailed tests.
