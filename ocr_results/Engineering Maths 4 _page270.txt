Consider w =e".

ie, utiv= et = ee or utio = & (cosytisiny) :

u=ecosy, 0=esiny ssi(h)

 Weshiall find the image in the w— plane corresponding to the straight lines parallel to

the co-ordinate axes in the z~plane. That isx = constantand y = constant.
Letuseliminate x and y separately.from (1).
Squaring and adding we get

Pre = et . --(2)
Also by dividing we get ui = ésiny
: - =e uo cosy 2
*s Z -
we, : i = tany . ; -++ (3)

Case1: Let x = ¢, where ¢, isa constan’
Equation (2) becomes u*+0* = e% = constant = ?P (cay).
This represents a circle with centre origin and radius r in the w— plane.

. Case-2: Let y = Cy where Cis a constant.

Equation (8) becomes = = tanc, =-m(say) “. v=mu

“This represents a straight line passing through the origin in the w— plane.

Conclusig

1% : The t aight line parallel to
y cs

- -z-plane w- plane

the x-axis (y = c,) inthe z- plane maps onto a straight line passing through the
origin in the w—plane. The straight line parallel to the y-axis (x = ¢,) in the

z— plane maps onto a circle with centre origin and radius r where r = et in the
w-plan. “
