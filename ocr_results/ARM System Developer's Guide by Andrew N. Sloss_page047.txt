= Fastinterrupt request vectoris similar to the interrupt request but is reserved for hardware
requiring faster response times. It can only be raised if FIQs are not masked in the cpsr.

2.5 CORE EXTENSIONS

The hardware extensions covered in this section are standard components placed next to the
ARM core. They improve performance, manage resources, and provide extra functionality
and are designed to provide flexibility in handling particular applications. Each ARM family
has different extensions available.

There are three hardware extensions ARM wraps around the core: cache and tightly
coupled memory, memory management, and the coprocessor interface.

2.5.1 CACHE AND TIGHTLY COUPLED MEMORY

The cache is a block of fast memory placed between main memory and the core. It allows for
more efficient fetches from some memory types. With a cache the processor core can run
for the majority of the time without having to wait for data from slow external memory.
Most ARM-based embedded systems use a single-level cache internal to the processor.
Ofcourse, many small embedded systems do not require the performance gains that a
cache brings.

ARM has two forms of cache. The first is found attached to the Von Neumann-style
cores. It combines both data and instruction into a single unified cache, as shown in
Figure 2.13. For simplicity, we have called the glue logic that connects the memory system
to the AMBA bus logic and control.
