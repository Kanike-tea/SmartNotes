Since represents the slope at any point of the curve y(x, y) = ¢, we conclude

that the resultant velocity V = | Vi = Vie + A of the fluid’ particlei isalong the tangent
to the curve w(x, y) = c. The fluid vutitlens move along this curve.

w(x, y) iscalled the stream function.

The family of curves $(x, y) =constant are known as equipotential lines and the.
family of curves w(x, y) = constant are known as stream lines. .

Recalling the second property of analytic functions, [Orthogonal property :Article3.52]

we conclude that the equipotential lines ¢(x, y) =constant and stream lines
w(x, y) = cosntant intersect each other orthogonally.

That is to say that the magnitude of fluid velocity is equal to the modulus of f’ (z).

The flow pattern fully represented by w = f(z) is called the complex potential. ,

Note: In electrostatic problems (x, y) = c,and w(x, y) = cp.are respectively known nek

as equipotential lines and lines of ‘force.

In heat flow problems (x,y) = ¢, and w(x, y) = c, are on known as. «

isothermals and heat flow lines.
