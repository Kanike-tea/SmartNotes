— constant-value 4( which is used to increment PC content).

An instruction is executed by performing one or more of the following operations:
1) Transfer a word of data from one register to another or to the ALU.
2) Perform arithmetic or a logic operation and store the result in a register.
3) Fetch the contents of a given memory-location and load them into a register.
4) Store a word of data from a register into a given memory-location.
¢ Disadvantage: Only one data-word can be transferred over the bus in a clock cycle.
Solution: Provide multiple internal-paths. Multiple paths allow several data-transfers to take place in
Parallel.

EXECUTION OF A COMPLETE INSTRUCTION:

Let us now put together the sequence of elementary operations required to execute one instruction.
Consider the instruction Add (R3), R1 which adds the contents of a memory location pointed to by R3 to
register R1. Executing this instruction requires the following actions:

1. Fetch the instruction. 2. Fetch the first operand (the contents of the memory location pointed to by
R3). 3. Perform the addition. 4 .Load the result into RI.

Above indicates the sequence of control steps required to perform these operations for the single-bus
architecture of Figure 2. Instruction execution proceeds as follows. In step 1, the instruction fetch
operation is initiated by loading the contents of the PC into the MAR and sending a Read request to the
memory. The Select signal is set to Select4, which causes the multiplexer MUX to select the constant 4.
This value is added to the operand at input B, which is the contents of the PC, and the result is stored in
register Z. The updated value is moved from register Z back into the PC during step 2, while waiting for
the memory to respond. In step 3, the word fetched from the memory is loaded into the IR. Steps |
through 3 constitute the instruction fetch phase, which is the same for all instructions. The instruction
decoding circuit interprets the contents of the IR at the beginning of step 4. This enables the control
circuitry to activate the control signals for steps 4 through 7, which constitute the execution phase. The
contents of register R3 are transferred to the MAR in step 4, and a memory read operation is initiated.
