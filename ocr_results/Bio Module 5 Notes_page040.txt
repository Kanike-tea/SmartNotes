Comparisons between Human nose and electronic nose:

Aspect Human Nose Electronic Nose
Sensing Olfactory receptor cells in the nasal | Electronic sensors detect and analyze
Mechanism cavity detect odor molecules chemical properties of odor molecules

Odor Perception

Humans can perceive a wide range
of distinct odors

Electronic nose can identify and

differentiate various odors, but may
not perceive them in the same way as
humans

Human sense of smell is highly

Electronic sensors can have high
