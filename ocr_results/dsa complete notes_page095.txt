The Satisfiability problem
¢ Conisder the set of formulas that we can construct by taking the variables x1,x2,...... xn and
operators ~(AND) V v(OR) and = (NOT)
e The variables can hold any one of the two possible values true or false.
e The set of expressions that can be formed using these variables and operators is defined by
the following rules.
1. A variable is an expression
2. Ifxand y are expressions then ax, xy, xvy are expressions
3. Order of evaluation first = then A then v.
4. Parenthesis can be used to alter the normal order of evaluations.

Defintion: The satisfiability problem for formulas of the propositional calculus asks if there is an
assignment of values to the variables that causes the value of the expression to be true.

Example: Representation of the expression (x1 A 4x2) v (=x1 A x3) v ax3 as a binary tree

Propositional formula in a binary Tree
Inorder Traversal of the tree is xl A 4 x2 v 4x1 A x3 v 7x3 this is the infix form of the expression.

Note: The node containing — has only a right branch since — is a unary operator.
