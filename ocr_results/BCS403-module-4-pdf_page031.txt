Database Management System [BCS403]

= Transaction T1
+ transfers N reservations from one flight whose number of reserved _ seats is stored
in the database item named X to another flight whose number of reserved seats is
stored in the database item named Y.

= Transaction T2

+ reserves M seats on the first flight (X)

1. The Lost Update Problem
= occurs when two transactions that access the same DB items have their operations
interleaved in a way that makes the value of some DB item incorrect
= Suppose that transactions T1 and T2 are submitted at approximately the same time, and

suppose that their operations are interleaved as shown in Figure below

qT; To
read_item(X);
X=X-N;
read_item(X);
X =X+M;

Time | | write_item(X);
read_item(Y); a Item X has an incorrect value because
wmiteditem(), its update by 7, is /ost (overwritten).

Y=Y4+N;
1 write_item(Y);

= Final value of item X is incorrect because T2 reads the value of X before T1 changes it in
the database, and hence the updated value resulting from 71 is lost.
= For example:
X = 80 at the start (there were 80 reservations on the flight)
N = 5 (11 transfers 5 seat reservations from the flight corresponding
to X to the flight corresponding to Y)
M = 4 (T2 reserves 4 seats on X)
The final result should be X = 79.
= The interleaving of operations shown in Figure is X = 84 because the update in T1 that

removed the five seats from X was lost.
