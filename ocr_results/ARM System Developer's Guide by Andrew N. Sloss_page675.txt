taken. Each time the branch is taken, the state moves one to the right in this list (if it can),
and each time the branch is not taken, the state moves one to the left in this list (if it can).
A return stack predicts unconditional subroutine return instructions. The stack has three
entries storing the return address from the three deepest BL, BLX subroutine calls.
Table D.14 gives the ARM11 instruction cycle timings.

Table D.14 ARM11 (ARMv6) instruction cycle timings.

Instruction class Cycles Notes
ALU operations except a 1 Rmis required one cycle early if shifted by a constant shift.
MOV to pc (for MOV to
pc, see BX) +1 if a register-specified shift is used. In this case Rs is
required one cycle early and Rnis not required until the second
cycle.
+6 if Rdis pe.

B <immed> 1 Assumes successful dynamic prediction. Some dynamically

BL <immed> predicted branches may be folded, to be zero cycles.

BLX <immed>
+3 for successful static prediction.
+4 for unsuccessful static or dynamic prediction. In this case
the flags are required two cycles early.

BX Ir 4 +1 if unconditional and return stack is empty.

MOV pe, Ir +3 if unconditional and return stack mispredicts.
+1 if conditional. In this case the flags are required two cycles
early.

BX Rm (not Ir) 5 If no shift on MOV and conditional, the flags are required two

BLX Rm cycles early.

MOV pc, Rm (not Ir) +1 if a constant shift is used for MOV. In this case Rm is required
one cycle early. If conditional, then the flags are required one
cycle early.
+2 if a register-specified shift is used for MOV. In this case Rs is
required one cycle early, and Rn is not used until the second
cycle.

cPS 1 +1 ifa mode change occurs.

LDR/B/H/SB/SH/D A Rd is not available for two cycles. R(d + 1)is not available

Rd not pe for two cycles for LDRD.

If the load is potentially unaligned (base or offset unaligned),
then you cannot start another memory access on the next cycle.
If the load is unaligned, then Rd is not available for three cycles
for LDR/H/SH. For LDRD Rd is not available for two cycles and
R(d + 1) for three cycles.
