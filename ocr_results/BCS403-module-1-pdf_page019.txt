Database Management System [BCS403]

Database state or snapshot

The distinction between database schema and database state is very important. When we define a

new database, we specify its database schema only to the DBMS. At this point, the corresponding
database state is the empty state with no data. We get the initial state of the database when the

database is first populated or loaded with the initial data. From then on, every time an update

Operation is applied to the database, we get another database state. At any point in time, the
database has a current state.

The DBMS is partly responsible for ensuring that every state of the database is a valid state—that

is, a state that satisfies the structure and constraints specified in the schema. The

DBMS stores the descriptions of the schema constructs.and_constraints—also called the meta-

data—in the DBMS catalog so that DBMS software can refer to the schema whenever it needs to.
The schema is sometimes called the intension, and a database state is called an extension of the

schema.

2.2 Three-Schema Architecture and Data Independence

The goal of the three-schema architecture is to separate the user applications from the physical
database. In this architecture, schemas can be defined at the following three levels:
1. The internal level has an internal schema, which describes the physical storage
structure of the database. The internal schema uses a physical data model and describes the
complete details of data storage and access paths for the database.

2. The conceptual level has a Conceptiallschemiay Which describes the structire of the! whole

3. The external or view level includes a number of external schemas or user views. Each
external schema describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested

in and hides the rest of the database from that user group. Each external schema is typically
