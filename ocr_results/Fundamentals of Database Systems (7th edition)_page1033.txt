26.5 Introduction to Deductive Databases

P(41, 49, ... , Ay), Where p is the predicate name and n is the number of arguments
for predicate p. Different predicate symbols can have different numbers of argu-
ments, and the number of arguments n of predicate p is sometimes called the arity
or degree of p. The arguments can be either constant values or variable names. As
mentioned earlier, we use the convention that constant values either are numeric
or start with a lowercase character, whereas variable names always start with an
uppercase character.

A number of built-in predicates are included in Datalog and can also be used to con-
struct atomic formulas. The built-in predicates are of two main types: the binary com-
parison predicates < (less), <= (less_or_equal), > (greater), and >= (greater_or_equal)
over ordered domains; and the comparison predicates = (equal) and /= (not_equal) over
ordered or unordered domains. These can be used as binary predicates with the same
functional syntax as other predicates—for example, by writing less(X, 3)—or they can
be specified by using the customary infix notation X<3. Note that because the domains
of these predicates are potentially infinite, they should be used with care in rule defini-
tions. For example, the predicate greater(X, 3), if used alone, generates an infinite set of
values for X that satisfy the predicate (all integer numbers greater than 3).

A literal is either an atomic formula as defined earlier—called a positive literal—or an
atomic formula preceded by not. The latter is a negated atomic formula, called a
negative literal. Datalog programs can be considered to be a subset of the predicate
calculus formulas, which are somewhat similar to the formulas of the domain relational
calculus (see Section 6.7). In Datalog, however, these formulas are first converted into
what is known as clausal form before they are expressed in Datalog, and only formulas
given ina restricted clausal form, called Horn clauses, can be used in Datalog.

26.5.4 Clausal Form and Horn Clauses

Recall from Section 6.6 that a formula in the relational calculus is a condition that
includes predicates called atoms (based on relation names). Additionally, a formula
can have quantifiers—namely, the universal quantifier (for all) and the existential
quantifier (there exists). In clausal form, a formula must be transformed into
another formula with the following characteristics:

= All variables in the formula are universally quantified. Hence, it is not neces-
sary to include the universal quantifiers (for all) explicitly; the quantifiers
are removed, and all variables in the formula are implicitly quantified by the
universal quantifier.

= In clausal form, the formula is made up of a number of clauses, where each
clause is composed of a number of literals connected by OR logical connec-
tives only. Hence, each clause is a disjunction of literals.

= The clauses themselves are connected by AND logical connectives only, to form
a formula. Hence, the clausal form of a formula is a conjunction of clauses.
