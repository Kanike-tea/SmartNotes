Database Management System [BCS403]

The rows and columns represent the values of the results of comparison conditions, which would
typically appear in the WHERE clause of an SQL query.

In select-project-join queries, the general rule is that only those combinations of tuples that evaluate
the logical expression in the WHERE clause of the query to TRUE are selected. Tuple combinations
that evaluate to FALSE or UNKNOWN are not selected.

SQL allows queries that check whether an attribute value is NULL using the comparison operators
IS or IS NOT.
Example: Retrieve the names of all employees who do not have supervisors.
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Super_ssn IS NULL;
1.1.2 Nested Queries, Tuples, and Set/Multiset Comparisons
Some queries require that existing values in the database be fetched and then used in a
comparison condition. Such queries can be conveniently formulated by using nested queries,
which are complete select-from-where blocks within the WHERE clause of another query. That
other query is called the outer query
Example1: List the project numbers of projects that have an employee with last name ‘Smith’ as
manager
SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber FROM PROJECT WHERE
Pnumber IN
(SELECT Pnumber FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dnum=Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn=Ssn AND Lname='‘smith’);
Example2; List the project numbers of projects that have an employee with last name ‘Smith’ as
either manager or as worker.
SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber FROM PROJECT WHERE
Pnumber IN
(SELECT Pnumber FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dnum=Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn=Ssn AND Lname='‘smith’)
OR
Pnumber IN
(SELECT Pno FROM WORKS_ON, EMPLOYEE WHERE Essn=Ssn AND
Lname='‘smith’);
We make use of comparison operator IN, which compares a value v with a set (or multiset) of
values V and evaluates to TRUE if vis one of the elements in V.
