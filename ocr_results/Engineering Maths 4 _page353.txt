Note: If X and Y are independent random variables then
(i) E(XY) = E(X)-E(Y)
(ii) COV(X, Y) = 0 andhence p(X, Y) = 0
Remark: COV(X, X) = Tai V(X) = oy

® Continuous random variables a
Let X and Y be two continuous random variables. If f(x, y) is a real valued - °
function satisfying the conditions .

f(x,y) 20 and ff fx, y) dx dy=1

then f(x, y) is called the joint probability function or.the’ joint spate function of the

random variables X and Y
