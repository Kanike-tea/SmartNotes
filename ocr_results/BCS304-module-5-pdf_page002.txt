e Example 1:
Solution: Let key=2345, Its square is K? =574525
H (2345) =45=>by discarding 57 and 25

e Example 2: Calculate the hash value for keys 1234 using the mid-square method. The hash
table has 100 memory locations.
Solution: Note that the hash table has 100 memory locations whose indices vary from 0 to 99.
This means that only two digits are needed to map the key to a location in the hash table.
When k = 1234, k* = 1522756, h (1234) = 27.

3. Folding Method:

Step 1: Divide the key value into a number of parts. That is, divide k into parts k1, k2, ..., kn,
where each part has the same number of digits except the last part which may have lesser digits

than the other parts.

Step 2: Add the individual parts. That is, obtain the sum of kI + k2 + ... + kn. The hash value is

produced by ignoring the last carry, if any.

Note that the number of digits in each part of the key will vary depending upon the size of the

hash table.

5.0.4 Collision Resolution Techniques

Figure 10.5 shows a hash table in which each key from the set K is mapped to locations generated by

using a hash function. Note that keys k2 and k6 point to the same memory location. This is known as
collision. That is, when two or more keys map to the same memory location, a collision Figure 5.18
