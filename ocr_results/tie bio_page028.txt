Photovoltaic cells:

The sun’s energy is captured by two engineering systems: photosynthetic plant cells
and photovoltaic cells (PV).

Photosynthesis converts solar energy into chemical energy, delivering different types
of products such as building blocks, bio fuels, and biomass;

Photovoltaic's turn solar energy into electricity which can be stored and used to
perform work.

A solar cell, or photovoltaic cell, is an electronic device that converts the energy of
light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and
chemical phenomenon.

It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics,
such as current, voltage, or resistance, vary when exposed to light.

Human Blood substitutes :

Shortages in blood supplies and concerns about the safety of donated blood have
fueled the development of so-called blood substitutes.

The two major types of blood substitutes are volume expanders and oxygen
therapeutics.

Volume expanders: They include solutions such as saline that are used to replace lost
plasma volume.

Haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs): They are also called Oxygen
therapeutics. These are agents designed to replace oxygen normally carried by the
hemoglobin in red blood cells.
