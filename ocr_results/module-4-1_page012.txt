4. Iterative inorder Traversal:
Iterative inorder traversal explicitly make use of stack function.
The left nodes are pushed into stack until a null node is reached, the node is then removed from
the stack and displayed, and the node’s right child is stacked until a null node is reached. The
traversal then continues with the left child. The traversal is complete when the stack is empty.

void iterInorder(treePointer node)
{
int top = -1; /* initialize stack */
treePointer stack [MAX-STACK-SIZE};
for (33) 1
for(; node; node = node-leftChild)
push(node); /* add to stack */
node = pop(); /* delete from stack */
if (!node) break; empty stack */
printf("%d", node-sdata);
node = node-srightChil

)

5. Level-Order traversal:

Visiting the nodes using the ordering suggested by the node numbering is called level
ordering traversing.

The nodes in a tree are numbered starting with the root on level 1 and so on.

Firstly visit the root, then the root’s left child, followed by the root’s right child. Thus
continuing in this manner, visiting the nodes at each new level from the leftmost node to the
rightmost node.

Level order traversal: 1 23 45

Initially in the code for level order add the root to the queue. The function operates by
deleting the node at the front of the queue, printing the nodes data field and adding the nodes
left and right children to the queue.
