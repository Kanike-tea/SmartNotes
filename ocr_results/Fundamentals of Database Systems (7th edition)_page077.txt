application program execution, and user interface processing were carried out on
one machine. Figure 2.4 illustrates the physical components in a centralized archi-
tecture. Gradually, DBMS systems started to exploit the available processing power
at the user side, which led to client/server DBMS architectures.

2.5.2 Basic Client/Server Architectures

First, we discuss client/server architecture in general; then we discuss how it is
applied to DBMSs. The client/server architecture was developed to deal with com-
puting environments in which a large number of PCs, workstations, file servers,
printers, database servers, Web servers, e-mail servers, and other software and
equipment are connected via a network. The idea is to define specialized servers
with specific functionalities. For example, it is possible to connect a number of PCs
or small workstations as clients to a file server that maintains the files of the client
machines. Another machine can be designated as a printer server by being con-
nected to various printers; all print requests by the clients are forwarded to this
machine. Web servers or e-mail servers also fall into the specialized server cate-
gory. The resources provided by specialized servers can be accessed by many client
machines. The client machines provide the user with the appropriate interfaces to
utilize these servers, as well as with local processing power to run local applications.
This concept can be carried over to other software packages, with specialized pro-
grams—such as a CAD (computer-aided design) package—being stored on specific
server machines and being made accessible to multiple clients. Figure 2.5 illustrates
