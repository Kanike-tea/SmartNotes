This intermediate layer or middle tier is called the application server or the Web
server, depending on the application. This server plays an intermediary role by
running application programs and storing business rules (procedures or con-
straints) that are used to access data from the database server. It can also improve
database security by checking a client’s credentials before forwarding a request to
the database server. Clients contain user interfaces and Web browsers. The inter-
mediate server accepts requests from the client, processes the request and sends
database queries and commands to the database server, and then acts as a conduit
for passing (partially) processed data from the database server to the clients, where
it may be processed further and filtered to be presented to the users. Thus, the user
interface, application rules, and data access act as the three tiers. Figure 2.7(b) shows
another view of the three-tier architecture used by database and other application
package vendors. The presentation layer displays information to the user and allows
data entry. The business logic layer handles intermediate rules and constraints before
data is passed up to the user or down to the DBMS. The bottom layer includes all
data management services. The middle layer can also act as a Web server, which
retrieves query results from the database server and formats them into dynamic
Web pages that are viewed by the Web browser at the client side. The client machine
is typically a PC or mobile device connected to the Web.

Other architectures have also been proposed. It is possible to divide the layers
between the user and the stored data further into finer components, thereby giving
rise to n-tier architectures, where n may be four or five tiers. Typically, the business
logic layer is divided into multiple layers. Besides distributing programming and
data throughout a network, n-tier applications afford the advantage that any one
tier can run on an appropriate processor or operating system platform and can be
handled independently. Vendors of ERP (enterprise resource planning) and CRM
(customer relationship management) packages often use a middleware layer, which
