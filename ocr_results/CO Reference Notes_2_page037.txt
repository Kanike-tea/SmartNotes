Figure 4.38 An example of a computer system using different interface standards.

Problem 1:
The input status bit in an interface-circuit is cleared as soon as the input data register is read. Why is
this important?
Solution:
After reading the input data, it is necessary to clear the input status flag before the program
begins a new read-operation. Otherwise, the same input data would be read a second time.

Problem 2:

What is the difference between a subroutine and an interrupt-service routine?

Solution:
A subroutine is called by a program instruction to perform a function needed by the calling
program.
An interrupt-service routine is initiated by an event such as an input operation or a hardware
error. The function it performs may not be at all related to the program being executed at the
time of interruption. Hence, it must not affect any of the data or status information relating to
that program.

Problem 3:

Three devices A, B, & C are connected to the bus of a computer. I/O transfers for all 3 devices use
interrupt control. Interrupt nesting for devices A & B is not allowed, but interrupt-requests from C may
be accepted while either A or B is being serviced. Suggest different ways in which this can be
accomplished in each of the following cases:

(a) The computer has one interrupt-request line.

(b) Two interrupt-request lines INTR1 & INTR2 are available, with INTR1 having higher

priority. Specify when and how interrupts are enabled and disabled in each case.

Solution:
