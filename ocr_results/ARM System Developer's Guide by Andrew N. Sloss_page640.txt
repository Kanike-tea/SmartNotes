A.4 ARM Assembler Quick Reference 627

This directive is similar to #def ine in C. It defines a symbol <name> with value defined by
the expression. This value cannot be redefined. See Section A.4.1 for the use of redefinable
variables.

EXPORT (alias GLOBAL)
EXPORT <symbol>{ [WEAK] }

Assembler symbols are local to the object file unless exported using this command. You
can link exported symbols with other object and library files. The optional [WEAK] suffix
indicates that the linker should try and resolve references with other instances of this symbol
before using this instance.

EXTERN, IMPORT

EXTERN <symbol>{ [WEAK] }
IMPORT <symbo1>{ [WEAK] }

Both of these directives declare the name of an external symbol, defined in another object
file or library. If you use this symbol, then the linker will resolve it at link time. For IMPORT,
the symbol will be resolved even if you don’t use it. For EXTERN, only used symbols are
resolved. If you declare the symbol as [WEAK], then no error is generated if the linker
cannot resolve the symbol; instead the symbol takes the value 0.

FIELD (alias #)
See MAP.

FUNCTION (alias PROC) and ENDFUNC (alias ENDP)

The FUNCTION and ENDFUNC directives mark the start and end of an ATPCS-compliant
function. Their main use is to improve the debug view and allow backtracking of function
calls during debugging. They also allow the profiler to more accurately profile assembly
functions. You must precede the function directive with the ATPCS function name. For
example:

sub FUNCTION
suB sr, 0, rl
MOV pc, Ir
ENDFUNC

GBLA, GBLL, GBLS

Directives defining global arithmetic, logic, and string variables, respectively. See
Section A.4.1.
