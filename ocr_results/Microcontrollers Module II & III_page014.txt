i. Preindex with writeback
ii. Preindex, and postindex
Table 4 shows different indexing methods.

Table 4: Indexing Methods

Base address

Index method Data register Example
Preindex with writeback mem|base + offset] base + offset LOR rO,[r1,#4]!
Preindex mem|base + offset] not updated LOR rO,[r1, #4]
Postindex mem|base] base + offset LOR rO, [rl] ,#4

Note: ! indicates that the instruction writes the calculated address back to the base address register.

Preindex with writeback calculates an address from a base register plus address offset and
then updates that address base register with the new address. In contrast, the preindex offset
is the same as the preindex with writeback but does not update the address base register.
Postindex only updates the address base register after the address is used. The preindex mode
is useful for accessing an element in a data structure. The postindex and preindex with
writeback modes are useful for traversing an array.
Example:
PRE 10 = 0x00000000, rl = 0x00090000, mem32[0x00009000] = 0x01010101,
mem32[0x00009004] = 0x02020202

LDR 10, [rl, #4]!
Preindexing with writeback:
POST(1) 10 = 0x02020202, rl = 0x00009004
LDR 10, [rl, #4]
Preindexing:
POST(2) r0 = 0x02020202, rl = 0x00009000
LDR 10, [rl], #4
Postindexing:
POST(3) r0 = 0x01010101, rl = 0x00009004

The addressing modes available with a particular load or store instruction depend on the
instruction class. Table 5 shows the addressing modes available for load and store of a 32-bit
word or an unsigned byte.
