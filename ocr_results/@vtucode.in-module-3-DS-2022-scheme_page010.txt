DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

Here Depth of tree is 3

- In any tree, ‘Depth of Node’ is
total number of Edges from root
to that node.

In any tree, ‘Depth of Tree’ is
total number of edges from root
to leaf in the longest path.

12. Path

In a tree data structure, the sequence of Nodes and Edges from one node to, another node is
called as PATH between the two Nodes. Length of a Path is total number of nodes in that path.
In below example the path A - B - E- J has length 4.

(A) - Inany tree, ‘Path’ isa sequence
of nédes afd edges between two

Here, ‘Path’ between A& Jis
A-B-E-J

Here, ‘Path’ between C & K is
C-G-K

13. Sub Tree
In a tree data structure, each child from a node forms a subtree recursively. Every child node

will form a subtree on its parent node.

Subtree
Subtree

The ancestors of a node are all the nodes along the path from the root to that node.

Ex: ancestor of j is B & A

A forest is a set of n 0 disjoint trees. The notion of a forest is very close to that of a tree because
if we remove the root of a tree we get a forest. For example, in figure 1 if we remove A we get

a forest with three trees.
