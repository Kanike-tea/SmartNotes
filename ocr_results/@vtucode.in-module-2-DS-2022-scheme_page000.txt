QUEUES ABSTRACT DATA TYPE

DEFINITION

“A queue is an ordered list in which insertions (additions, pushes) and deletions (removals and
pops) take place at different ends.”

The end at which new elements are added is called the rear, and that from which old elements

are deleted is called the front.

Given a queue Q = (ao, ai,.. -. Ant) , ao, is the front element ag) is the rear element, ai+1 is

behind aj 0< =i <n-1.
If the elements are inserted A, B, C, D and E in this order, then A is the first element deleted
from the queue. Since the first element inserted into a queue is the first element removed,

queues are also known as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) lists.

QUEUE REPRESENTATION USING ARRAY

Queues may be represented by one-way lists or linear arrays.

Queues will be maintained by a linear array QUEUE and two pointer variables: FRONT-
containing the location of the front element of the queue

REAR-containing the location of the rear element of the queue.

The condition FRONT = NULL will indicate that the queue is empty.

Figure indicates the way elements will be deleted from the queue and the way new elements
will be added to the queue.

Whenever an element is deleted from the queue, the value of FRONT is increased by 1; this
can be implemented by the assignment FRONT := FRONT + 1

When an element is added to the queue, the value of REAR is increased by 1; this can be

implemented by the assignment REAR := REAR + 1
