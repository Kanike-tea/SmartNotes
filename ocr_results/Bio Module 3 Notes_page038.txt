A defibrillator is a medical device that delivers an electric shock to the heart to restore its
normal rhythm in cases of cardiac arrest or other life-threatening heart rhythm disorders.
Defibrillators can be external (placed on the chest) or internal (implanted within the body).

The basic design of a defibrillator consists of:

0 Power source: The power source, typically a battery, provides energy to deliver the electric
shock to the heart.

U Electrodes: The electrodes are placed on the chest and deliver the electric shock to the heart.
O Circuitry: The circuitry in the defibrillator controls the delivery of the electric shock,
including the timing, strength, and duration of the shock.

O Display: A display on the defibrillator provides information about the heart rhythm, battery
life, and other relevant information.

Automated External Defibrillators

External defibrillators, also known as automated external defibrillators (AEDs), are designed
for use by laypeople and are commonly found in public places such as airports, shopping
centers, and schools. They are relatively simple in design and typically have voice prompts and
visual cues to guide the user through the process of delivering the electric shock.

Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators

Internal defibrillators, also known as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), are
surgically implanted within the body and are used to treat people with a high risk of sudden
cardiac arrest. They are typically more complex in design, including features such as
continuous monitoring of the heart rhythm, and automatic delivery of shocks when necessary.
