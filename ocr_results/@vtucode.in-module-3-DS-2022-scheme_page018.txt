DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

Linked representation:
The problems in array representation are:

e It is good for complete binary trees, but more memory is wasted for skewed and

many other binary trees.
e The insertion and deletion of nodes from the middle ofa tree require the

movement of many nodes to reflect the change in level number of these nodes.
These problems can be easily overcome by linked representation

Each node has three fields

e LeftChild - which contains the address of left subtree
e RightChild - which contains the address of right subtree.
e Data - which contains the actual information

C Code for node:

typedef struct node *treepointer;
typedef struct
{
int data;
treepointer leftChild, rightChild
}node;
leftChild data rightChild | (a
leftChild rightChild
