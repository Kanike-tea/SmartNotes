mapping steps. We assume that the mapping will create tables with simple single-
valued attributes. The relational model constraints defined in Chapter 5, which
include primary keys, unique keys (if any), and referential integrity constraints on
the relations, will also be specified in the mapping results.

Step 1: Mapping of Regular Entity Types. For each regular (strong) entity type
E in the ER schema, create a relation R that includes all the simple attributes of E.
Include only the simple component attributes of a composite attribute. Choose one
of the key attributes of E as the primary key for R. If the chosen key of E is a com-
posite, then the set of simple attributes that form it will together form the primary
key of R.

If multiple keys were identified for E during the conceptual design, the information
describing the attributes that form each additional key is kept in order to specify
additional (unique) keys of relation R. Knowledge about keys is also kept for index-
ing purposes and other types of analyses.

In our example, we create the relations EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, and PROJECT in
Figure 9.2 to correspond to the regular entity types EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, and
PROJECT from Figure 9.1. The foreign key and relationship attributes, if any,
are not included yet; they will be added during subsequent steps. These include
