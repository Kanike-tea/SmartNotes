Types of attributes:
1.Composite versus Simple (Atomic) Attributes
2.Single-valued versus multivalued
3.Stored versus derived
4.NULL values
5.Complex attributes
1. Composite versus Simple (Atomic) Attributes

Composite Attributes can be divided into smaller subparts, which represent more basic

attributes with independent meanings.For example, the Address attribute of the

EMPLOYEE entity can be subdivided into Street_address, City, State, and Zip.

Composite attributes can form a hierarchy. For example, Street_address can be further

subdivided into three simple component attributes: Number, Street, and

Apartment_number. The value of a composite attribute is the concatenation of the values of

its component simple attributes.
