15.4 Future Technologies beyond ARMv6 563

15.3 ARMV6 IMPLEMENTATIONS

ARM completed development of ARM1136] in December 2002, and at this writing con-
sumer products are being designed with this core. The ARM1136J pipeline is the most
sophisticated ARM implementation to date. As shown in Figure 15.4, it has an eight-stage
pipeline with separate parallel pipelines for load/store and multiply/accumulate.

‘The parallel load/store unit (LSU) with hit-under-miss capability allows load and store
operations to be issued and execution to continue while the load or store is completing with
the slower memory system. By decoupling the execution pipeline from the completion of
loads or stores, the core can gain considerable extra performance since the memory system
is typically many times slower than the core speed. Hit-under-miss extends this decoupling
out to the L1-L2 memory interface so that an L1 cache miss can occur and an L2 transaction
can be completing while other L1 hits are still going on.

Another big change in microarchitecture is the move from virtually tagged caches to
physically tagged caches. Traditionally, ARM has used virtually tagged caches where the
MMUis between the caches and the outside L2 memory system. With ARM6, this changes
so that the MMU is now between the core and the L1 caches, so that all cache memory
accesses are using physical (already translated) addresses. One of the big benefits of this
approach is considerably reduced cache flushing on context switches when the ARM is
running large operating systems. This reduced flushing will also reduce power consumption
in the end system since cache flushing directly implies more external memory accesses. In
some cases it is expected that this architectural change will deliver up to a 20% performance
improvement.

15.4 FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES BEYOND ARMv6

In 2003, ARM made further technology announcements including TrustZone and
Thumb-2. While these technologies are very new, at this writing, they are being included
in new microprocessor cores. The next sections briefly introduce these new technologies.

15.4.1 TRUSTZONE

TrustZone is an architectural extension targeting the security of transactions that may be
carried out using consumer products such as cell phones and, in the future, perhaps online
transactions to download music or video for example. It was first introduced in October
2003 when ARM announced the ARM1176JZ-S.

The fundamental idea is that operating systems (even on embedded devices) are now
so complex that it is very hard to verify security and correctness in the software. The ARM
solution to this problem is to add new operating “states” to the architecture where only a
small verifiable software kernel will run, and this will provide services to the larger operating
system. The microprocessor core then takes a role in controlling system peripherals that
