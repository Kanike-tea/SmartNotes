An electrical stimulus is generated in a special part of the heart muscle called the sinus
node. It's also called the sinoatrial node (SA node). The sinus node is a small mass of special
tissue in the right upper chamber of the heart (right atrium). In an adult, the sinus node sends
out a regular electrical pulse 60 to 100 times per minute. This electrical pulse travels down
through the conduction pathways and causes the heart's lower chambers (ventricles) to contract
and pump out blood. The right and left atria are stimulated first and contract to push blood from
the atria into the ventricles. The ventricles then contract to push blood out into the blood vessels
of the body.
