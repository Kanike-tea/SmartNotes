FIGURE 3.9 First few iterations of solving a small instance of the assignment problem
by exhaustive search.

Since the number of permutations to be considered for the general case of the
assignment problem is n!, exhaustive search is impractical for all but very small
instances of the problem. Fortunately, there is a much more efficient algorithm for
this problem called the Hungarian method after the Hungarian mathematicians
K®6nig and Egervary, whose work underlies the method (see, e.g., [Kol95]).

This is good news: the fact that a problem domain grows exponentially or
faster does not necessarily imply that there can be no efficient algorithm for solving
it. In fact, we present several other examples of such problems later in the book.
However, such examples are more of an exception to the rule. More often than
not, there are no known polynomial-time algorithms for problems whose domain
grows exponentially with instance size, provided we want to solve them exactly.
And, as we mentioned above, such algorithms quite possibly do not exist.
