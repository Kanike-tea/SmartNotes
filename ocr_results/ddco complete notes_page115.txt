e This information is informed to CPU by setting respective bits in the
status and controllerregister of DMA controller.
These are 2 types of request with respect to
system bus 1). CPU request.
2). DMA request.
Highest priority will be given to DMA request.

e Actually the CPU generates memory cycles to perform read and write
operations. The DMA controller steals memory cycles from the CPU to
perform read and write operations. This approach is called as “Cycle
stealing”.

e An exclusive option will be given for DMA controller to transfer block of data from
external devices to main memory and from main memory to external devices.
This technique is called as “Burst mode of operation.”

BUS ARBITRATION
e Any device which initiates data transfer operation on bus at any instant of
time is called as Bus- Master.
e When the bus mastership is transferred from one device to another device,
the next device isready to obtain the bus mastership.
e The bus-mastership is transferred from one device to another device based

on the principle ofpriority system. There are two types of bus-arbitration
technique:

«Centralized bus arbitration:

In this technique CPU acts as a bus-master or any control unit connected to bus
can be acts as a busmaster.

The schematic diagram of centralized bus arbitration is as shown in the fig.:
