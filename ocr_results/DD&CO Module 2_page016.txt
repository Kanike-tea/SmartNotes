Implementing a Boolean function with a multiplexer

2. Consider the implementation of the Boolean function F (A, B, C, D) == (1, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)

This function is implemented with a multiplexer with three selection inputs as shown in Fig below. Note
that the first variable A must be connected to selection input S2 so that A, B, and C correspond to
selection inputs S2, Si, and So respectively. The values for the data inputs are determined from the truth
table listed in the figure. The corresponding data line number is determined from the binary combination
of ABC. For example, the table shows that when ABC = 101, F = D, so the input variable D is applied
to data input 5.

Implementing a four-input function with a multiplexer

Three-State Gates

A multiplexer can be constructed with three-state gates—digital circuits that exhibit three states. Two of
the states are signals equivalent to logic | and logic 0 as in a conventional gate. The third state is a high-
impedance state in which (1) the logic behaves like an open circuit, which means that the output appears
to be disconnected, (2) the circuit has no logic significance, and (3) the circuit connected to the output
of the three-state gate is not affected by the inputs to the gate. Three-state gates may perform any
conventional logic, such as AND or NAND. However, the one most commonly used is the buffer gate.
The graphic symbol for a three-state buffer gate is shown in Fig below. It is distinguished from a normal
buffer by an input control line entering the bottom of the symbol. The buffer has a normal input, an
output, and a control input that determines the state of the output. When the control input is equal to 1,
the output is enabled and the gate behaves like a conventional buffer, with the output equal to the normal
