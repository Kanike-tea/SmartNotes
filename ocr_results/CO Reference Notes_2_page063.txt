ADDITION/SUBTRACTION LOGIC UNIT
¢ The n-bit adder can be used to add 2's complement numbers X and Y (Figure 9.3).
© Overflow can only occur when the signs of the 2 operands are the same.
. In order to perform the subtraction operation X-Y on 2's complement numbers X and Y; we
form the 2's complement of Y and add it to X.
¢ Addition or subtraction operation is done based on value applied to the Add/Sub input control-line.
. Control-line=0 for addition, applying the Y vector unchanged to one of the adder
inputs. Control-line=1 for subtraction, the Y vector is 2's complemented.
