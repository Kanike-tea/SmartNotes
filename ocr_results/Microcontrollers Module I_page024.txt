compared with an ARM7. The maximum core frequency attainable using an ARM9 is also

higher.

The ARM1O0 increases the pipeline length still further by adding a sixth stage, as shown in
Figure 7.

ARM1O0 can process on average 1.3 Dhrystone MIPS per MHz, about 34% more throughputs
than an ARM7 processor core, but again at a higher latency cost.

Even though the ARM9 and ARM1O pipelines are different, they still use the same pipeline
executing characteristics as an ARM7. Code written for the ARM7 will execute on an ARM9
or ARM1O.

Pipeline Executing Characteristics
The ARM pipeline has not processed an instruction until it passes completely through the
execute stage. For example, an ARM7 pipeline (with three stages) has executed an instruction
only when the fourth instruction is fetched.

Fig 8: ARM instruction sequence

Figure 8 shows an instruction sequence on an ARM7 pipeline. The MSR instruction is used

to enable IRQ interrupts, which only occurs once the MSR instruction completes the execute
stage of the pipeline. It clears the I bit in the cpsr to enable the IRQ interrupts. Once the ADD

instruction enters the execute stage of the pipeline, IRQ interrupts are enabled.
