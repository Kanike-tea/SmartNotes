is referred to as the Picard’s method of successive approximations which is carried
out till we reach the desired/specified degree of accuracy.

This method can be extended to simultaneous and higher order-differential equations.

WORKED PROBLEMS

1. Use the Picard's method to obtain the fourth approximation to the solution of
z =x+y, y(0) =1 and hence find y at x = 0.1,0.2.
>> By data, a =xt+y,y(0)=1
ie, dy=(xty)dx ; yelatx=0
Integtating LHS between 1 and y, RHS between 0 and x we have
