15.5.3 Nonadditive Join Decomposition into 4NF Relations

Whenever we decompose a relation schema R into R; = (X U Y) and R; = (R- Y)
based on an MVD X —» Y that holds in R, the decomposition has the nonadditive
join property. It can be shown that this is a necessary and sufficient condition for
decomposing a schema into two schemas that have the nonadditive join property,
as given by Property NJB’ that is a further generalization of Property NJB given
earlier in Section 14.5.1. Property NJB dealt with FDs only, whereas NJB’ deals with
both FDs and MVDs (recall that an FD is also an MVD).

Property NJB’. The relation schemas R; and R) form a nonadditive join
decomposition of R with respect to a set F of functional and multivalued depen-
dencies if and only if
(Ry 0 Ro) — (Ri = Ro)
or, by symmetry, if and only if
(Ry. Ro) > (Ro = Ri)
We can use a slight modification of Algorithm 15.5 to develop Algorithm 15.7,
which creates a nonadditive join decomposition into relation schemas that are in

ANF (rather than in BCNF). As with Algorithm 15.5, Algorithm 15.7 does not nec-
essarily produce a decomposition that preserves FDs.

Algorithm 15.7. Relational Decomposition into 4NF Relations with Nonad-
ditive Join Property
Input: A universal relation R and a set of functional and multivalued depen-
dencies F
1. Set D:={R};
2. While there is a relation schema Q in D that is not in 4NF, do
{ choose a relation schema Q in D that is not in 4NF;
find a nontrivial MVD X —» Y in Q that violates 4NF;
replace Q in D by two relation schemas (Q — Y) and (XU Y);
}s

15.6 Other Dependencies and Normal Forms

15.6.1 Join Dependencies and the Fifth Normal Form

We already introduced another type of dependency called join dependency (JD) in
Section 14.7. It arises when a relation is decomposable into a set of projected rela-
tions that can be joined back to yield the original relation. After defining JD, we
defined the fifth normal form based on it in Section 14.7. Fifth normal form has also
been known as project join normal form or PJNF (Fagin, 1979). A practical problem
with this and some additional dependencies (and related normal forms such as
DKNF, which is defined in Section 15.6.3) is that they are difficult to discover.
