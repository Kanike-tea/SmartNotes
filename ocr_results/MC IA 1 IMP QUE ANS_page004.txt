Current Program Status Register (CPSR) with Diagram

Figure 3 (not provided, but described) shows the basic layout of a generic Program Status Register
(PSR)49 . The ARM core uses the Current Program Status Register (cpsr) to monitor and control
internal operations49 . It is a 32-bit dedicated register located in the register file49 .

The cpsr is conceptually divided into four 8-bit fields: flags, status, extension, and control49 . In
current designs, the status and extension fields are typically reserved for future use49 .

Flags Field: Contains the condition flags (N, Z, C, V) that are updated by comparisons and ALU
operations (when the 'S' suffix is used on the instruction)50 .... Some cores might have extra flags like
the J bit for Jazelle-enabled processors50 .

Control Field: Contains the processor mode, state, and interrupt mask bits49 .

Processor Mode: Determines which registers are active and the access rights to the cpsr itself. There
are seven processor modes: six privileged (Abort, Fast Interrupt Request (FIQ), Interrupt Request
(IRQ), Supervisor (SVC), System, Undefined) and one non-privileged (User)50 .... Privileged modes
allow full read-write access to the cpsr, while non-privileged (User) mode only allows read access to
the control field and read-write access to condition flags50 .... The processor enters different modes
based on events like exceptions, interrupts, or after reset (Supervisor mode)13 .... System mode is a
special privileged version of User mode with full cpsr access54 .

State: Indicates the current instruction set being executed: ARM (32-bit), Thumb (16-bit), or Jazelle
(8-bit)14 .... The T bit in the cpsr reflects the Thumb state (T=1 for Thumb), and the J bit reflects the
Jazelle state. When both are 0, the processor is in ARM state56 . Specialized branch instructions are
used to change states56 .

Interrupt Mask: Contains bits to mask (disable) specific interrupt requests. The | bit (bit 7) masks
IRQ interrupts when set to 1, and the F bit (bit 6) masks FIQ interrupts when set to 151.

Memory & Cache Memory Band of Tightly Coupled Harvard Technology with Diagram

The memory in computer systems is organized in a hierarchy based on speed and cost57 . Faster
memory (like cache) is located closer to the ARM processor core and has smaller capacity, while
slower secondary memory is further away and has larger capacity57 ....
