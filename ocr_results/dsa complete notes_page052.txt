Data Structures and Applications(BCS304) Module 2

Nr

Example: Time sharing system: programs of higher priority are processed first and programs with the
same priority form a standard queue.

Representation using multiple queue: Use a separate queue for each level of priority. Each queue
will appear in its own circular array and must have its own pair of pointers, front and rear. If each
queue is allocated the same amount of space, a two dimensional array can be used instead of the linear
arrays.

Example : Consider the queue given below with the jobs and its priorities and its representation. A
job with priority 1 is considered to have the highest priority

DAA) A] NP elK

The queue is represented as a two dimensional array as shown below

Front | rear 1 )2 13 14 |5 |6

1 1 2 1) s1}s2
2 2 3 2 53

Delete operation

Algorithm:

1. Find the smallest k such that front[k]!=rear[k] ie Find the first non empty queue

2. Delete the process at the front of the queue
3. Exit

Insert operation
Algorithm: this algorithm adds an ITEM with priority number P to a priority queue maintained by a
two dimensional array

1. Inset ITEM as the rear element in row P-1 of queue

2. exit
