Reproduction can occur through various mechanisms, including sexual and asexual
reproduction.

g. Adaptation and Evolution:

Over generations, living organisms undergo adaptation and evolution.

Genetic material within cells can change through mutations and natural selection, leading to the
development of diverse species.

h. Ecological Interactions:

Organisms interact with their environment and with each other in complex ecosystems.

These interactions contribute to the balance of life and the sustainability of ecosystems.

2. What is cell? Explain Prokaryotic & Eukaryotic cells.
Ans. “A cell is defined as the smallest, basic unit of life that is responsible for all of life’s
processes.”
Cells are the structural, functional, and biological units of all living beings. A cell can replicate
itself independently. Hence, they are known as the building blocks of life. A cell is the structural
and fundamental unit of life. The study of cells from its basic structure to the functions of every

cell organelle is called Cell Biology. Robert Hooke was the first Biologist who discovered cells.
Types of Cells:

Cells are similar to factories with different labourers and departments that work towards a
common objective. Various types of cells perform different functions. Based on cellular

structure, there are two types of cells:

1. Prokaryotes

2. Eukaryotes
