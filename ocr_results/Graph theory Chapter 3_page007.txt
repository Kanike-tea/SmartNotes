Therefore, the total number of edges in T is Ni +N2 shaking

Rearranging terms, this gives

This is the required result.
Prove that every tree is a planar graph. “>

> Since a tree has no cycle in it, no subgraph of a tree has any cycles, Hence,.no, subgraph

of a tree can be isomorphic to Ks or K3,3 which are non-planar. Therefore, a tree cannot be
nonplanar. That is, every tree is a planar graph.
