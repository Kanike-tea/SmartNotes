The second algorithm is based on a direct implementation of the decrease-(by
one)-and-conquer technique: repeatedly, identify in a remaining digraph a source,
which is a vertex with no incoming edges, and delete it along with all the edges
outgoing from it. (If there are several sources, break the tie arbitrarily. If there
are none, stop because the problem cannot be solved—see Problem 6a in this
section’s exercises.) The order in which the vertices are deleted yields a solution
to the topological sorting problem. The application of this algorithm to the same
digraph representing the five courses is given in Figure 4.8.

Note that the solution obtained by the source-removal algorithm is different
from the one obtained by the DFS-based algorithm. Both of them are correct, of
course; the topological sorting problem may have several alternative solutions.

The tiny size of the example we used might create a wrong impression about
the topological sorting problem. But imagine a large project—e.g., in construction,
research, or software development—that involves a multitude of interrelated tasks
with known prerequisites. The first thing to do in such a situation is to make sure
that the set of given prerequisites is not contradictory. The convenient way of
doing this is to solve the topological sorting problem for the project’s digraph.
Only then can one start thinking about scheduling tasks to, say, minimize the total
completion time of the project. This would require, of course, other algorithms that
you can find in general books on operations research or in special ones on CPM.

methodologies.

As to applications of topological sorting in computer science, they include
instruction scheduling in program compilation, cell evaluation ordering in spread-
sheet formulas, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers.
