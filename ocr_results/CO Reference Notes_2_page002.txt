STEPS TO EXECUTE AN INSTRUCTION

1. The address of first instruction (to be executed) gets loaded into PC.

2. The contents of PC (i.e. address) are transferred to the MAR & control-unit issues Read signal to
memory.

3. After certain amount of elapsed time, the first instruction is read out of memory and placed into MDR.

4. Next, the contents of MDR are transferred to IR. At this point, the instruction can be decoded &
executed.

5. To fetch an operand, it's address is placed into MAR & control-unit issues Read signal. As a result, the

operand is transferred from memory into MDR, and then it is transferred from MDR to ALU.

Likewise required number of operands is fetched into processor.

Finally, ALU performs the desired operation.

If the result of this operation is to be stored in the memory, then the result is sent to the MDR.

a

The address of the location where the result is to be stored is sent to the MAR and a Write cycle is
initiated.

10. At some point during execution, contents of PC are incremented to point to next instruction in the

program.

BUS STRUCTURE
A bus is a group of lines that serves as a connecting path for several devices.A bus may be lines or wires.
The lines carry data or address or control signal.

There are 2 types of Bus structures: 1) Single Bus Structure and 2) Multiple Bus Structure.

1) Single Bus Structure
> Because the bus can be used for only one transfer at a time, only 2 units can actively use the

bus at any given time.
> Bus control lines are used to arbitrate multiple requests for use of the bus.
> Advantages:

Low cost & Flexibility for attaching peripheral devices.
