may be only available to the secure “state” through some new exported signals on the bus
interface. The system states are shown in Figure 15.5.

TrustZone is most useful in devices that will be carrying out content downloads such as
cell phones or other portable devices with network connections. Details of this architecture
are not public at the time of writing.

15.4.2) THUMB-2

Thumb-2 is an architectural extension designed to increase performance at high code
density. It allows for a blend of 32-bit ARM-like instructions with 16-bit Thumb instruc-
tions. This combination enables you to have the code density benefits of Thumb with the
additional performance benefits of access to 32-bit instructions.

Thumb-2 was announced in October 2003 and will be implemented in the
ARM1156T2-S processor. Details of this architecture are not public at the time of writing.
