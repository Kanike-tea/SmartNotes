11.2 Overview of Basic Features of PHP

discussion of PHP; there are many books that focus solely on PHP. Rather, we focus
on illustrating certain features of PHP that are particularly suited for creating
dynamic Web pages that contain database access commands. This section covers
some PHP concepts and features that will be needed when we discuss database
access in Section 11.3.

11.2.1 PHP Variables, Data Types, and Programming Constructs

PHP variable names start with the $ symbol and can include characters, letters, and
the underscore character (_). No other special characters are permitted. Variable
names are case sensitive, and the first character cannot be a number. Variables are
not typed. The values assigned to the variables determine their type. In fact, the
same variable can change its type once a new value is assigned to it. Assignment is
via the = operator.

Since PHP is directed toward text processing, there are several different types of
string values. There are also many functions available for processing strings. We
only discuss some basic properties of string values and variables here. Figure 11.2
illustrates some string values. There are three main ways to express strings and text:

1. Single-quoted strings. Enclose the string between single quotes, as in lines
0, 1, and 2. Ifa single quote is needed within the string, use the escape char-
acter (\) (see line 2).

2. Double-quoted strings. Enclose strings between double quotes as in
line 7. In this case, variable names appearing within the string are replaced
by the values that are currently stored in these variables. The interpreter
identifies variable names within double-quoted strings by their initial
character $ and replaces them with the value in the variable. This is known
as interpolating variables within strings. Interpolation does not occur in
single-quoted strings.

3. Here documents. Enclose a part of a document between a <<<DOCNAME
and end it with a single line containing the document name DOCNAME.

0) print ‘Welcome to my Web site.';

1) print 'I said to him, "Welcome Home"';

2) print 'We\'1l now visit the next Web site';

3) printf('The cost is $%.2f and the tax is $%.2f',
$cost, $tax) ;

4) print strtolower('AbCdE');

5) print ucwords(strtolower('JOHN smith'));

6) print ‘abc' . 'efg'

7) print "send your email reply to: $email_address"

8) print <<<FORM_HTML

9) <FORM method="post" action="$_SERVER[ 'PHP_SELF']">

10) Enter your name: <input type="text" name="user_name">

11) FORM_HTML
