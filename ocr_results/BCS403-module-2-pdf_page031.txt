2.5 Additional Relational Operations

2.5.1 Generalized Projection

The generalized projection operation extends the projection operation by allowing functions of
attributes to be included in the projection list. The generalized form can be expressed as:
TFA, F2, ..., Fn (R)
where F1, F2, ..., Fn are functions over the attributes in relation R and may involve arithmetic
operations and constant values.
The generalized projection helpful when developing reports where computed values have to be
produced in the columns of a query result. For example,consider the relation EMPLOYEE (Ssn,
Salary,Deduction, Years_service). A report may be required to show
Net Salary = Salary — Deduction,
Bonus = 2000 * Years_service, and
Tax = 0.25 * Salary.
generalized projection combined with renaming :
REPORT < p(5sn, Net salary, Bonus, Tax)(7Ssn, Salary— Deduction, 2000 *

Years_service, 0.25 * Salary(/EMPLOYEE)).

2.5.2 Aggregate Functions and Grouping

Aggregate functions are used in simple statistical queries that summarize information from the
database tuples.Common functions applied to collections of numeric values include
SUM,AVERAGE, MAXIMUM, and MINIMUM.The COUNT function is used for counting tuples
or values. For example, retrieving the average or total salary of all employees or the total number of

employee tuples.

Grouping the tuples in a relation by the value of some of their attributes and then applying an
aggregate function independently to each group. For example , group EMPLOYEE tuples by Dno, so
that each group includes the tuples for employees working in the same department. We can then list
each Dno value along with, say, the average salary of employees within the department, or the

number of employees who work in the department.
