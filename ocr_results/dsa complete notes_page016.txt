Limitation of binary search :
1. The list must be sorted
2. One must have a direct access to the middle element in any subset.

Polynomials: A polynomial is a sum of terms, where each term has a form ax°, where x is the variable,
a is the coefficient, and e is the exponent.

Example for polynomials :
A(X) = 3x70 +29 +4
B(x) = x4 + 10x3 + 3x2 + 1

The largest (or leading) exponent of a polynomial is called its degree. Coefficients that are zero are
not displayed.
e Standard mathematical definitions for the sum and product of polynomials are:
e Assume that we have two polynomials
A(x) = Yax' B(x) =Dpix'

then
A(x) + B(x) = Yq; + b)x'

A(x) B(x) = D(a; x" - Yb; x’)

Polynomial Representation:
e A polynomial can be represented as an array of structures as follows.

¢ Only one global array, terms, is used to store all the polynomials.
e The C declarations needed are:
