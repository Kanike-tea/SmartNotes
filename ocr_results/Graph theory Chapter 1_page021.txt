(2) Simple graph of order 5 and size 12.

(3) Complete graph of order 5 and size 10.

(4) Bipartite graph of order 4 and size 3.

(5) Bipartite graph of order 3 and size 4.

(6) Complete bipartite graph of order 4 and size 4.

Answers
1. (i) There are 6 vertices and 5 edges; therefore, the order is 6 and size is 5.
(ii) There are-5 vertices and 7 edges; therefore, the order is 5 and size is 7.
2. (i) {A,P}, (PB), {PC}, {C;Q)}, {C,R} are pairs of adjacent vertices,
Gi) {P,Q}, (PS), (0,5), {QR}, (Q,7), {R,T}, {S, T) are pairs of adjacent vertices,
