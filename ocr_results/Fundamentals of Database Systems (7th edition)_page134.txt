= Directors are also identified by name and date of birth and direct one or
more movies. It is possible for a director to act in a movie (including one
that he or she may also direct).

= Production companies are identified by name and each has an address. A
production company produces one or more movies.

Design an entity-relationship diagram for the movie database and enter the
design using a data modeling tool such as ERwin or Rational Rose.

Consider a CONFERENCE_REVIEW database in which researchers submit
their research papers for consideration. Reviews by reviewers are recorded
for use in the paper selection process. The database system caters primarily
to reviewers who record answers to evaluation questions for each paper they
review and make recommendations regarding whether to accept or reject
the paper. The data requirements are summarized as follows:

= Authors of papers are uniquely identified by e-mail id. First and last names

are also recorded.

= Each paper is assigned a unique identifier by the system and is described
bya title, abstract, and the name of the electronic file containing the paper.

= A paper may have multiple authors, but one of the authors is designated as
the contact author.

= Reviewers of papers are uniquely identified by e-mail address. Each re-
viewer's first name, last name, phone number, affiliation, and topics of in-
terest are also recorded.

= Each paper is assigned between two and four reviewers. A reviewer rates
each paper assigned to him or her on a scale of 1 to 10 in four categories:
technical merit, readability, originality, and relevance to the conference.
Finally, each reviewer provides an overall recommendation regarding
each paper.

= Each review contains two types of written comments: one to be seen by
the review committee only and the other as feedback to the author(s).

Design an entity-relationship diagram for the CONFERENCE_REVIEW data-
base and build the design using a data modeling tool such as ERwin or
Rational Rose.

Consider the ER diagram for the AIRLINE database shown in Figure 3.21.
Build this design using a data modeling tool such as ERwin or Rational Rose.

Selected Bibliography

The entity-relationship model was introduced by Chen (1976), and related work
appears in Schmidt and Swenson (1975), Wiederhold and Elmasri (1979), and
Senko (1975). Since then, numerous modifications to the ER model have been
suggested. We have incorporated some of these in our presentation. Structural
