572 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

Table A.2 ARM condition mnemonics.

<cond> Instruction is executed when cpsr condition
{|AL} ALways

EQ EQual (last result zero)

NE Not Equal (last result nonzero)

{CS|HS} Carry Set, unsigned Higher or Same (following a compare)
{CC|LO} Carry Clear, unsigned LOwer (following a comparison)

MI Minus (last result negative)

PL PLus (last result greater than or equal to zero)

VS V flag Set (signed overflow on last result)

ve V flag Clear (no signed overflow on last result)

HI unsigned HIgher (following a comparison)

LS unsigned Lower or Same (following a comparison)
GE signed Greater than or Equal

LT signed Less Than

GT signed Greater Than

LE signed Less than or Equal

NV NeVer—ARMvI1 and ARMv2 only—DO NOT USE

m= <NoUnsignedOverf]ow> is the same as 1 — <UnsignedOverflow>.
=) <Zero> is a flag indicating that the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is zero.
The Z flag in the cpsr typically records the zero condition.

= <Negative> is a flag indicating that the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is
negative. In other words, <Negative> is bit 31 of the result. The N flag in the cpsr
typically records this condition.

A.2.5. SHIFT OPERATIONS

= <imm_shift> represents a shift by an immediate specified amount. The possible shifts
are LSL #<0-31>, LSR #<1-32>, ASR #<1-32>, ROR #<1-31>, and RRX. See Table A.3
for the actions of each shift.

= <reg_shift> represents a shift by a register-specified amount. The possible shifts are
LSL Rs, LSR Rs, ASR Rs, and ROR Rs. Rs must not be pc. The bottom eight bits of Rs
are used as the shift value k in Table A.3. Bits Rs[31:8] are ignored.

= <shift> is shorthand for <imm_shift> or<reg_shift>.

=) <shifted_Rm>is shorthand for the value of Rmatfter the specified shift has been applied.
See Table A.3.
