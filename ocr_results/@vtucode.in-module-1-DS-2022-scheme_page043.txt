Precedence of the operators
The first problem with understanding the meaning of expressions and statements is

finding out the order in which the operations are performed.
Example: assume that a =4, b =c =2, d =e =3 in below expression

X=a/b-c+d*e-a*c

((4/2)-2) + (3*3)-(4#2) (A/ (2-2 +3) *(3-4)*2
=049-8 OR = (4/3) * (-1) * 2
=I = -2.66666

The first answer is picked most because division is carried out before subtraction, and
multiplication before addition. If we wanted the second answer, write expression
differently using parentheses to change the order of evaluation

X= ((a/(b-c+d))*(e-a)*e
In C, there is a precedence hierarchy that determines.the order in which operators are

evaluated. Below figure contains the precedence hierarchy for C.
