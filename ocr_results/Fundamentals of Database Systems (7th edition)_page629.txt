Selected Bibliography

a complete discussion of hash functions and collision resolution techniques, as well
as of their performance comparison. Knuth also offers a detailed discussion of tech-
niques for sorting external files. Textbooks on file structures include Claybrook
(1992), Smith and Barnes (1987), and Salzberg (1988); they discuss additional file
organizations including tree-structured files, and have detailed algorithms for
operations on files. Salzberg et al. (1990) describe a distributed external sorting
algorithm. File organizations with a high degree of fault tolerance are described by
Bitton and Gray (1988) and by Gray et al. (1990). Disk striping was proposed in
Salem and Garcia Molina (1986). The first paper on redundant arrays of inexpen-
sive disks (RAID) is by Patterson et al. (1988). Chen and Patterson (1990) and the
excellent survey of RAID by Chen et al. (1994) are additional references. Gro-
chowski and Hoyt (1996) discuss future trends in disk drives. Various formulas for
the RAID architecture appear in Chen et al. (1994).

Morris (1968) is an early paper on hashing. Extendible hashing is described in Fagin
et al. (1979). Linear hashing is described by Litwin (1980). Algorithms for insertion
and deletion for linear hashing are discussed with illustrations in Salzberg (1988).
Dynamic hashing, which we briefly introduced, was proposed by Larson (1978).
There are many proposed variations for extendible and linear hashing; for examples,
see Cesarini and Soda (1991), Du and Tong (1991), and Hachem and Berra (1992).

Gibson et al. (1997) describe a file server scaling approach for network-attached
storage, and Kubiatowicz et al. (2000) decribe the Oceanstore system for creating a
global utility infrastructure for storing persistent data. Both are considered pio-
neering approaches that led to the ideas for object-based storage. Mesnier et al.
(2003) give an overview of the object storage concept. The Lustre system (Braam &
Schwan, 2002) was one of the first object storage products and is used in the major-
ity of supercomputers, including the top two, namely China’s Tianhe-2 and
Oakridge National Lab’s Titan.
