Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

database management system. Of course, we are only concerned with computer-
ized databases in this text.

A database management system (DBMS) is a computerized system that enables
users to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose software
system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and
sharing databases among various users and applications. Defining a database
involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be
stored in the database. The database definition or descriptive information is also
stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called
meta-data. Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some
storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. Manipulating a database includes
functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the data-
base to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data.
Sharing a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database
simultaneously.

An application program accesses the database by sending queries or requests for
data to the DBMS. A query” typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction
may cause some data to be read and some data to be written into the database.

Other important functions provided by the DBMS include protecting the database
and maintaining it over a long period of time. Protection includes system protec-
tion against hardware or software malfunction (or crashes) and security protection
against unauthorized or malicious access. A typical large database may have a life
cycle of many years, so the DBMS must be able to maintain the database system by
allowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time.

It is not absolutely necessary to use general-purpose DBMS software to implement
a computerized database. It is possible to write a customized set of programs to cre-
ate and maintain the database, in effect creating a special-purpose DBMS software
for a specific application, such as airlines reservations. In either case—whether we
use a general-purpose DBMS or not—a considerable amount of complex software
is deployed. In fact, most DBMSs are very complex software systems.

To complete our initial definitions, we will call the database and DBMS software
together a database system. Figure 1.1 illustrates some of the concepts we have
discussed so far.

1.2 An Example

Let us consider a simple example that most readers may be familiar with: a
UNIVERSITY database for maintaining information concerning students, courses,
and grades in a university environment. Figure 1.2 shows the database structure
and a few sample data records. The database is organized as five files, each of which

The term query, originally meaning a question or an inquiry, is sometimes loosely used for all types of
interactions with databases, including modifying the data.
