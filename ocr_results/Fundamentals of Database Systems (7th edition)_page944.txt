Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop

25.1 What Is Big Data?

Big data is becoming a popular and even a fashionable term. People use this term
whenever a large amount of data is involved with some analysis; they think that
using this term will make the analysis look like an advanced application. However,
the term big data legitimately refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of
typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze. In today’s
environment, the size of datasets that may be considered as big data ranges from
terabytes (10*+12 bytes), or petabytes (10**15 bytes), to exabytes (10**18 bytes).
The notion of what is Big data will depend on the industry, how data is used, how
much historical data is involved and many other characteristics. The Gartner
Group, a popular enterprise-level organization that industry looks up to for learn-
ing about trends, characterized big data in 2011 by the three V’s: volume, velocity,
and variety. Other characteristics, such as veracity and value, have been added to
the definition by other researchers. Let us briefly see what these stand for.

Volume. The volume of data obviously refers to the size of data managed by the
system. Data that is somewhat automatically generated tends to be voluminous.
Examples include sensor data, such as the data in manufacturing or processing
plants generated by sensors; data from scanning equipment, such as smart card and
credit card readers; and data from measurement devices, such as smart meters or
environmental recording devices.

The industrial internet of things (IIOT or IOT) is expected to bring about a revo-
lution that will improve the operational efficiency of enterprises and open up new
frontiers for harnessing intelligent technologies. The IOT will cause billions of
devices to be connected to the Internet because these devices generate data continu-
ously. For example, in gene sequencing, next generation sequencing (NGS) tech-
nology means that the volume of gene sequence data will be increased exponentially.

Many additional applications are being developed and are slowly becoming a real-
ity. These applications include using remote sensing to detect underground sources
of energy, environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring and regulation by auto-
matic sensors mounted on vehicles and roads, remote monitoring of patients using
special scanners and equipment, and tighter control and replenishment of invento-
ries using radio-frequency identification (RFID) and other technologies. All these
developments will have associated with them a large volume of data. Social net-
works such as Twitter and Facebook have hundreds of millions of subscribers
worldwide who generate new data with every message they send or post they make.
Twitter hit a half billion tweets daily in October 2012.° The amount of data required
to store one second of high-definition video may equal 2,000 pages of text data.
Thus, the multimedia data being uploaded on YouTube and similar video hosting
platforms is significantly more voluminous than simple numeric or text data. In
2010, enterprises stored over 13 exabytes (10+*18 bytes) of data, which amounts to
over 50,000 times the amount of data stored by the Library of Congress.°
