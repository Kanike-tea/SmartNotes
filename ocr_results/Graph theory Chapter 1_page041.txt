> We observe that the first graph has 4 vertices and 6 edges and the second graph has 4 vertices
and 7 edges. As such, one-to-one correspondence between the edges is not possible. Hence the
two graphs are not isomorphic. 1

> We note that each of the two graphs has 6 vertices and 9 edges. But, the first graph has?
vertices of degree 4 whereas the second graph has 3 vertices of degree 4. Therefore, there Ca
not be any one-to-one correspondence between the vertices and between the edges of the oa
graphs which preserves the adjacency of vertices. As such, the two graphs are not isomorphi
