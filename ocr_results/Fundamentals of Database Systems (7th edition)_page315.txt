. Specify queries c, d, and f of Exercise 8.18 in both tuple and domain rela-
tional calculus.

Ina tuple relational calculus query with n tuple variables, what would be the
typical minimum number of join conditions? Why? What is the effect of
having a smaller number of join conditions?

Rewrite the domain relational calculus queries that followed Qo in Sec-
tion 8.7 in the style of the abbreviated notation of QOA, where the objective
is to minimize the number of domain variables by writing constants in place
of variables wherever possible.

- Consider this query: Retrieve the Ssns of employees who work on at least
those projects on which the employee with Ssn=123456789 works. This may
be stated as (FORALL x) (IF P THEN Q), where

= xisa tuple variable that ranges over the PROJECT relation.
= P=employee with Ssn=123456789 works on project x.
™ Q=employee e works on project x.
Express the query in tuple relational calculus, using the rules
= (V x)(P(x)) =NOT(Ax)(NOT(P(x))).
= (IF PTHEN Q) = (NOT(P) OR Q).
. Show how you can specify the following relational algebra operations in
both tuple and domain relational calculus.
a. O4=c(R(A, B, C))
b. Ta, p>(R(A, B, C))
c. R(A, B, C) * S(C, D, E)
. R(A, B, C) U S(A, B, C)
. R(A, B, C) 0 S(A, B, C)
f. R(A, B,C) = S(A, B,C)
g. R(A, B, C) x S(D, E, F)
h. R(A, B) + S(A)
Suggest extensions to the relational calculus so that it may express the fol-
lowing types of operations that were discussed in Section 8.4: (a) aggre-

gate functions and grouping; (b) OUTER JOIN operations; (c) recursive
closure queries.

A nested query is a query within a query. More specifically, a nested query is
a parenthesized query whose result can be used as a value in a number of
places, such as instead of a relation. Specify the following queries on the
database specified in Figure 5.5 using the concept of nested queries and the
relational operators discussed in this chapter. Also show the result of each
query as it would apply to the database state in Figure 5.6.

a. List the names of all employees who work in the department that has the
employee with the highest salary among all employees.
