DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

e The left parenthesis complicates matters because it behaves like a low-precedence
operator when it is on the stack and a high-precedence one when it is not. It is
placed in the stack whenever it is found in the expression, but it is unstacked only
when its matching right parenthesis is found.

e There are two types of precedence, in-stack precedence (isp) and incoming

precedence (icp).

The declarations that establish the precedence’s are:

/* isp and icp arrays-index is value of precedence Iparen rparen, plus, minus, times,
divide, mod, eos */

int isp[] = {0,19,12,12,13,13,13,0};

int icp[] = {20,19,12,12,13,13,13,0};

token;
int n = 0,top = 0; /* place eos on
stack */ stack[0] = eos;
for (token = getToken(&symbol, &n); token != eos; token =
getToken(&symbol,& n ))
{

if (token == operand)
