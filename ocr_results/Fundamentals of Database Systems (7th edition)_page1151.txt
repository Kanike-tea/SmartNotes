Database Security

Th chapter discusses techniques for securing data-
ases against a variety of threats. It also presents
schemes of providing access privileges to authorized users. Some of the security
threats to databases—such as SQL injection—will be presented. At the end of the
chapter, we summarize how a mainstream RDBMS—specifically, the Oracle sys-
tem—provides different types of security. We start in Section 30.1 with an intro-
duction to security issues and the threats to databases, and we give an overview of
the control measures that are covered in the rest of this chapter. We also comment
on the relationship between data security and privacy as it applies to personal infor-
mation. Section 30.2 discusses the mechanisms used to grant and revoke privileges
in relational database systems and in SQL, mechanisms that are often referred to as
discretionary access control. In Section 30.3, we present an overview of the mecha-
nisms for enforcing multiple levels of security—a particular concern in database
system security that is known as mandatory access control. Section 30.3 also intro-
duces the more recently developed strategies of role-based access control, and
label-based and row-based security. Section 30.3 also provides a brief discussion of
XML access control. Section 30.4 discusses a major threat to databases—SQL injec-
tion—and discusses some of the proposed preventive measures against it. Sec-
tion 30.5 briefly discusses the security problem in statistical databases. Section 30.6
introduces the topic of flow control and mentions problems associated with covert
channels. Section 30.7 provides a brief summary of encryption and symmetric key
and asymmetric (public) key infrastructure schemes. It also discusses digital certifi-
cates. Section 30.8 introduces privacy-preserving techniques, and Section 30.9 pres-
ents the current challenges to database security. In Section 30.10, we discuss Oracle
label-based security. Finally, Section 30.11 summarizes the chapter. Readers who
are interested only in basic database security mechanisms will find it sufficient to
cover the material in Sections 30.1 and 30.2.
