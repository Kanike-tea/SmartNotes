Logic synthesis is the process of deriving a list of physical components and their interconnections (called

a netlist) from the model of a digital system described in an HDL.

Timing verification confirms that the fabricated, integrated circuit will operate at a specified speed.
Because each logic gate in a circuit has a propagation delay, a signal transition at the input of a circuit

cannot immediately cause a change in the logic value of the output of a circuit.

Verilog model is composed of text using keywords, of which there are about 100. Keywords are
predefined lowercase identifiers that define the language constructs. Examples of keywords are module,
endmodule, input, output, wire, and, or, and not. For clarity, keywords will be displayed in boldface in
the text in all examples of code and wherever it is appropriate to call attention to their use. Any text
between two forward slashes ( // ) and the end of the line is interpreted as a comment and will have no
effect on a simulation using the model. Multiline comments begin with / * and terminate with * /. Blank
spaces are ignored, but they may not appear within the text of a key Iword, a user-specified identifier,
an operator, or the representation of a number. Verilog is case sensitive, which means that uppercase
and lowercase letters are distinguishable (e.g., not is not the same as NOT). The term module refers to
the text enclosed by the keyword pair module . . . endmodule. A module is the fundamental descriptive

unit in the Verilog language. It is declared by the keyword module and must always be terminated by

the keyword endmodule.
