R is the name of a relation and Al, A2,...An is a list of attributes representing R then
R(A1,A2,...,An) is called a Relational Schema. Each attribute in this relational schema takes a
value from some specific domain called domain(Ai).

Example:

PERSON (PERSON_ID:INTEGER, NAME:STRING, AGE:INTEGER, ADDRESS:STRING)

Total number of attributes in a relation denotes the degree of a relation since the PERSON relation
scheme contains four attributes, so this relation is of degree 4.

Relation Instance:
A relational instance denoted as r is a collection of tuples for a given relational schema at a specific
point of time.
Arelation state r to the relations schema R(A1, A2..., An) also denoted by r(R) is a set of n-tuples
R{tl,t2,...tm}
Where each n-tuple is an ordered list of n values
T=<vl,v2,....vn>
Where each vi belongs to domain (Ai) or contains null values.
The relation schema is also called ‘intension’ and the relation state is also called ‘extension’.
Eg: Relation schema for Student
STUDENT(rollno:string, name:string, city:string, age:integer)

Relation instance:

Student:
Rollno Name City Age
101 Sujit Bam 23
102 kunal bbsr 22
Keys:
Super key:
A super key is an attribute or a set of attributes used to identify the records uniquely in a relation.

For example, customer-id, (cname, customer-id), (cname,telno)

Candidate key:

Super keys of a relation can contain extra attributes. Candidate keys are minimal super keys. i.e,
such a key contains no extraneous attribute. An attribute is called extraneous if even after removing
it from the key, makes the remaining attributes still has the properties of a key(atribute represents
entire table).

In a relation R, a candidate key for R is a subset of the set of attributes of R, which have the
following properties

e Uniqueness: no two distinct tuples in R have the same values for
the candidate key
e  Irreducible: No proper subset of the candidate key has the

uniqueness property that is the candidate key.
e Acandidate key’s values must exist. It cant be null.
e The values of a candidate key must be stable. Its value can not change outside the
