DBMS must make sure that the new value refers to an existing tuple in the refer-
enced relation (or is set to NULL). Similar options exist to deal with referential integ-
rity violations caused by Update as those options discussed for the Delete operation.
In fact, when a referential integrity constraint is specified in the DDL, the DBMS will
allow the user to choose separate options to deal with a violation caused by Delete
and a violation caused by Update (see Section 6.2).

5.3.4 The Transaction Concept

A database application program running against a relational database typically exe-
cutes one or more transactions. A transaction is an executing program that includes
some database operations, such as reading from the database, or applying inser-
tions, deletions, or updates to the database. At the end of the transaction, it must
leave the database in a valid or consistent state that satisfies all the constraints spec-
ified on the database schema. A single transaction may involve any number of
retrieval operations (to be discussed as part of relational algebra and calculus in
Chapter 8, and as a part of the language SQL in Chapters 6 and 7) and any number
of update operations. These retrievals and updates will together form an atomic
unit of work against the database. For example, a transaction to apply a bank with-
drawal will typically read the user account record, check if there is a sufficient bal-
ance, and then update the record by the withdrawal amount.

A large number of commercial applications running against relational databases in
online transaction processing (OLTP) systems are executing transactions at rates
that reach several hundred per second. Transaction processing concepts, concur-
rent execution of transactions, and recovery from failures will be discussed in
Chapters 20 to 22.

5.4 Summary

In this chapter we presented the modeling concepts, data structures, and constraints
provided by the relational model of data. We started by introducing the concepts of
domains, attributes, and tuples. Then, we defined a relation schema as a list of attri-
butes that describe the structure of a relation. A relation, or relation state, is a set of
tuples that conforms to the schema.

Several characteristics differentiate relations from ordinary tables or files. The first
is that a relation is not sensitive to the ordering of tuples. The second involves the
ordering of attributes in a relation schema and the corresponding ordering of val-
ues within a tuple. We gave an alternative definition of relation that does not require
ordering of attributes, but we continued to use the first definition, which requires
attributes and tuple values to be ordered, for convenience. Then, we discussed val-
ues in tuples and introduced NULL values to represent missing or unknown infor-
mation. We emphasized that NULL values should be avoided as much as possible.

We classified database constraints into inherent model-based constraints, explicit
schema-based constraints, and semantic constraints or business rules. Then, we
