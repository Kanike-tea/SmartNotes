26.3 Spatial Database Concepts

where the topography of a geographical location can be represented with an x, y, z
data model known as Digital Terrain (or Elevation) Model (DTM/DEM). The x and
y dimensions of a DTM represent the horizontal plane, and z represents spot
heights for the respective x, y coordinates. Such models can be used for analysis of
environmental data or during the design of engineering projects that require ter-
rain information. Spatial search allows a user to search for objects within a particu-
lar spatial region. For example, thematic search allows us to search for objects
related to a particular theme or class, such as “Find all water bodies within 25 miles
of Atlanta” where the class is water.

There are also topological relationships among spatial objects. These are often
used in Boolean predicates to select objects based on their spatial relationships. For
example, if a city boundary is represented as a polygon and freeways are repre-
sented as multilines, a condition such as “Find all freeways that go through Arling-
ton, Texas” would involve an intersects operation, to determine which freeways
(lines) intersect the city boundary (polygon).

26.3.2 Spatial Data Types and Models

This section briefly describes the common data types and models for storing spatial
data. Spatial data comes in three basic forms. These forms have become a de facto
standard due to their wide use in commercial systems.

= Map data” includes various geographic or spatial features of objects in a
map, such as an object’s shape and the location of the object within the map.
The three basic types of features are points, lines, and polygons (or areas).
Points are used to represent spatial characteristics of objects whose loca-
tions correspond to a single 2-D coordinate (x, y, or longitude/latitude) in
the scale of a particular application. Depending on the scale, some examples
of point objects could be buildings, cellular towers, or stationary vehicles.
Moving vehicles and other moving objects can be represented by a sequence
of point locations that change over time. Lines represent objects having
length, such as roads or rivers, whose spatial characteristics can be approxi-
mated by a sequence of connected lines. Polygons are used to represent spa-
tial characteristics of objects that have a boundary, such as countries, states,
lakes, or cities. Notice that some objects, such as buildings or cities, can be
represented as either points or polygons, depending on the scale of detail.

= Attribute data is the descriptive data that GIS systems associate with map
features. For example, suppose that a map contains features that represent
counties within a U.S. state (such as Texas or Oregon). Attributes for each
county feature (object) could include population, largest city/town, area in
square miles, and so on. Other attribute data could be included for other
features in the map, such as states, cities, congressional districts, census
tracts, and so on.

These types of geographic data are based on ESRI's guide to GIS. See wwwgis.com/implementing_gis/
