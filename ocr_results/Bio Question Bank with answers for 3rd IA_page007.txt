(annealed) so that the staples can correctly bind to the scaffold strand and form the
desired structure.

5. Structure Formation: As the temperature drops, the staple strands hybridize with their
complementary parts on the scaffold strand, folding the DNA into the pre-designed
shape through self-assembly.

6. Purification and Analysis: The completed DNA origami structures are purified and
examined using techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) or transmission

electron microscopy (TEM) to verify that the correct shape has formed.

DNA origami has many applications in nanotechnology, biomedicine, and drug delivery. For
example, researchers are exploring DNA origami to create nanoscale drug carriers that can
open in response to specific signals inside the human body, releasing medicine directly at the
target site. It is also being used to build nanorobots, biosensors, and frameworks for studying

molecular interactions.

6. Give an account on the process involved in the self-healing bio concrete.

Ans. Self-healing bio-concrete is a type of concrete that incorporates microorganisms, such
as Bacillus fragments, into the mixture, along with calcium lactate as a nutrient source. The
microorganisms are activated when the concrete cracks, and they produce calcium carbonate,
which fills in the cracks and repairs the concrete. This process is known as bio-

mineralization.

The benefits of self-healing bio-concrete include increased durability, reduced maintenance
costs, and improved sustainability, as the concrete is able to repair itself without the need for
human intervention. Additionally, because the microorganisms used in the concrete are
naturally occurring and non-toxic, self-healing bio-concrete is considered to be

environmentally friendly.

Self-healing bio-concrete is still a relatively new technology and is currently in the research
and development phase. However, initial studies have shown promising results and have
demonstrated the potential for self-healing bio-concrete to be a viable alternative to

traditional concrete in certain applications.
