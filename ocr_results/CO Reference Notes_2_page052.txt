Figure 8.17 —Associative-mapped cache.

* It gives complete freedom in choosing the cache-location.

« A new block that has to be brought into the cache has to replace an existing block if the cache is full.
« The memory has to determine whether a given block is in the cache.

« Advantage: It is more flexible than direct mapping technique.

* Disadvantage: Its cost is high.

¢ It is the combination of direct and associative mapping. (Figure 8.18).
© The blocks of the cache are grouped into sets.
© The mapping allows a block of the main-memory to reside in any block of the specified set.
© The cache has 2 blocks per set, so the memory-blocks 0, 64, 128........ 4032 maps into cache set ,,0°.
© The cache can occupy either of the two block position within the set.
6 bit set field
> Determines which set of cache contains the desired block.
6 bit tag field
> The tag field of the address is compared to the tags of the two blocks of the set.
> This comparison is done to check if the desired block is present.
