Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

In this chapter we present the terminology and basic concepts that will be used
throughout the text. Section 2.1 discusses data models and defines the concepts
of schemas and instances, which are fundamental to the study of database sys-
tems. We discuss the three-schema DBMS architecture and data independence
in Section 2.2; this provides a user’s perspective on what a DBMS is supposed to
do. In Section 2.3 we describe the types of interfaces and languages that are typi-
cally provided by a DBMS. Section 2.4 discusses the database system software
environment. Section 2.5 gives an overview of various types of client/server
architectures. Finally, Section 2.6 presents a classification of the types of DBMS
packages. Section 2.7 summarizes the chapter.

The material in Sections 2.4 through 2.6 provides detailed concepts that may be
considered as supplementary to the basic introductory material.

2.1 Data Models, Schemas, and Instances

One fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that it provides some
level of data abstraction. Data abstraction generally refers to the suppression of
details of data organization and storage, and the highlighting of the essential fea-
tures for an improved understanding of data. One of the main characteristics of the
database approach is to support data abstraction so that different users can perceive
data at their preferred level of detail. A data model—a collection of concepts that
can be used to describe the structure of a database—provides the necessary means
to achieve this abstraction.” By structure of a database we mean the data types, rela-
tionships, and constraints that apply to the data. Most data models also include a
set of basic operations for specifying retrievals and updates on the database.

In addition to the basic operations provided by the data model, it is becoming more
common to include concepts in the data model to specify the dynamic aspect or
behavior of a database application. This allows the database designer to specify a set
of valid user-defined operations that are allowed on the database objects.> An
example of a user-defined operation could be COMPUTE_GPA, which can be
applied to a STUDENT object. On the other hand, generic operations to insert,
delete, modify, or retrieve any kind of object are often included in the basic data
model operations. Concepts to specify behavior are fundamental to object-oriented
data models (see Chapter 12) but are also being incorporated in more traditional
data models. For example, object-relational models (see Chapter 12) extend the basic
relational model to include such concepts, among others. In the basic relational data
model, there is a provision to attach behavior to the relations in the form of persis-
tent stored modules, popularly known as stored procedures (see Chapter 10).

2Sometimes the word model is used to denote a specific database description, or schema—for example,
the marketing data model. We will not use this interpretation.

3The inclusion of concepts to describe behavior reflects a trend whereby database design and software
design activities are increasingly being combined into a single activity. Traditionally, specifying behavior is
associated with software design.
