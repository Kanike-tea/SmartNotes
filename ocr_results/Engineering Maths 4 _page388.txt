Remark: IfN is very large, then C is closer to 1 as we have It ae

- In practice if N is large the correction factor can be omitted.

Illustrative Example

Let { 12298 } constitute a population. We form the sampling distribution of the
sample means in the case of (1) random samples of size 2 with replacement (2) random
samples of size 2 without replacement.

>> Here N (size of the finite population) = 3

14+2+3

Population mean ([1) = 3°72

Population variance (62) = ; { (1-2? +(2-2)+(3-2)} =

~ Case- (i) Random samples of size 2 (n = 2) with replacement
" The various possible samples are :
(1,1) (1, 2) (1, 3) ; (2, 1), (2, 2), (2,3) + (3,1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
These are N" = 3? = 9 inmumber.
The mean of these are respectively
1,15,2,15, 2,25, 2, 25,3

We prepare the frequency distribution of these means where x is the variate and f is
the frequency. ,
