27.4 Text Preprocessing

for wildcard searches in Web search engines involves preprocessing overhead and is
not generally implemented by many Web search engines today.!” Retrieval models do
not directly provide support for this query type. Lucene’® provides support for certain
types of wildcard queries. The query parser in Lucene computes a large Boolean query
combining all combinations and expansions of words from the index.

27.3.6 Natural Language Queries

There are a few natural language search engines that aim to understand the structure
and meaning of queries written in natural language text, generally as a question or nar-
rative. This is an active area of research that employs techniques like shallow semantic
parsing of text, or query reformulations based on natural language understanding. The
system tries to formulate answers for such queries from retrieved results. Some search
systems are starting to provide natural language interfaces to provide answers to spe-
cific types of questions, such as definition and factoid questions, which ask for defini-
tions of technical terms or common facts that can be retrieved from specialized
databases. Such questions are usually easier to answer because there are strong linguis-
tic patterns giving clues to specific types of sentences—for example, ‘defined as’ or
‘refers to’. Semantic models can provide support for this query type.

27.4 Text Preprocessing

In this section, we review the commonly used text preprocessing techniques that
are part of the text processing task in Figure 27.1.

27.4.1 Stopword Removal

Stopwords are very commonly used words in a language that play a major role in the
formation of a sentence but that seldom contribute to the meaning of that sentence.
Words that are expected to occur in 80% or more of the documents in a collection
are typically referred to as stopwords, and they are rendered potentially useless.
Because of the commonness and function of these words, they do not contribute
much to the relevance of a document for a query search. Examples include words
such as the, of, to, a, and, in, said, for, that, was, on, he, is, with, at, by, and it. These
words are presented here with decreasing frequency of occurrence from a large cor-
pus of documents called AP89.!° The fist six of these words account for 20% of all
words in the listing, and the most frequent 50 words account for 40% of all text.

Removal of stopwords from a document must be performed before indexing. Arti-
cles, prepositions, conjunctions, and some pronouns are generally classified as stop-
words. Queries must also be preprocessed for stopword removal before the actual
retrieval process. Removal of stopwords results in elimination of possible spurious
