HDL Example below shows the gate-level description of a Four-bit ripple carry adder

There are two basic types of design methodologies: top down and bottom up. In a top-down design, the
top-level block is defined and then the subblocks necessary to build the top-level block are identified. In
a bottom-up design, the building blocks are first identified and then combined to build the top-level
block. Take, for example, the binary adder shown in below fig. It can be considered as a top-block
component built with four full-adder blocks, while each full adder is built with two half-adder blocks.
In a top-down design, the four-bit adder is defined first, and then the two adders are described. In a
bottom-up design, the half adder is defined, then each full adder is constructed, and then the four-bit
adder is built from the full adders.

Four-bit adder

A bottom-up hierarchical description of a four-bit adder is shown in HDL Example below. The half
adder is defined by instantiating primitive gates. The next module describes the full adder by
instantiating and connecting two half adders. The third module describes the four-bit adder by
instantiating and connecting four full adders. Note that the first character of an identifier cannot be a
number, but can be an underscore, so the module name _4bitadder is valid. An alternative name that is
meaningful, but does not require a leading underscore, is adder_4_bit. The instantiation is done by using
the name of the module that is instantiated together with a new (or the same) set of port names. For
example, the half adder HA1 inside the full adder module is instantiated with ports S1, Cl, x, and y.
This produces a half adder with outputs S1 and C1 and inputs x and y.
