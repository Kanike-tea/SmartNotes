and two links are used.

DBTG Sets:
o The structure consisting of two record types that are linked together is referred to in the
DBTG model as a DBTG set
o Ineach DBTG set, one record type is designated as the owner, and the other is designated as
the member, of the set.
o Each DBTG set can have any number of set occurrences (actual instances of linked records).
o Since many-to-many links are disallowed, each set occurrence has precisely one owner, and
has zero or more member records.
o No member record of a set can participate in more than one occurrence of the set at any
point.
o A member record can participate simultaneously in several set occurrences of different

DBTG sets.
