The memory in all computer systems has to be arranged in some form of hierarchy. Figure 2
shows a device that supports external off-chip memory. Internal to the processor there is an

option of a cache to improve memory performance.

Figure 3 shows the memory trade-offs: the fastest memory cache is physically located nearer
the ARM processor core and the slowest secondary memory is set further away. Generally

the closer memory is to the processor core, the more it costs and the smaller its capacity.

The cache is placed between main memory and the core. It is used to speed up data transfer
between the processor and main memory. A cache provides an overall increase in
performance but with a loss of predictable execution time. Although the cache increases the

general performance of the system, it does not help real-time system response.

The main memory is large around 256 KB to 256 MB (or even greater), depending on the
application and is generally stored in separate chips. Load and store instructions access the
main memory unless the values have been stored in the cache for fast access. Secondary
storage is the largest and slowest form of memory. Hard disk drives and CD-ROM drives are

examples of secondary storage.

Width

The memory width is the number of bits the memory returns on each access typically 8, 16,
32, or 64 bits. The memory width has a direct effect on the overall performance and cost
ratio.

If an uncached system uses 32-bitARMinstructions and 16-bit-wide memory chips, then the

processor will have to make two memory fetches per instruction. Each fetch requires two 16-
