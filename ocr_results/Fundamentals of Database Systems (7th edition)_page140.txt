Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

as a member of any number of subclasses. For example, a salaried employee who is
also an engineer belongs to the two subclasses ENGINEER and SALARIED_EMPLOYEE
of the EMPLOYEE entity type. However, it is not necessary that every entity in a
superclass is a member of some subclass.

An important concept associated with subclasses (subtypes) is that of type
inheritance. Recall that the type of an entity is defined by the attributes it possesses
and the relationship types in which it participates. Because an entity in the subclass
represents the same real-world entity from the superclass, it should possess values
for its specific attributes as well as values of its attributes as a member of the super-
class. We say that an entity that is a member of a subclass inherits all the attributes of
the entity as a member of the superclass. The entity also inherits all the relationships
in which the superclass participates. Notice that a subclass, with its own specific (or
local) attributes and relationships together with all the attributes and relationships it
inherits from the superclass, can be considered an entity type in its own right.*

4.2 Specialization and Generalization

4.2.1 Specialization

Specialization is the process of defining a set of subclasses of an entity type; this
entity type is called the superclass of the specialization. The set of subclasses that
forms a specialization is defined on the basis of some distinguishing characteristic
of the entities in the superclass. For example, the set of subclasses (SECRETARY,
ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN} is a specialization of the superclass EMPLOYEE that dis-
tinguishes among employee entities based on the job type of each employee.
We may have several specializations of the same entity type based on different
distinguishing characteristics. For example, another specialization of the
EMPLOYEE entity type may yield the set of subclasses {SALARIED_EMPLOYEE,
HOURLY_EMPLOYEE}; this specialization distinguishes among employees based on
the method of pay.

Figure 4.1 shows how we represent a specialization diagrammatically in an EER
diagram. The subclasses that define a specialization are attached by lines to a circle
that represents the specialization, which is connected in turn to the superclass. The
subset symbol on each line connecting a subclass to the circle indicates the direction
of the superclass/subclass relationship.” Attributes that apply only to entities of a
particular subclass—such as TypingSpeed of SECRETARY—are attached to the rect-
angle representing that subclass. These are called specific (or local) attributes of
the subclass. Similarly, a subclass can participate in specific relationship types,
such as the HOURLY_EMPLOYEE subclass participating in the BELONGS_TO

4In some object-oriented programming languages, a common restriction is that an entity (or object) has
only one type. This is generally too restrictive for conceptual database modeling.

®There are many alternative notations for specialization; we present the UML notation in Section 4.6 and
other proposed notations in Appendix A.
