TREES

Definition of Tree:
A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that
e There is a special node called the root.
e The remaining nodes are partitioned into n= 0 disjoint sets T1, ---, Tn, where each of these
sets are called the subtrees of the root.

Example: Consider the tree given below

LEVEL
A) 1
|
B ¢ D 2
T
E F G i I 3 3
K i M) 4

Figure 4.1 A sample Tree

The tree has 13 nodes and has one character as its information. A tree is always drawn with its root
at the top. Here the node A is the root.

> Degree of a node: The number of subtrees of a node is called its degree.
o Example : The degree of A= 3,C = 1, and of F=0.
> Degree of a Tree :The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of the nodes in the tree. The
tree shown in the example has degree 3.
Leaf or terminal nodes or external nodes: Nodes that have degree zero is called the leaf
nodes
o Example: {K.L,F,G.M,LJ} is the set of leaf nodes
> Non-terminal nodes/internal nodes : Nodes that have at least a degree one or two. (nodes
other than the leaf nodes )
o Example: {B,C,D.E.F,H,A} is the set of Non-terminal nodes
> Siblings : Children of the same parent are said to be siblings
o Example : {H,I,J} are siblings.
> The ancestors: all the nodes along the path from the root to that node.
o Example: The ancestors of M are A, D, and H.
> The level of a node is .The root is considered be at level one[1]. If a node is at level 1, then
its children are at level 1+ 1.
> The height or depth is maximum level of any node in the tree. Thus, the depth of the tree in
the example is 4.
