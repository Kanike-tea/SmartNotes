2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces

allow users to login using their account name and password; the apps then provide
a limited menu of options for mobile access to the user data, as well as options such
as paying bills (for banks) or making reservations (for reservation Web sites).

Forms-based Interfaces. A forms-based interface displays a form to each user.
Users can fill out all of the form entries to insert new data, or they can fill out only
certain entries, in which case the DBMS will retrieve matching data for the remain-
ing entries. Forms are usually designed and programmed for naive users as inter-
faces to canned transactions. Many DBMSs have forms specification languages,
which are special languages that help programmers specify such forms. SQL* Forms
is a form-based language that specifies queries using a form designed in conjunc-
tion with the relational database schema. Oracle Forms is a component of the Ora-
cle product suite that provides an extensive set of features to design and build
applications using forms. Some systems have utilities that define a form by letting
the end user interactively construct a sample form on the screen.

Graphical User Interfaces. A GUI typically displays a schema to the user in dia-
grammatic form. The user then can specify a query by manipulating the diagram.
In many cases, GUIs utilize both menus and forms.

Natural Language Interfaces. These interfaces accept requests written in Eng-
lish or some other language and attempt to understand them. A natural language
interface usually has its own schema, which is similar to the database conceptual
schema, as well as a dictionary of important words. The natural language interface
refers to the words in its schema, as well as to the set of standard words in its dic-
tionary, that are used to interpret the request. If the interpretation is successful, the
interface generates a high-level query corresponding to the natural language request
and submits it to the DBMS for processing; otherwise, a dialogue is started with the
user to clarify the request.

Keyword-based Database Search. These are somewhat similar to Web search
engines, which accept strings of natural language (like English or Spanish) words
and match them with documents at specific sites (for local search engines) or Web
pages on the Web at large (for engines like Google or Ask). They use predefined
indexes on words and use ranking functions to retrieve and present resulting docu-
ments in a decreasing degree of match. Such “free form” textual query interfaces are
not yet common in structured relational databases, although a research area called
keyword-based querying has emerged recently for relational databases.

Speech Input and Output. Limited use of speech as an input query and speech
as an answer to a question or result of a request is becoming commonplace. Appli-
cations with limited vocabularies, such as inquiries for telephone directory, flight
arrival/departure, and credit card account information, are allowing speech for
input and output to enable customers to access this information. The speech input
is detected using a library of predefined words and used to set up the parameters
that are supplied to the queries. For output, a similar conversion from text or num-
bers into speech takes place.
