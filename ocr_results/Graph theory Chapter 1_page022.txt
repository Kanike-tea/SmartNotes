1.2.1. Vertex degree and Handshaking property
Let G = (V,E) be a graph and v be a vertex of G. Then, the number of edges of G that are
incident on v (that is, the number of edges that join v to other vertices of G) with the loops
counted twice is called the degree of the vertex v and is denoted by deg(v), or d(v).*

The degrees of all vertices of a graph arranged in non-decreasing order is called the degree
sequence of the graph. Also, the minimum of the degrees of vertices of a graph is called the

degree of the graph.
For example, the degrees of vertices of the graph shown in Figure 1.33 are as given below.

dvi) =3, d(v2)=4, d(v3)=4, d(v4) = 3.

Therefore, the degree sequence of this graph is 3, 3, 4, 4, and the degree of the graph is 3.
Note that the loop at v3 is counted twice for determining the degree of v3.

Isolated Vertex, Pendant Vertex

A vertex in a graph which is not an end vertex of any edge of the graph is called an isolated
vertex. Obviously, a vertex is an isolated vertex if and only if its degree is zero.

A vertex of degree 1 is called a pendant vertex. An edge incident on a pendant vertex is
called a pendant edge.

In the graph shown in Figure 1.34, the vertices v4 and v¢ are isolated vertices, v5 and v7 are
Pendant vertices and the edges e4 and es are pendant edges.
