1.3.2 Plant Based Proteins

Plant-based proteins are proteins derived from plant sources, such as legumes, grains, nuts,
and seeds. They are becoming increasingly popular as a alternative to animal-based proteins,

especially for those following a vegetarian or vegan diet. Here are some benefits of plant-based
proteins:

e Sustainable: Plant-based protein sources are more environmentally sustainable than

animal based sources, as they require fewer resources to produce and generate fewer
greenhouse gas emissions.

Nutrient-rich: Many plant-based protein sources are also rich in other essential
nutrients, such as fibre, vitamins, and minerals.

Versatile: Plant-based proteins can be used in a variety of ways, including as a protein
supplement, in smoothies, or as an ingredient in various recipes.

Hypoallergenic: Plant-based proteins are often better tolerated than animal-based

proteins, making them a good option for people with food allergies or sensitivities.
