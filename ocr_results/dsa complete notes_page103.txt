If the element is present or if the tree is empty the function Modifiedsearch returns NULL. If the
element is not present it retrun a pointer to the last node searched.

Modifiedsearch(Treenode *root,int k)

{
TreeNode *temp,*prev;
temp==node;
prev=NULL;
If(temp==NULL)
return(NULL);
while(temp!=NULL)
{
if(temp->data.key==k)
{
printf(“element already found”);
return(NULL);
}
if(key<temp->data.key)
{
Prev=temp;
temp=temp->rcchild;
}
else
{
Prev=temp;
Temp=temp->rchild;
}
}
retrun(prev);
}

Deletion from a binary search tree: Suppose T is a a binary search tree. The function to
delete an item from tree T first search the tree to find the location of the node with the item
and the location of the parent of N and the deletion of the node N depends on three cases:

Case 1: N has no children. Then N is deleted from T by replacing the location of the node N in the
parent(N) by the NULL pointer
