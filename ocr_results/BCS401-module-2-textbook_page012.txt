Topological Sorting

In this section, we discuss an important problem for directed graphs, with a
variety of applications involving prerequisite-restricted tasks. Before we pose this
problem, though, let us review a few basic facts about directed graphs themselves.
A directed graph, or digraph for short, is a graph with directions specified for all
its edges (Figure 4.5a is an example). The adjacency matrix and adjacency lists are
still two principal means of representing a digraph. There are only two notable
differences between undirected and directed graphs in representing them: (1) the
adjacency matrix of a directed graph does not have to be symmetric; (2) an edge
in a directed graph has just one (not two) corresponding nodes in the digraph’s
adjacency lists.
