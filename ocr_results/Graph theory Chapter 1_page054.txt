G, and Gy, itis denoted by Gj AG2. Thus,

G,\AG2 = (Vi U V2, E,AE2).

For the two graphs G; and G2 shown in Figures 1.79(a) and (b), their union, intersection
and ring sum are shown in Figures 1.80(a), (b) and (c) respectively.

Decomposition
We say that a graph G is decomposed (or partitioned) into two subgraphs G, and G2 if

G,UG2=G. and G,G2 = Null graph.

Deletion

If v is a vertex ina graph G, then G — v denotes the subgraph of G obtained by deleting
"and all edges incident on v, from G. This subgraph, G = v, is referred to as vertex-deleted
subgraph of G.

It should be noted that the deletion of a vertex always includes the deletion of all edges
incident on that vertex.
