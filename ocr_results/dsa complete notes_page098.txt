Threaded Binary Tree
¢ When we represent the tree in memory, we must be able to distinguish between threads and
normal pointers.
e This is done by adding two additional fields to the node structure, leftThread and
rightThread.
e Assume that ptr is an arbitrary node in a threaded tree.
o Ifptr — leftThread = TRUE, then ptr— leftChild contains a thread; otherwise it
contains a pointer to the left child.
o Similarly, if ptr + rightThread = TRUE, then ptr — rightChild contains a thread;
otherwise it contains a pointer to the right child.

This node structure is defined as follows
struct node{
short int leftThread;
struct node * leftChild;
char data;
thread node *rightChild;
short int rightThread;
B
typedef struct node ThreadNode;

e In Figure two threads have been left dangling: one in the left child of H, the other in the right
child of G.
To avoid loose threads, a header node is assumed for all threaded binary trees.
The original tree is the left subtree of the header node.
e Anempty binary tree is represented by its header node as in figure below

leftthread leftchild data Rightchild rightthread

The complete memory representation for the tree is as below
