30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security

complete document. Additionally, the XML signature specification defines mecha-
nisms for countersigning and transformations—so-called canonicalization—to
ensure that two instances of the same text produce the same digest for signing even
if their representations differ slightly; for example, in typographic white space.

The XML Encryption Syntax and Processing specification defines XML vocabulary
and processing rules for protecting confidentiality of XML documents in whole or in
part and of non-XML data as well. The encrypted content and additional processing
information for the recipient are represented in well-formed XML so that the result
can be further processed using XML tools. In contrast to other commonly used tech-
nologies for confidentiality, such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer—a leading Internet
security protocol) and virtual private networks, XML encryption also applies to parts
of documents and to documents in persistent storage. Database systems such as
PostgreSQL or Oracle support JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects as a data
format and have similar facilities for JSON objects like those defined above for XML.

30.3.5 Access Control Policies for the Web
and Mobile Appplications

Publicly accessible Web application environments present a unique challenge to
database security. These systems include those responsible for handling sensitive or
private information and include social networks, mobile application API servers,
and e-commerce transaction platforms.

Electronic commerce (e-commerce) environments are characterized by any trans-
actions that are done electronically. They require elaborate access control policies
that go beyond traditional DBMSs. In conventional database environments, access
control is usually performed using a set of authorizations stated by security officers
or users according to some security policies. Such a simple paradigm is not well
suited for a dynamic environment like e-commerce. Furthermore, in an e-com-
merce environment the resources to be protected are not only traditional data but
also knowledge and experience. Such peculiarities call for more flexibility in speci-
fying access control policies. The access control mechanism must be flexible enough
to support a wide spectrum of heterogeneous protection objects.

Because many reservation, ticketing, payment, and online shopping systems pro-
cess information that is protected by law, the security architecture that goes beyond
simple database access control must be put in place to protect the information.
When an unauthorized party inappropriately accesses protected information, it
amounts to a data breach, which has significant legal and financial consequences.
This unauthorized party could be an adversary that actively seeks to steal protected
information or may be an employee who overstepped his or her role or incorrectly
distributed protected information to others. Inappropriate handling of credit card
data, for instance, has led to significant data breaches at major retailers.

In conventional database environments, access control is usually performed using a
set of authorizations stated by security officers. But in Web applications, it is all too
