Bronchi: The trachea branches into two main bronchi, one for each lung. The bronchi are larger airways that continue to

branch into smaller airways called bronchioles.

Bronchioles: The bronchioles are smaller airways that eventually lead to the alveoli. They are surrounded by tiny air sacs

called alveoli, which are the sites of gas exchange.

Alveoli: The alveoli are tiny air sacs that are lined with a network of capillaries. This close proximity of the alveoli and

capillaries allows for efficient diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air in the alveoli and the bloodstream.

The gas exchange mechanism in the lung involves the transfer of oxygen from the air in the alveoli to the bloodstream,
and the transfer of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the air in the alveoli. This process is known as diffusion and

occurs due to differences in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

. Oxygen Diffusion: The partial pressure of oxygen in the air in the alveoli is higher than the partial pressure of
oxygen in the bloodstream. This difference creates a gradient that causes oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli into the

bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells to form oxyhemoglobin.

. Carbon Dioxide Diffusion: The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is higher than the partial
pressure of carbon dioxide in the air in the alveoli. This difference creates a gradient that causes carbon dioxide to diffuse

from the bloodstream into the alveoli, where it is exhaled.

6. What are stents? Give an account on the stent design and materials used for the manufacturer of stents.
Ans. Stents are small, metal mesh devices that are used to treat blockages in blood vessels. They are
typically used in procedures such as angioplasty, where a balloon catheter is used to open up a blocked

blood vessel and a stent is placed to keep it open.

The design of stents can vary depending on the type of stent and the specific medical condition it is used

to treat. Some common design features of stents include:
