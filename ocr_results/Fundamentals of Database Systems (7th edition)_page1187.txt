30.10.3 How Data Labels and User Labels Work Together

A user’s label indicates the information the user is permitted to access. It also deter-
mines the type of access (read or write) that the user has on that information. A
row’s label shows the sensitivity of the information that the row contains as well as
the ownership of the information. When a table in the database has a label-based
access associated with it, a row can be accessed only if the user’s label meets certain
criteria defined in the policy definitions. Access is granted or denied based on the
result of comparing the data label and the session label of the user.

Compartments allow a finer classification of sensitivity of the labeled data. All data
related to the same project can be labeled with the same compartment. Compart-
ments are optional; a label can contain zero or more compartments.

Groups are used to identify organizations as owners of the data with corresponding
group labels. Groups are hierarchical; for example, a group can be associated with a
parent group.

If a user has a maximum level of SENSITIVE, then the user potentially has access to
all data having levels SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL, and UNCLASSIFIED. This user has
no access to HIGHLY_SENSITIVE data. Figure 30.5 shows how data labels and user
labels work together to provide access control in Oracle label security.

As shown in Figure 30.5, User 1 can access the rows 2, 3, and 4 because his maxi-
mum level is HS (Highly_Sensitive). He has access to the FIN (Finance) compart-
ment, and his access to group WR (Western Region) hierarchically includes group
