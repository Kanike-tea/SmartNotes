5.0.3 Types of Hash Functions

1. Division Method: It is the most simple method of hashing an integer x. This method divides x

y M and then uses the remainder obtained. In this case, the hash function can be given as [h(x)}

— x mod M |The division method is quite good for just about any value of M and since it

requires only a single division operation, the method works very fast. However, extra care
should be taken to select a suitable value for M. Generally, it is best to choose M to be a prime
number because making M a prime number increases the likelihood that the keys are mapped
with a uniformity in the output range of values.

Example: If the record to be stored {54,72, 89,37} is to be placed in the hash table and if the table
size is 10

H(Key) = Record % Size i.e:

H (54) =54%10=4

H (72) =72%10=2

H (89) =89%10=9

H (37) =37%10=7

2. Mid-Square Method:
¢ Here, the key K is squared. A number ‘I’ in the middle of K’ is selected by removing the digits
from both ends. H(k)=1
