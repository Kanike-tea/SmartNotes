to compute the address of sibling and parent nodes efficiently. Each new take place at the next

5.33: Winner tree of fig.5.32 after one record has been output and the tree restructured.
4.2.1 Loser Tree:

After the record with the smallest key value is output, the winner tree of Figure 5.32 is to be
restructured. Since the record with the smallest key value is in run 4this re- involves inserting
the next record from this run into the tree. The next record has key value 15. are played between
sibling nodes along the path from node 11 to the root. Since these sibling nodes represent the
losers of played earlier, we can simplify the process by placing in each nonleaf node a pointer
to the record that loses the rather than to the winner of the tournament. A selection tree in which
each nonleaf node retains a pointer to the loser is called a loser tree. Figure 5.34 shows the

loser tree that to the winner tree of Figure 5.32. For, each node the key value of a record rather
