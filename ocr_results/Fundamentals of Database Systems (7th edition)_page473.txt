been designed using the ER graph-structured data model. Section 13.6.2
discusses the problem of cycles and how to deal with it.

All of these approaches have received considerable attention. We focus on the
fourth approach in Section 13.6, because it gives a good conceptual understanding
of the differences between the XML tree data model and the traditional database
models based on flat files (relational model) and graph representations (ER model).
But first we give an overview of XML query languages in Section 13.5.

13.5 XML Languages

There have been several proposals for XML query languages, and two query language
standards have emerged. The first is XPath, which provides language constructs for
specifying path expressions to identify certain nodes (elements) or attributes within
an XML document that match specific patterns. The second is XQuery, which is a
more general query language. XQuery uses XPath expressions but has additional con-
structs. We give an overview of each of these languages in this section. Then we dis-
cuss some additional languages related to HTML in Section 13.5.3.

13.5.1 XPath: Specifying Path Expressions in XML

An XPath expression generally returns a sequence of items that satisfy a certain pat-
tern as specified by the expression. These items are either values (from leaf nodes)
or elements or attributes. The most common type of XPath expression returns a col-
lection of element or attribute nodes that satisfy certain patterns specified in the
expression. The names in the XPath expression are node names in the XML docu-
ment tree that are either tag (element) names or attribute names, possibly with
additional qualifier conditions to further restrict the nodes that satisfy the pattern.
Two main separators are used when specifying a path: single slash (/) and double
slash (//). A single slash before a tag specifies that the tag must appear as a direct
child of the previous (parent) tag, whereas a double slash specifies that the tag can
appear as a descendant of the previous tag at any level. To refer to an attribute name
instead of an element (tag) name, the prefix @ is used before the attribute name. Let
us look at some examples of XPath as shown in Figure 13.6.

The first XPath expression in Figure 13.6 returns the company root node and all its
descendant nodes, which means that it returns the whole XML document. We
should note that it is customary to include the file name in the XPath query. This
allows us to specify any local file name or even any path name that specifies a file on
the Web. For example, if the COMPANY XML document is stored at the location

www.company.com/info.XML
then the first XPath expression in Figure 13.6 can be written as
doc(www.company.com/info.XML)/company

This prefix would also be included in the other examples of XPath expressions.
