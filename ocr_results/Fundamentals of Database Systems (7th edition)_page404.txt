same type and class declarations of the ODL and the OOPL. In general, it is possible
to define several persistent collections for the same class definition, if desired.

12.1.5 Type Hierarchies and Inheritance

Simplified Model for Inheritance. Another main characteristic of ODBs is that
they allow type hierarchies and inheritance. We use a simple OO model in this
section—a model in which attributes and operations are treated uniformly—since
both attributes and operations can be inherited. In Section 12.3, we will discuss the
inheritance model of the ODMG standard, which differs from the model discussed
here because it distinguishes between two types of inheritance. Inheritance allows
the definition of new types based on other predefined types, leading to a type (or
class) hierarchy.

A type is defined by assigning it a type name and then defining a number of attri-
butes (instance variables) and operations (methods) for the type.'? In the simplified
model we use in this section, the attributes and operations are together called func-
tions, since attributes resemble functions with zero arguments. A function name
can be used to refer to the value of an attribute or to refer to the resulting value of an
operation (method). We use the term function to refer to both attributes and oper-
ations, since they are treated similarly in a basic introduction to inheritance.!*

'2In this section we will use the terms type and class as meaning the same thing—namely, the attributes
and operations of some type of object.

'8We will see in Section 12.3 that types with functions are similar to the concept of interfaces as used in
ODMG ODL.
