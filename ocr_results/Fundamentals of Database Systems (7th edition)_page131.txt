Consider an entity type SECTION in a UNIVERSITY database, which describes
the section offerings of courses. The attributes of SECTION are
Section_number, Semester, Year, Course_number, Instructor, Room_no (where
section is taught), Building (where section is taught), Weekdays (domain is
the possible combinations of weekdays in which a section can be offered
{‘MWP’, ‘MW’, ‘TT’, and so on}), and Hours (domain is all possible
time periods during which sections are offered {‘9-9:50 a.m.’, ‘10-10:50
AM.’,..., ‘3:30-4:50 p.m.’, ‘5:30-6:20 p.m.’, and so on}). Assume that
Section_number is unique for each course within a particular semes-
ter/year combination (that is, if a course is offered multiple times during
a particular semester, its section offerings are numbered 1, 2, 3, and so
on). There are several composite keys for section, and some attributes
are components of more than one key. Identify three composite keys,
and show how they can be represented in an ER schema diagram.

Cardinality ratios often dictate the detailed design of a database. The cardi-
nality ratio depends on the real-world meaning of the entity types involved
and is defined by the specific application. For the following binary relation-
ships, suggest cardinality ratios based on the common-sense meaning of the
entity types. Clearly state any assumptions you make.

Entity 1 Cardinality Ratio Entity 2
1. STUDENT SOCIAL_SECURITY_CARD
2. STUDENT TEACHER
3. CLASSROOM WALL
4. COUNTRY CURRENT_PRESIDENT
5. COURSE TEXTBOOK
6. ITEM (that can be found ORDER
in an order)
7. STUDENT CLASS
8. CLASS INSTRUCTOR
9. INSTRUCTOR OFFICE
10. EBAY_AUCTION_ITEM EBAY_BID

Consider the ER schema for the MOVIES database in Figure 3.25.

Assume that MOVIES is a populated database. ACTOR is used as a generic term
and includes actresses. Given the constraints shown in the ER schema, respond
to the following statements with True, False, or Maybe. Assign a response of
Maybe to statements that, although not explicitly shown to be True, cannot be
proven False based on the schema as shown. Justify each answer.

a. There are no actors in this database that have been in no movies.
b. There are some actors who have acted in more than ten movies.
c. Some actors have done a lead role in multiple movies.

d. A movie can have only a maximum of two lead actors.
