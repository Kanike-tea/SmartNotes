The formulated Null and Alternative hypothesis is , Ho; P = a specified value , H;: P # a specified value

Test of significance of Difference between two sample proportions:

To test the significance of the difference between the samples proportions, the test statistic under the null

hypothesis Ho that there is no significance difference between the two sample proportions,

We have Z = —P1=?2__WhereP = ™Ps*™2P2 op = 292 ang P+Q=1,

Here p,andpzare the sample proportions in respect of an attribute corresponding to two large samples of size
n,andn, drawn from the two populations.

PROBLEMS
1. A coin is tossed 400 times and it turns up head 216 times. Di
Sol.

Set the null hypothesis Hy; P = ;

ss whether the coin may be regarded as unbiased one.

Set the Alternative hypothesis Hy: P + ;
The level of significance a = 0.05 (5%)
«. The test statistic Z = ?—2 , where PtQ=1 => Q=1-P

Given, the coin is tossed and it turns up in the equal proportion

P=~>Q=1-P

And the coin turns up head 216 times when it tossed n = 400times

0.04
v0.000625

At 5% level, the tabulated value of Z,is 1.96
Since |Z| = 1.6 < 1.96
Hence, the null hypothesis is accepted at 5% level of significance and the coin may be regarded as unbiased.
2. Ina city of sample of 500 people, 280 are tea drinkers and the rest are coffee drinkers. Can we assume that both coffee
and tea are equally popular in this city at 5% Los.
Sol.
Set the null hypothesis Hy; P = =( Both coffee and tea drinkers are equally popular)
Set the Alternative hypothesis H,: P + ;
The level of significance a = 0.05 (5%)
