¢ Worst case occurs when key element is not found in the array or when the element is in the
last position. Thus in worst case the running time is proportional to n C(n) «O(n)

e The running time of the average case uses the probabilistic notation of expectation. Number
of comparison can be any number from | to n and each occurs with probability p= 1/n then
c(n) 1.1/m 42.1 /nt.....0...0. 1/0

=n(n+1)/2.1

BINARY SEARCH: This algorithm is useful when the array is sorted.
For example when searching for a name in a telephone directory this algorithm is more efficient
than linear search as the number of element to search is reduced by half in each iteration.

#include<stdio.h>

#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
int a[10],i,.key,mid,lowhigh,n;
printf("enter the size of the array : ");
scanf("%d" ,&n);
printf("enter the elements of the array in ascending order\n");
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
scanf("%d" ,&a[i]);
printf("enter the key \n");
scanf("%d" &key);

low=0;
high=n-1;
while(low<=high)
{
mid=(low+thigh)/2;
if (key==a[mid])

{
printf("element %d found at %d" key ,mid+1);
exit(0);
}
else
{
if (key<a[mid])
high = mid-1;
else
low=mid+1;
t
t
printf("key not found");
return(0);
t

Complexity of binary search algorithm :
¢ The complexity is based on the number of comparison C(n) required to find the key in the array
element.
e Each comparison reduces the sample size in half so C(n) is of the order log 2 n +1
