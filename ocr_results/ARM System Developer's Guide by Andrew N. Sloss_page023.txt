general performance of the system, it does not help real-time system response. Note that
many small embedded systems do not require the performance benefits of a cache.

The main memory is large—around 256 KB to 256 MB (or even greater), depending on
the application—and is generally stored in separate chips. Load and store instructions access
the main memory unless the values have been stored in the cache for fast access. Secondary
storage is the largest and slowest form of memory. Hard disk drives and CD-ROM drives
are examples of secondary storage. These days secondary storage may vary from 600 MB
to 60 GB.

1.3.3.2 Width

The memory width is the number of bits the memory returns on each access—typically
8, 16, 32, or 64 bits. The memory width has a direct effect on the overall performance and
cost ratio.

Ifyou have an uncached system using 32-bit ARM instructions and 16-bit-wide memory
chips, then the processor will have to make two memory fetches per instruction. Each fetch
requires two 16-bit loads. This obviously has the effect of reducing system performance,
but the benefit is that 16-bit memory is less expensive.

In contrast, if the core executes 16-bit Thumb instructions, it will achieve better
performance with a 16-bit memory. The higher performance is a result of the core making
only a single fetch to memory to load an instruction. Hence, using Thumb instructions
with 16-bit-wide memory devices provides both improved performance and reduced cost.

Table 1.1 summarizes theoretical cycle times on an ARM processor using different
memory width devices.

1.3.3.3 Types

There are many different types of memory. In this section we describe some of the more
popular memory devices found in ARM-based embedded systems.

Read-only memory (ROM) is the least flexible of all memory types because it contains an
image that is permanently set at production time and cannot be reprogrammed. ROMs are
used in high-volume devices that require no updates or corrections. Many devices also use
a ROM to hold boot code.
