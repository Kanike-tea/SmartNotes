To implement the set union operation, we simply set the parent field of one of the roots to the
other root. We can accomplish this easily if, with each set name, we keep a pointer to the root

of the tree representing that set.

rather than using the set name S; we refer to this set as 0. The transition to set names is easy.
We assume that a table, name [ ], holds the set names. If i is an element in a tree with root 7,

and j has a pointer to entry k in the set name table, then the set name is just name[k].

Definition: Weighting rule for union(i, j). If the number of nodes in tree i is less than the number

in tree j then make j the parent of i; otherwise make i the parent of j.
