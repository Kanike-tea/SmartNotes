4.4 Representation of Disjoint Sets
4.4.1 Introduction

The use of trees in the representation of sets. assume that the elements of the sets are the
numbers 0, 1, 2,. . .n-1. In practice, these numbers might be indices into a symbol table that

stores the actual names of the elements.

For example, if we have 10 elements numbered 0 through 9, we may partition them into three
disjoint sets, 51 = {0, 6, 7, 8), S2 = {1, 4, 9}, and S3 = {2, 3, 5}.

Figure shows one possible representation for these sets.

Possible forest representation of sets
The minimal operations that we wish to perform on these sets are:
Disjoint set union and Find(i).

4.4.2 Union and Find operations:

to obtain the union of S;.and S> Since we have linked the nodes from children to parent, we

simply make one of the trees a subtree of the other.
