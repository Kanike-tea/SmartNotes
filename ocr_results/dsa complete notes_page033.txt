Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module 1

The function push remains the same except that MAX_STACK_ SIZE is replaced with capacity

void push(element item)

{
if (top >=capacity-1)
stackFullQ);
stack[++top] = item;
i

The code for the pop function remains unchanged element

pop()
{/* delete and return the top element from the stack */
if (top == -1)
return stackEmpty(); /* returns an error key */
return stack[top--];

Stackfull with Array doubling:The code for stackFull is changed. The new code for stackFull
attempts to increase the capacity of the array stack so that we can add an additional element to the
stack. In array doubling, the capacity of the array is doubled whenever it becomes necessary to increase
the capacity of an array.

void stackFull()

{
stack=(int*)realloc(stack, 2 * capacity * sizeof(int))
capacity =capacity * 2;

i

Analysis

e In the worst case, the realloc function needs to allocate 2*capacity *sizeof (*stack) bytes of
memory and copy capacity*sizeof (*stack)) bytes of memory from the old array into the new
one.

e Under the assumptions that memory may be allocated in O(1) time and that a stack element
can be copied in O(1) time, the time required by array doubling is O(capacity). The total time
spent in array doubling is of O(n) where n is the total number of push operations.

e Hence even with the time spent on array doubling in the total time of push over all n pushes in
O(n). This conclusion is valid even the stack array is resized by a factor c>1.
