LAB PROGRAM 01 (a)

1 a) Write a python program to find the best of two test average marks out of three test’s

marks accepted from the user.

Aim: Introduce the Python fundamentals, data types, operators, flow control, and exception

handling in Python.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION
The below program is written in Python and calculates the average of the best two test scores out

of three test scores. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the program:
1. The program starts by prompting the user to enter the three internal marks.
2. The user is prompted to enter marks], marks2, and marks3, respectively.
3. The program then prints the entered marks for reference.
4. The variable small is initialized with the value of m1 (marks1). It is used to keep track of

the smallest mark among the three.

wn

The program checks if small is greater than m2 (marks2). If it is, small is updated to m2.

6. The program then checks if small is greater than m3 (marks3). If it is, small is updated to
m3.

7. After these three checks, the small variable will contain the smallest mark among the
three.

8. The average is calculated using the formula: avg = (m1 + m2 + m3 - small) / 2

9. The smallest mark (small) is subtracted from the sum of all three marks to exclude it

from the average calculation. Then the sum is divided by 2 to get the average of the best

two marks.

10. Finally, the program prints the average of the best two tests out of the three.

PROGRAM

print ("Enter the three internals marks (> zero:")
ml = int(input ("Enter marks1:"))

m2 = int(input ("Enter marks2:"))

m3 int (input ("Enter marks3:") )
print ("Marks1:", m1)

print ("Marks2:", m2)

print ("Marks3:", m3)

small=m1

if small > m2:

small = m2
if small > m3:
