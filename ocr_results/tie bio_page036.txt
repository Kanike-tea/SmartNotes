Biological imaging refers to a wide range of tools and techniques that are used in biological
and health sciences to generate visual representations of different organ systems, diseases,
cellular structures, and even molecular events.

There are many types of biological imaging techniques. These can range from techniques
used in hospitals for imaging bones and internal organs that are deep inside the body to other
imaging techniques for viewing cells and viruses that are too small to be visible to the naked
eye.

There are different types of biological imaging techniques used in research. One of these
is microscopy, or the use of microscopes.

Researchers can use microscopes to examine and analyze internal and external structures of
cells and microorganisms. Microscopes vary in their mechanisms and functions:

Light microscopes employ visible light to magnify small objects.
Electron microscopes use an electron beam to illuminate small objects. There are
two main types of electron microscopes (Fig. 1):

o Transmission electron microscopes are used to view the internal structure of
thin slices of specimen.
o Scanning electron microscopes can show the surface of a specimen in great
detail.
Fluorescent microscopes involve the use of fluorescent dye to illuminate specific
parts of the sample so that only those parts are seen in the microscope.
Confocal microscopes show only one point of the sample at a time, preventing parts
from becoming out of focus which can happen with regular fluorescent microscopy.

10. Explain the AI process for disease diagnosis and its various applications in
medical field.

Answer:

Accurate diagnosis of diseases is crucial for treatment planning and ensuring the well-
being of patients. Human errors limit the diagnosis accuracy and efficiency, especially in
general clinical practice and rural areas, as interpreting medical knowledge is a complex
and cognitively challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as
convolutional neural networks, knowledge graphs, and transformers, are validated as
powerful and promising tools to assist and improve the diagnosis and even treatment of
various diseases. The application of AI within the diagnostic process supports medical
specialists to improve the level of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, thus providing
emergent digitalized healthcare services.
