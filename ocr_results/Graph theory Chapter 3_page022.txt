3.3. Spanning Trees 175
aaa ee Ee RL ee PR i

Conversely, suppose a graph G has a spanning tree T, Since T is a trée, there exists a path
petween every pair of vertices in T. Since T is a Spanning tree, T contains all vertices of G.
Therefore, there is a path between every pair of vertices in G. Hence G is connected.

This completes the proof of the theorem. e

Theorem 2 . With respect to any of its Spanning trees,

a connected graph of n vertices and m
edges has n — | branches and m-—n + | chords.

Proof: Let G be a connected graph of n.vertices and m edges and T be a spanning tree of

G. Then T contains all vertices of G; therefore, it has n vertices. Consequently, T has n — 1

branches (edges). Therefore, the number of edges in G that are not in T is m-(n-1) = m-n+l1.

This means that, w.r.t. 7, G has m —n +1 chords.
The theorem is proved.

Remark: In view of the above theorem it follows that in order to obtain a spanning tree’ of
aconnected graph with n vertices and m edges, the number of edges to be removed from the
graph ism—n+ 1.

wee Find all the spanning trees of the graph shown below:

Figure 3.23

> Aspanning tree of the given graph must be a subgraph which is a tree and must contain all
the vertices of the graph. Since there are four vertices, this tree must have three edges.. Each
Such tree is got by deleting one edge from the graph. There are four such trees; these are shown
