The mechanism of filtration in the kidneys is a complex process that involves multiple steps
to remove waste and excess fluids from the bloodstream. The following is a summary of the
steps involved in the filtration process:

e Blood enters the kidney through the renal arteries and flows into tiny filtering units called
glomeruli.

e At the glomerulus, the pressure in the blood vessels causes a portion of the plasma and
dissolved substances to filter out and enter a structure called Bowman's capsule.

e In Bowman's capsule, the filtrate is then transferred into the renal tubules, which are the
main filtering units of the kidneys.

e Inthe renal tubules, the filtrate passes through a series of specialized cells, such as proximal
tubular cells and distal tubular cells, which reabsorb important substances such as glucose,
amino acids, and electrolytes back into the bloodstream.

e Atthe same time, the renal tubules secrete waste products, such as urea and creatinine, back
into the filtrate.

e Finally, the filtered fluid, now known as urine, is transported through the renal pelvis and
ureters to the bladder, where it is eventually eliminated from the body.

This process of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion helps to maintain the proper balance
of fluids and electrolytes in the body, as well as to remove waste and excess substances.
