This completes the proof of the theorem. e

How many edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles exist in the complete graph with seven
vertices? Also, draw the graph to show these Hamilton cycles,
» According to Theorem 3, the complete graph K,, has din

of Theorem 3, one of these Hamilton cycles appears as shown in Figure 1.135,

Suppose a new club has an odd number of members, say n = 2k + 1, where k is
“Positive integer. These members meet each day for lunch at a round table. They decide to sit
m such a way that every member has different neighbours at each lunch. How many days can
