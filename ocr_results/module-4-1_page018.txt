Data Structures and Applications (15CS33)

The variable root points to the header node of the tree, while root —leftChild points to the
start of the first node of the actual tree. This is true for all threaded trees. Here the problem of
the loose threads is handled by pointing to the head node called root.

Inorder Traversal of a Threaded Binary Tree

e By using the threads, an inorder traversal can be performed without making use ofa
stack.

e For any node, ptr, in a threaded binary tree, if ptr—rightThread =TRUE, the inorder
successor of ptr is ptr srightChild by definition of the threads. Otherwise we obtain
the inorder successor of ptr by following a path of left-child links from the right-
child of ptr until we reach a node with leftThread = TRUE.

e The function insucc () finds the inorder successor of any node in a threaded tree
without using a stack.

threadedpointer insucc(threadedPointer tree)
{ /* find the inorder successor of tree in a threaded binary tree */
threadedpointer temp;
temp = tree—rightChild;
if (!tree—rightThread)
while (!temp—leftThread)
temp = temp—leftChild;
return temp;

Program: Finding inorder successor of a node

To perform inorder traversal make repeated calls to insucc ( ) function

void tinorder (threadedpointer tree)

{

Threadedpointer temp = tree;

for(s :){
temp = insucc(temp);
if (temp ==tree) break;
printf(‘%3c”, temp—data

}
}
