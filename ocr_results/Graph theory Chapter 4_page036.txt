» From the above Figure, we note that the towns are the ia Si (and their Wej th
(distances)).from c to other vertices:
(1) Path from cto f: ¢ > f; distance 6,
(2) Path from c to h: ¢ 3 f oh; distance 10, ;
(3) Path from cto g:e 3 f 3h 8; distance 14,
(4) Path from c to is c~> f+ a; distance 17,

(5). Path from c to b: ¢ = f > a- b; distance 22.
