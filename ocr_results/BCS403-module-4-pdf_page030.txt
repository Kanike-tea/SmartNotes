Database Management System [BCS403]

= A transaction includes read_item and write_item operations to access and update DB.

(a) Figure 21.2
- s Two sample transac-
read_item(X); read_item(X); tions. (a) Transaction
X=X-N; X=X+M; T,. (b) Transaction T.

write_item(X); write_item(X);
read_item(Y);

Y=Y+N;

write_item(Y);

= The read-set of a transaction is the set of all items that the transaction reads
= The write-set is the set of all items that the transaction writes

= For example, the read-set of 71 in Figure 21.2 is {X, Y}and its write-set is also {X, Y}.

5.2.3 Why Concurrency Control Is\Needed

= Several problems can occur when concurrent transactions execute in an uncontrolled
manner
= Example:
+ We consider an Airline reservation DB
+ Each records is stored for an airline flight which includes Number of reserved seats
among other information.
Types of problems we may encounter:

1. The Lost Update Problem
The Temporary Update (or Dirty Read) Problem

The Incorrect Summary Problem

pe

The Unrepeatable Read Problem

read_item(X); read_item(X);
X =X+M; X=X-N;
write_item(X); write_item(X);

read_item(Y);
Y=Y+N;
write_item(Y);
