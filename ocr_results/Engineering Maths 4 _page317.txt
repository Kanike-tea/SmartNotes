‘Definition If for every x belonging to the range of a continuous anda variable X,
we assign a real number f(x ) a the conditions

Cumulative distribution function

If X is a continuous random Gaciable with probability density fenctioas f (x) then
the function F(x) defined by .

x

F(x) =P(X<x)= | f(x)a& aye

is called the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of X.
It is evident from (2) that
d
F(x) = P(X $x) = P(-« <X <x) and = [F(x)] = f(x)

It should be noted that the probability of a continuous random variable taking a
particular value is zero whereas the probability that it take values in an interval is a
positive quantity.

If r is any real number then

P(x2r)= J f(x)de .@)
r shed
P(x<r)=1-P(x2 r) .

ie, P(xer)=1- J f(x)a . (4)

Remark : j f(x) dx = 1 geometrically means that the area bounded by the curve f(x)

and the x - axis is equal to unity. °

Also P(a < x <b) is equal to the area of the region bounded by the curve f(x),
the x -axis.and the ordinates x = a and x = b.
