Web Database
Programming Using PHP

n the previous chapter, we gave an overview of data-

base programming techniques using traditional pro-
gramming languages, and we used the Java and C programming languages in our
examples. We now turn our attention to how databases are accessed from scripting
languages. Many Internet applications that provide Web interfaces to access infor-
mation stored in one or more databases use scripting languages. These languages
are often used to generate HTML documents, which are then displayed by the Web
browser for interaction with the user. In our presentation, we assume that the
reader is familiar with basic HTML concepts.

Basic HTML is useful for generating static Web pages with fixed text and other
objects, but most Internet applications require Web pages that provide interactive
features with the user. For example, consider the case of an airline customer who
wants to check the arrival time and gate information of a particular flight. The user
may enter information such as a date and flight number in certain fields of the Web
page. The Web interface will send this information to the application program,
which formulates and submits a query to the airline database server to retrieve the
information that the user needs. The database information is sent back to the Web
page for display. Such Web pages, where part of the information is extracted from
databases or other data sources, are called dynamic Web pages. The data extracted
and displayed each time will be for different flights and dates.

There are various techniques for programming dynamic features into Web pages.
We will focus on one technique here, which is based on using the PHP open source
server side scripting language. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but
now stands for PHP Hypertext Processor. PHP has experienced widespread use. The
interpreters for PHP are provided free of charge and are written in the C language so
