652 Appendix D Instruction Cycle Timings

Table D.1

Standard cycle abbreviations.

Abbreviation — Meaning

B

M

The number of busy-wait cycles issued by a coprocessor. This depends
on the coprocessor design.

The number of multiplier iteration cycles. This depends on the value in
register Rs. Each implementation section contains a table showing how
to calculate M from Rs for that implementation.

The number of words to transfer in a load or store multiple. This includes
pcif it is in the register list. N must be at least one.

Read the value in the “Cycles” column. This is the number of cycles the instruction
usually takes, assuming the instruction passes its condition codes and there are no inter-
actions with other instructions. The cycle count may depend on one of the abbreviations
in Table D.1.

If the “Notes” column contains any notes of the form +k if condition, then add on to
your cycle count all the additions that apply.

Look for interlock conditions that will cause the processor to stall. These are occasions
where an instruction attempts to use the result of a previous instruction before it
is ready. Unless otherwise stated, input registers are required on the first cycle of the
instruction and output results are available at the end of the last cycle of the instruction.
However, implementations with multiple execute stage pipelines can require input
operands early and produce output operands later. Table D.2 defines the statements
we use in the “Notes” sections to describe this.

If your instruction fails its condition codes, then it is not executed. Usually this costs
one cycle. However, on some implementations, instructions may cost multiple cycles
even if they are not executed. Look for a note of the form “[k cycles if not executed].”
