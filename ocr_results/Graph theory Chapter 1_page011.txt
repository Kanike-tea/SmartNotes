In our discussions here, by a graph we will mean a general graph, unless otherwise men-
tioned.

In may situations, the names assigned to vertices are inconsequential. In such situations,
we do not assign any names to the vertices. Such graphs are called unlabeled graphs. On
the other hand, if names are assigned to vertices of a graph (for some specific purpose or upon
certain grounds), the graph is called a labeled graph. For example, the graphs shown in Figures
1,13 to 1.16 are labeled graphs. The graph shown in Figure 1.17 is unlabeled.

‘In a multigraph, the edge set is a multiset.
