y’ .
51. Solve: y”+— (“aah = nag eee ws

>> Multiplying the given equation by? and writing 6. 25 as $ 25/4 = = ¢ 5/2 2p we sie
Py" +3y'+[2-(25P]y = 0 .

This problem is similiar to the previous one where n= 2/5. ,

Thus the loach of the given equation in terms of Besel functions is,

¥ = Joys (x) +b] 4 5(x)

52. Show that the solution of the equation .
n SIN 3 cos x.
Vi 2 VE

>> Comparing the given = with Bessel’s eration

Py" xy’+(2-1A)y =0 is

Py" txy"+(2- w)y =0, "we have a -V4 or eae
The solution of the given equation in terms of Bessel functions is”

Y= Ah (x)+b]_yp(x)

But Jy (x) = Vn xsinx and J_ wa (4) = 2 MX cosx | [ Refer Problem -24

Hence y = aV2/nx sinx+b2/nx cosx

, sinx ‘cosx

ie., y = (aV2/n) Ve +(bV2/n) zB

Letc, = a V2/n and & =bV/n; Cy and Cy are arbitrary constants. :
