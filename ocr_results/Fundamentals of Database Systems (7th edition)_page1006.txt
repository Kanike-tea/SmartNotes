Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

Event Information versus Duration (or State) Information. A temporal data-
base will store information concerning when certain events occur, or when certain
facts are considered to be true. There are several different types of temporal infor-
mation. Point events or facts are typically associated in the database with a single
time point in some granularity. For example, a bank deposit event may be associ-
ated with the timestamp when the deposit was made, or the total monthly sales of a
product (fact) may be associated with a particular month (say, February 2010).
Note that even though such events or facts may have different granularities, each is
still associated with a single time value in the database. This type of information is
often represented as time series data, as we will discuss in Section 26.2.5. Duration
events or facts, on the other hand, are associated with a specific time period in the
database.!? For example, an employee may have worked in a company from Aug-
ust 15, 2003 until November 20, 2008.

A time period is represented by its start and end time points [START-TIME,
ENDTIME]. For example, the above period is represented as [2003-08-15, 2008-11-20].
Such a time period is often interpreted to mean the set of all time points from start-
time to end-time, inclusive, in the specified granularity. Hence, assuming day gran-
ularity, the period [2003-08-15, 2008-11-20] represents the set of all days from
August 15, 2003, until November 20, 2008, inclusive.'*

Valid Time and Transaction Time Dimensions. Given a particular event or
fact that is associated with a particular time point or time period in the database, the
association may be interpreted to mean different things. The most natural interpre-
tation is that the associated time is the time that the event occurred, or the period
during which the fact was considered to be true in the real world. If this interpreta-
tion is used, the associated time is often referred to as the valid time. A temporal
database using this interpretation is called a valid time database.

However, a different interpretation can be used, where the associated time refers to
the time when the information was actually stored in the database; that is, it is the
value of the system time clock when the information is valid in the system.‘ In this
case, the associated time is called the transaction time. A temporal database using
this interpretation is called a transaction time database.

Other interpretations can also be intended, but these are considered to be the most
common ones, and they are referred to as time dimensions. In some applications,
only one of the dimensions is needed and in other cases both time dimensions are
required, in which case the temporal database is called a bitemporal database. If

'2This is the same as an anchored duration. It has also been frequently called a time interval, but to avoid
confusion we will use period to be consistent with SQL terminology.

'8The representation [2003-08-15, 2008-1 1-20] is called a closed interval representation. One can
also use an open interval, denoted [2003-08-15, 2008-11-21), where the set of points does not include
the end point. Although the latter representation is sometimes more convenient, we shall use closed
intervals except where indicated
