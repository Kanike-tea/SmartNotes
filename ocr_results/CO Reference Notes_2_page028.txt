¢ The signal on the BR line is the logical OR of bus-requests from all devices connected to it.
¢ Then, processor activates BG1 signal indicating to DMA controllers to use bus when it becomes free.
¢ BGI signal is connected to all DMA controllers using a daisy-chain arrangement.
¢ If DMA controller-1 is requesting the bus,
Then, DMA controller-1 blocks propagation of grant-signal to other
devices. Otherwise, DMA controller-1 passes the grant downstream by
asserting BG2.
© Current bus-master indicates to all devices that it is using bus by activating BBSY line.
¢ The bus-arbiter is used to coordinate the activities of all devices requesting memory transfers.
Arbiter ensures that only | request is granted at any given time according to a priority scheme.
(BR > Bus-Request, BG > Bus-Grant, BBSY > Bus Busy).
