3. Double Hashing
In double hashing, we use two hash functions rather than a single function. Double hashing
uses the idea of applying a second hash function to the key when a collision occurs. The
result of the second hash function will be the number of positions form the point of collision
to insert.There are a couple of requirements for the second function:
* it must never evaluate to 0
* must make sure that all cells can be probed
+ A popular second hash function is: Hash2(key) = M - ( key % M ) where M is a prime number
that is smaller than the size of the table. But any independent hash function may also be used.
Example: 37,90,45,22,17,49,55
H(key)=key%10
H)(key)=7-(key%7)
After collision

(Hi(key)+1*Ha(key))%10
