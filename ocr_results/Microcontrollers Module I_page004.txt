4. Embedded System Hardware

Embedded systems can control many different devices, from small sensors found on a

production line, to the real-time control systems used on a NASA space probe.

Fig 4.1: An example of an ARM-based embedded device, a microcontroller.

Figure 5.1 shows a typical embedded device based on an ARM core. Each box represents a
feature or function. The lines connecting the boxes are the buses carrying data. This can be

separated device into four main hardware components:

ARM processor: It controls the embedded device. An ARM processor comprises a core (the
execution engine that processes instructions and manipulates data) and the surrounding
components that interface it with a bus. These components can include memory management

and caches.

Controllers: It coordinates with important functional blocks of the system. Two commonly

found controllers are interrupt and memory controllers.

Peripherals provide all the input-output capability external to the chip and are responsible for

the uniqueness of the embedded device.

Bus: Is used to communicate between different parts of the device.
