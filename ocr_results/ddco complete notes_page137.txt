Pipeline Performance:

The potential increase in performance resulting from pipelining is
proportional to the number of pipeline stages.

However, this increase would be achieved only if pipelined operation as
depicted in Figure a could be sustained without interruption throughout
program execution.

Unfortunately, this is not the True.

Floating point may involve many clock cycle.

For a variety of reasons, one of the pipeline stages may not be able to
complete its processing task for a given instruction in the time allotted. For
example, stage E in the four stage pipeline of Figure b is responsible for
arithmetic and logic operations, and one clock cycle is assigned for this task.
Although this may be sufficient for most operations, some operations, such
as divide, may require more time to complete. Figure shows an example in
which the operation specified in instruction I2 requires three cycles to
complete, from cycle 4 through cycle 6. Thus, in cycles 5 and 6, the Write
stage must be told to do nothing, because it has no data to work with.
Meanwhile, the information in buffer B2 must remain intact until the
Execute stage has completed its operation. This means that stage 2 and, in
turn, stage 1 are blocked from accepting new instructions because the
information in B1 cannot be overwritten. Thus, steps D4 and F5 must be
postponed as shown.

Figure 8.3. Effect of an execution operation taking more than one clock cycle

Pipelined operation in Figure 8.3 is said to have been stalled for two clock

cycles. Normal pipelined operation resumes in cycle 7. Any condition that

causes the pipeline to stall is called a hazard. We have just seen an example
of a data hazard.

1) A data hazard is any condition in which either the source or the
destination operands of an instruction are not available at the time
expected in the pipeline. As a result some operation has to be
delayed, and the pipeline stalls.
