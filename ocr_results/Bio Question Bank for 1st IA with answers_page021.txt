these molecules bind to the receptor, they trigger a cellular response, such as a change in gene
expression or the activation of an intracellular signaling pathway.

e Enzymes: Enzymes are proteins that catalyze specific chemical reactions in the body. Many
enzymes are involved in regulating cellular behavior, such as kinases and phosphatases that

regulate protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively.

Cytoskeleton proteins: Cytoskeleton proteins, such as actin and tubulin, play a critical role in

regulating cell shape, movement, and division.

e Transcription factors: Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene
expression. They play a critical role in regulating cellular differentiation, proliferation, and
apoptosis.

e Adhesion proteins: Adhesion proteins are proteins that are involved in cell-to-cell and cellto-
matrix adhesion. They play a critical role in regulating cell behavior such as cell migration, tissue
development, and wound healing.

e Jon channels: Ion channels are proteins that allow ions to move across the cell membrane. They

play a critical role in regulating cellular excitability and communication.

14. Explain the use of the following

a) Enzymes in Food Industry

Ans. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in food processing,
improving texture, flavor, and shelf life. They are widely used in industries like dairy, baking,

rewing, and meat processing to enhance efficiency and product quality.

1. Major Types of Enzymes Used in Food Processing
A. Carbohydrases (Break Down Carbohydrates)

[Enzyme |/Function [Applications

‘Amylase ||Breaks starch into sugars Baking, brewing, syrup production

Inver tase|[Converts sucrose into glucose & fructosel|Candy, soft drinks, honey processing

[Lactase ||Breaks lactose into glucose & galactose ||Dairy industry (lactose-free milk)

[Pectinase|/Breaks down pectin (plant cell walls) Juice clarification, wine-making
