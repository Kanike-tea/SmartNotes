within these blocks. The main advantage of this design is, if done properly, it provides more precise

results.

LSD: The Latin Square Design gets its name from the fact that we can write it as a square with Latin

letters to correspond to the treatments. The treatment factor levels are the Latin letters in the Latin

square design. The number of rows and columns has to correspond to the number of treatment levels.
