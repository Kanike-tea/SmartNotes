Incidence
When a vertex v of a graph G is an end vertex of an edge e of the graph G, we say that the
edge e is incident on (or to) the vertex v. Since every edge has two end vertices, every edge is
incident on two vertices, one at each end. The two end vertices are coincident if the edge is a
When an edge e is incident on a vertex v, we also say that v is incident with e. Note that
whereas an edge is incident only on two vertices (namely its end vertices), a vertex may be
incident with any number of edges.

Two non-parallel edges are said to be adjacent edges if they are incident on a common
vertex (that is, if they have a vertex in common). Two vertices are said to be adjacent vertices
(or neighbours) if there is an edge joining them. |

In the graph shown in Figure 1.18, A and B are adjacent vertices and e; and e2 are adjacent
edges. But, A and C are not adjacent vertices, and e, and e3 are not adjacent edges.

Complete graph

A simple graph of order > 2 in which there is an edge between every pair of vertices is
called a complete graph, (or a full graph).

In other words, a complete graph is a simple graph of order > 2 in which every pair of
distinct vertices are adjacent.

A complete graph with n (> 2) vertices is denoted by Ky.

Complete graphs with two, three, four and five vertices are shown in Figures 1.19(a) to
1.19(d) respectively. Of these complete graphs, the complete graph with five vertices, namely
Ks (shown in Figure 1.19(d)), is of great importance. This graph is called the Kuratowski’s

first graph.* |
