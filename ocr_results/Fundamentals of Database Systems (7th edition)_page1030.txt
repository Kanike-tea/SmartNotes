Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

based on logic has used Prolog as a starting point. A variation of Prolog called
Datalog is used to define rules declaratively in conjunction with an existing set of
relations, which are themselves treated as literals in the language. Although the lan-
guage structure of Datalog resembles that of Prolog, its operational semantics—that
is, how a Datalog program is executed—is still different.

A deductive database uses two main types of specifications: facts and rules. Facts
are specified in a manner similar to the way relations are specified, except that it is
not necessary to include the attribute names. Recall that a tuple in a relation
describes some real-world fact whose meaning is partly determined by the attribute
names. In a deductive database, the meaning of an attribute value in a tuple is deter-
mined solely by its position within the tuple. Rules are somewhat similar to rela-
tional views. They specify virtual relations that are not actually stored but that can
be formed from the facts by applying inference mechanisms based on the rule spec-
ifications. The main difference between rules and views is that rules may involve
recursion and hence may yield virtual relations that cannot be defined in terms of
basic relational views.

The evaluation of Prolog programs is based on a technique called backward chain-
ing, which involves a top-down evaluation of goals. In the deductive databases that
use Datalog, attention has been devoted to handling large volumes of data stored in
a relational database. Hence, evaluation techniques have been devised that resemble
those for a bottom-up evaluation. Prolog suffers from the limitation that the order
of specification of facts and rules is significant in evaluation; moreover, the order of
literals (defined in Section 26.5.3) within a rule is significant. The execution tech-
niques for Datalog programs attempt to circumvent these problems.

26.5.2 Prolog/Datalog Notation

The notation used in Prolog/Datalog is based on providing predicates with unique
names. A predicate has an implicit meaning, which is suggested by the predicate
name, and a fixed number of arguments. If the arguments are all constant values,
the predicate simply states that a certain fact is true. If, on the other hand, the pred-
icate has variables as arguments, it is either considered as a query or as part of a rule
or constraint. In our discussion, we adopt the Prolog convention that all constant
values in a predicate are either numeric or character strings; they are represented as
identifiers (or names) that start with a lowercase letter, whereas variable names
always start with an uppercase letter.

Consider the example shown in Figure 26.11, which is based on the relational data-
base in Figure 3.6, but in a much simplified form. There are three predicate names:
supervise, superior, and subordinate. The SUPERVISE predicate is defined via a set of
facts, each of which has two arguments: a supervisor name, followed by the name of
a direct supervisee (subordinate) of that supervisor. These facts correspond to the
actual data that is stored in the database, and they can be considered as constituting
a set of tuples in a relation SUPERVISE with two attributes whose schema is
