quantity of specific taste components. For instance, a mass-sensitive sensor may detect changes
in frequency resulting from the binding of bitter compounds to its surface.

Materials Used in Electrical Tongue Technology

Examples of biomaterials used in Electrical Tongue technology include:

Polymers: Polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO), are
often used as the substrate or matrix material in electrical tongue sensors, as they have high
sensitivity to changes in ion concentration and are flexible.

Metal Oxides: Metal oxides, such as tin dioxide (SnO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), are commonly
used in electrical tongue sensors because of their high sensitivity to changes in ion
concentration and ability to undergo changes in electrical conductivity in response to
different tastes.

Carbon Nanotubes: Carbon nanotubes are small tubes made of carbon atoms that have high
electrical conductivity and sensitivity to changes in ion concentration, making them an
attractive material for use in electrical tongue sensors.

Dendrimers: Dendrimers are synthetic, branched nanostructures that can be functionalized
with specific receptors or enzymes to target specific tastes. They are being explored as
potential materials for use in electrical tongue sensors.

Microfluidic Devices: Microfluidic devices, which are small devices that can manipulate
small volumes of fluid, are being used in the development of electrical tongue sensors.
These devices can be made from a variety of materials, including silicon, glass, and
polymers, and can be functionalized with specific receptors or enzymes to target specific
tastes.
