10.3 Database Programming with Function Calls and Class Libraries: SQL/CLI and JDBC

department number and then retrieves the employees who work in that depart-
ment. A loop then iterates over each employee record, one at a time, and prints the
employee’s last name and salary.

10.3.2 JDBC: SQL Class Library for Java Programming

We now turn our attention to how SQL can be called from the Java object-oriented
programming language.’’ The class libraries and associated function calls for this
access are known as JDBC.'* The Java programming language was designed to be
platform independent—that is, a program should be able to run on any type of
computer system that has a Java interpreter installed. Because of this portability,
many RDBMS vendors provide JDBC drivers so that it is possible to access their
systems via Java programs.

JDBC drivers. A JDBC driver is basically an implementation of the classes and
associated objects and function calls specified in JDBC for a particular vendor’s
RDBMS. Hence, a Java program with JDBC objects and function calls can access
any RDBMS that has a JDBC driver available.

Because Java is object-oriented, its function libraries are implemented as classes.
Before being able to process JDBC function calls with Java, it is necessary to import
the JDBC class libraries, which are called java.sql.*. These can be downloaded
and installed via the Web.!”

JDBC is designed to allow a single Java program to connect to several different
databases. These are sometimes called the data sources accessed by the Java pro-
gram, and could be stored using RDBMSs from different vendors residing on dif-
ferent machines. Hence, different data source accesses within the same Java
program may require JDBC drivers from different vendors. To achieve this flexibil-
ity, a special JDBC class called the driver manager class is employed, which keeps
track of the installed drivers. A driver should be registered with the driver manager
before it is used. The operations (methods) of the driver manager class include
getDriver, registerDriver, and deregisterDriver. These can be used to add
and remove drivers for different systems dynamically. Other functions set up and
close connections to data sources.

To load a JDBC driver explicitly, the generic Java function for loading a class can be
used. For example, to load the JDBC driver for the Oracle RDBMS, the following
command can be used:

Class. forName( "oracle. jdbc.driver.OracleDriver")

thought to be an acronym for Java Database Connectivity.
