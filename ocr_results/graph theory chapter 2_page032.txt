2,5. Graph Colouring 133

p The cycle being considered is shown in Figure 2.40, Obviously, this cycle cannot be properly
coloured with a single colour. Assign two’ colours alternatively to the vertices, starting with v,.
Then, the odd vertices v, v3,.vs etc., will have one colour a. and the even vertices vz, 4; ve etc.,
will have a different colour £.

Suppose n is even. Then the vertex v, is an even vertex and therefore will have the colour
B, and the cycle gets properly coloured (because the adjacent vertices v, and v; have different
colours). Therefore, the cycle is 2-chromatic, t

Suppose n is odd. Then the vertex v, is an odd vertex and therefore will have the colour a;
and the cycle is not properly coloured (because, then, the adjacent vertices v, and v; will have
the same colour a). To make the cycle properly coloured, it is enough if v, is assigned a third
colour y. Thus, in this case, the cycle is 3-chromatic. .

Find the chromatic number of the graph shown below.

> We check that the given graph cannot be properly coloured with one or two colours. But it
can be properly coloured with three colours. For example, we can assign colour @ to vertices
v, and v3, colour 8 to vertices v2 and v4, and colour y to the vertex vs. Hence the chromatic

number of the given graph is three. ' i .

| Example 5] Prove that a graph G is 2-chromatic if and only if it is a non-null bipartite graph.
> Suppose a graph G is 2-chromatic, Then it is non-null, and some vertices of .G have one
colour, say @, and the rest of the vertices have another colour, say B. Let V.be the set,of
vertices having colour a and V2 be the set of vertices having colour 8. Then V; U V2 = V; the
Vertex set of G, and V; 1.V2,= ®. Also, no,two vertices of V; can be adjacent and no two
vertices of V can be adjacent. As such, every edge in G has one end in V, and the other end in
Vo. Hence G is a bipartite graph.

: Conversely, suppose G is a non-null bipartite graph. Then the vertex set of G has two
bipartites Vi and V2 such’ that every edge in G has one end in’ V; and another end in V2.
Consequently, G cannot be properly coloured with one colour; because then vertices in Vi
and V2 will have the same colour and every edge has both of its ends of the same colour,
