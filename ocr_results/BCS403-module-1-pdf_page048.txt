= Use singular names for entity types,rather than plural ones, because the entity type name

applies to each individual entity belonging to that entity type

= In ER diagrams, entity type and relationship type names are uppercase letters, attribute names

have their initial letter capitalized, and role names are lowercase letters.

= As a general practice, given a narrative description of the database requirements, the nouns

appearing in the narrative tend to give rise to entity type names, and the verbs tend to indicate

names of relationship types. Attribute names generally arise from additional nouns that

describe the nouns corresponding to entity types.
