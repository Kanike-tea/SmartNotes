MODULE 2

INPUT/OUTPUT ORGANIZATION
ACCESSING I/O-DEVICES

¢ A single bus-structure can be used for connecting I/O-devices to a computer (Figure 7.1).

¢ Each I/O device is assigned a unique set of address.

¢ Bus consists of 3 sets of lines to carry address, data & control signals.

© When processor places an address on address-lines, the intended-device responds to the command.
¢ The processor requests either a read or write-operation.

© The requested-data are transferred over the data-lines.

Bus

Figure 7.1 A single-bus structure.

There are 2 ways to deal with I/O-devices: 1) Memory-mapped I/O & 2) I/O-mapped I/O.
1) Memory-Mapped I/O
>» Memory and I/O-devices share a common address-space.
> Any data-transfer instruction (like Move, Load) can be used to exchange information.
> For example,
Move DATAIN, RO; This instruction sends the contents of location DATAIN to register RO.
Here, DATAIN > address of the input-buffer of the keyboard.
2) 1/O-Mapped I/O
> Memory and I/0 address-spaces are different.
> A special instructions named IN and OUT are used for data-transfer.
>» Advantage of separate I/O space: I/O-devices deal with fewer address-lines.
1/O Interface for an Input Device
1) Address Decoder: enables the device to recognize its address when this
address appears on the address-lines (Figure 7.2).
2) Status Register: contains information relevant to operation of I/O-device.
3) Data Register: holds data being transferred to or from processor. There are 2 types:
i) DATAIN > Input-buffer associated with keyboard.
ii) DATAOUT > Output data buffer of adisplay/printer.
