Pee =— (2) If kis odd, show that the number of vertices in a k-regular graph is even.

(b) Show that it is not possible to have a set of seven persons such thateach person in the
set knows exactly three other persons in the set.

(a) In a k-regular graph, the degree of each vertex is k. Therefore, if such a graph has
n vertices, then the sum of the degrees is nk, and this has to be an even number (by
handshaking property). If k is odd, this is possible only if n is even.

(b) Let G be a graph with seven vertices, each vertex representing a person in the given set
and each edge representing an acquaintance. If each person in the set knows exactly three
other persons in the set, then there will be exactly three edges incident on each vertex,
and the graph G will be 3-regular. This is not possible, because G has an odd number
of vertices. Hence, the graph G of the desired type does not exist. This means that it is
not possible to have a set of seven persons such that each person in the set knows exactly
three other persons in the set. 2

(a) Show that in a complete graph of n vertices (namely K,) the degree of

every vertex is (n — 1) and that the total number of edges is 5n(n - 1).

(b) If K, has m edges, show that n(n + 1) = 2(n +m).

>(a) Recall that a complete graph is a simple graph in which every vertex is joined with every
other vertex through exactly one edge. Therefore, if there are n vertices, each vertex is
joined to (n — 1) vertices through exactly one edge. Thus, there occur n— 1 edges at every
vertex. This means that the degree of every vertex is n — 1.

Consequently, the sum of the degrees of vertices is n(n — 1), By handshaking property,
this sum must be equal to 2m, where m is the number of edges. Thus, n(n — 1) = 2m, or
= 3n(n 1). Thus, K, has $n(n — 1) edges.
