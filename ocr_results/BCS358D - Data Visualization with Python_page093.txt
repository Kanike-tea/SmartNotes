Program 02: Write python program and algorithm to find the sum of even sum and

odd sum for given N number.

ALGORITHM

1. Read the value of N.

2. Initialize variables even_sum and odd_sum to 0.

3. Set a loop variable i to 1.

4. Repeat steps 5 and 6 while i is less than or equal to N.

5. Ifiis even, add i to even_sum.

6.  Ifiis odd, add i to odd_sum.

7. Print the value of even_sum as the sum of even numbers from | to N.

8. Print the value of odd_sum as the sum of odd numbers from 1 to N.

PROGRAM

def sum_of_even_and_odd_numbers (n):
if n <= 0:
return "N should be a positive integer."

even_sum = 0
odd_sum = 0

for iin range(1, n+ 1):
if i%s2 ==
even_sum += i
else:

odd_sum += i
return even_sum, odd_sum

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
even_sum, odd_sum = sum_of_even_and_odd_numbers (n)

print ("Sum of even numbers from 1 to", n, , even_sum)
print ("Sum of odd numbers from 1 to", n, ":", odd_sum)
OUTPUT

//Output 01

Enter a positive integer: 10

Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 : 30
Sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10 : 25
