28.20. Consider the following set of two-dimensional records:

RID Dimension1 Dimension2
1 8 4
2 5 4
3 2 4
4 2 6
5 2 8
6 8 6

Also consider two different clustering schemes: (1) where Cluster, contains
records {1, 2, 3} and Cluster, contains records {4, 5, 6}, and (2) where Cluster,
contains records {1, 6} and Cluster contains records {2, 3, 4, 5}. Which scheme
is better and why?

28.21. Use the k-means algorithm to cluster the data from Exercise 28.20. We can
use a value of 3 for K, and we can assume that the records with RIDs 1, 3,
and 5 are used for the initial cluster centroids (means).

28.22. The k-means algorithm uses a similarity metric of distance between a record
and a cluster centroid. If the attributes of the records are not quantitative but
categorical in nature, such as Income_level with values {low, medium, high}
or Married with values {Yes, No} or State_of_residence with values {Alabama,
Alaska, ..., Wyoming}, then the distance metric is not meaningful. Define a
more suitable similarity metric that can be used for clustering data records
that contain categorical data.

Selected Bibliography

Literature on data mining comes from several fields, including statistics, mathe-
matical optimization, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Chen et al.
(1996) give a good summary of the database perspective on data mining. The book
by Han and Kamber (2006) is an excellent text and describes in detail the different
algorithms and techniques used in the data mining area. Work at IBM Almaden
Research has produced a large number of early concepts and algorithms as well as
results from some performance studies. Agrawal et al. (1993) report the first major
study on association rules. Their apriori algorithm for market-basket data in
Agrawal and Srikant (1994) is improved by using partitioning in Savasere et al.
(1995); Toivonen (1996) proposes sampling as a way to reduce the processing effort.
Cheung et al. (1996) extends the partitioning to distributed environments; Lin and
Dunham (1998) propose techniques to overcome problems with data skew. Agrawal
et al. (1993b) discuss the performance perspective on association rules. Mannila et
al. (1994), Park et al. (1995), and Amir et al. (1997) present additional efficient algo-
rithms related to association rules. Han et al. (2000) present the FP-tree algorithm
