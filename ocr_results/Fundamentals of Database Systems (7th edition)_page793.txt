20.5 Characterizing Schedules Based
on Serializability

In the previous section, we characterized schedules based on their recoverability
properties. Now we characterize the types of schedules that are always considered
to be correct when concurrent transactions are executing. Such schedules are known,
as serializable schedules. Suppose that two users—for example, two airline reserva-
tions agents—submit to the DBMS transactions T, and T) in Figure 20.2 at approx-
imately the same time. If no interleaving of operations is permitted, there are only
two possible outcomes:

1. Execute all the operations of transaction Tj (in sequence) followed by all the
operations of transaction T> (in sequence).

2. Execute all the operations of transaction T> (in sequence) followed by all the
operations of transaction T, (in sequence).

These two schedules—called serial schedules—are shown in Figures 20.5(a) and (b),
respectively. If interleaving of operations is allowed, there will be many possible
orders in which the system can execute the individual operations of the trans-
actions. Two possible schedules are shown in Figure 20.5(c). The concept of
serializability of schedules is used to identify which schedules are correct when
transaction executions have interleaving of their operations in the schedules. This
section defines serializability and discusses how it may be used in practice.

20.5.1 Serial, Nonserial, and Conflict-Serializable Schedules

Schedules A and B in Figures 20.5(a) and (b) are called serial because the operations
of each transaction are executed consecutively, without any interleaved operations
from the other transaction. In a serial schedule, entire transactions are performed
in serial order: T, and then T} in Figure 20.5(a), and T; and then T; in Figure 20.5(b).
Schedules C and D in Figure 20.5(c) are called nonserial because each sequence
interleaves operations from the two transactions.

Formally, a schedule S is serial if, for every transaction T participating in the sched-
ule, all the operations of T are executed consecutively in the schedule; otherwise, the
schedule is called nonserial. Therefore, in a serial schedule, only one transaction at a
time is active—the commit (or abort) of the active transaction initiates execution of
the next transaction. No interleaving occurs in a serial schedule. One reasonable
assumption we can make, if we consider the transactions to be independent, is that
every serial schedule is considered correct. We can assume this because every transac-
tion is assumed to be correct if executed on its own (according to the consistency
preservation property of Section 20.3). Hence, it does not matter which transaction is
executed first. As long as every transaction is executed from beginning to end in
isolation from the operations of other transactions, we get a correct end result.

The problem with serial schedules is that they limit concurrency by prohibiting
interleaving of operations. In a serial schedule, if a transaction waits for an I/O
