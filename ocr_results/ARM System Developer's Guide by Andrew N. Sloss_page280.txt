8.1 Representing a Digital Signal 267

EXAMPLE Suppose X[t] is a 16-bit signed representation for an audio signal x[t]. Suppose we need to
8.1 reduce the power of the signal by a half. To do this we must scale each sample by 1/(V2),
so ¢{t] = 2~°5 = 0.70710678....
Since we are using a 16-bit representation for X(t], a 16-bit multiply will suffice. The
largest power of two that we can multiply c[t] by and have it remain a 16-bit integer is 15.
So take n = d, m= 15, and C[¢] = 2!5/(/2) = 23,710 = 0x5A82. Therefore we can scale
using the integer operation

X[t] = (X[t] * 0x5A82) >> 15;

8.1.5 DIVISION OF FIXED-POINT SIGNALS

The general case is to convert the signal equation

x(t]
= 8.15
yit] Ty (8.15)
into fixed point format; that is, approximately:
24x{t] X(t]
Y(t] = 2¢y[t] = = dont 8.16
[¢] yt] ctl Cli (8.16)

or in integer C:

Y[t] = (X[t] <<(d-n+m)) / C[t];
Again a negative left shift indicates a right shift. You must take care that the left shift does
not cause an overflow. In typical applications, n = m. Then the preceding operation gives
a Qd result accurate to d places of binary fraction:

Y[t] = (x[t] <<d) / C[t];

See Section 7.3.3 for efficient implementations of fixed-point division.

8.1.6 SQUARE ROOT OF A FIXED-POINT SIGNAL

into fixed point format; that is, approximately:
