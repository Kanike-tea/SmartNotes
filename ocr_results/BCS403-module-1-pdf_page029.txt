Database Management System [BCS403]

The software components are distributed over two systems: client and server

= Server handles
- Query and transaction functionality related to SQL processing
= Client handles

- User interface programs and application programs

The user interface programs and application programs can run on the client side. When DBMS
access is required, the program establishes a connection to the DBMS(which is on the server side)

once the connection is created, the client program can communicate with the DBMS.

A client program can actually connect to several RDBMSs and send query and transaction requests
using the ODBC API, which are then processed at the server sites. Any query results are sent back
to the client program, which can process and display the results as needed. A related standard for
the Java programming language, called JDBC, has also been defined to allow Java client

programs to access one or more DBMSs through a standard interface

Object-oriented DBMSs
The different approach to two-tier client/server architecture was taken by some object-oriented
DBMSs, where the software modules of the DBMS were divided between client and server in a
more integrated way.
= server level
may include the part of the DBMS software responsible for handling data storage on disk
pages, local concurrency control and recovery, buffering and caching of disk pages.
= client level
may handle the user interface, data dictionary functions, DBMS _ interactions with
programming language compilers, global query optimization, concurrency control, and
recovery across multiple servers, structuring of complex objects from the data in the
buffers.
In this approach, the client/server interaction is more tightly coupled and is done internally by the
DBMS modules—some of which reside on the client and some on the server—rather than by the

users/programmers.

2.5.4 Three-Tier and n-Tier Architectures for Web Applications
Many Web applications use an architecture called the three-tier architecture, which adds an

intermediate layer between the client and the database server
