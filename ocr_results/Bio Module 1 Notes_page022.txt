Properties of Enzymes for Engineering Applications

Enzymes have several properties that make them ideal for engineering applications, including:

Specificity: Enzymes have a high level of specificity for the substrates they bind and
the reactions they catalyze, making them highly efficient at performing specific tasks.
Reactivity: Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions without being consumed
in the process, allowing them to perform multiple cycles of the same reaction.
Stability: Enzymes are generally stable at a wide range of temperatures and pH values,
making them useful in a variety of industrial processes.

Renewability: Enzymes are biodegradable and can be produced from renewable
resources, making them an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical
catalysts.

Cost-effectiveness: Enzymes can be produced in large quantities through
fermentation, making them a cost-effective alternative to synthetic catalysts in many

applications.

These properties make enzymes ideal for use in various industrial and engineering applications,

from bioremediation and biofuel production to food and beverage processing and textile

production.

Properties of Enzymes

A. Physical Properties

Macromolecular Nature: Enzymes are large protein molecules with a complex
three-dimensional structure.
Specificity: Each enzyme is highly specific to a particular substrate due to its unique

active site (Lock and Key model or Induced Fit model).
