Experimental error:

The unexplained random part of the variation in any experiment is termed as
experimental error. An estimate of experimental error can be obtained by replication.
Treatment design:

A treatment design is the manner in which the levels of treatments are arranged in an
experiment.

ANOVA:

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an analysis tool used in statistics that splits an observed
aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts: systematic factors and random factors.
The systematic factors have a statistical influence on the given data set, while the random factors do
not.

ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance. It is a statistical method used to analyze the
differences between the means of two or more groups or treatments. It is often used to determine
whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of different groups

There are two main types of ANOVA: one-way (or unidirectional) and two-way. There also
variations of ANOVA.

Real Life Applications of ANOVA:

e In social sciences, ANOVA tests can be used to study the statistical significance of various study
environments on test scores. Medical research. In medical research, the ANOVA test can be used
to identify the relationship between various types or brands of medications on individuals with
migraines or depression.

e We can use the ANOVA test to compare different suppliers and select the best available. ANOVA
(Analysis of Variance) is used when we have more than two sample groups and determine whether
there are any statistically significant differences between the means of two or more independent
sample groups.

CRD: A completely randomized design (CRD) is one where the treatments are assigned completely
at random so that each experimental unit has the same chance of receiving any one treatment.

RBD: A randomized block design is a restricted randomized design, in which experimental units are
first organized into homogeneous blocks and then the treatments are assigned at random to these units
