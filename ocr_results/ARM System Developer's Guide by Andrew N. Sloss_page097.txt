3.9 SUMMARY

In this chapter we covered the ARM instruction set. All ARM instructions are 32 bits in
length. The arithmetic, logical, comparisons, and move instructions can all use the inline
barrel shifter, which pre-processes the second register Rm before it enters into the ALU.

The ARM instruction set has three types of load-store instructions: single-register load-
store, multiple-register load-store, and swap. The multiple load-store instructions provide
the push-pop operations on the stack. The ARM-Thumb Procedure Call Standard (ATPCS)
defines the stack as being a full descending stack.

The software interrupt instruction causes a software interrupt that forces the processor
into SVC mode; this instruction invokes privileged operating system routines. The pro-
gram status register instructions write and read to the cpsr and spsr. There are also special
pseudoinstructions that optimize the loading of 32-bit constants.

The ARMySE extensions include count leading zeros, saturation, and improved multiply
instructions. The count leading zeros instruction counts the number of binary zeros before
integer
value. The improved multiply instructions provide better flexibility in multiplying 16-bit
values.

the first binary one. Saturation handles arithmetic calculations that overflow a 32-|

Most ARM instructions can be conditionally executed, which can dramatically reduce
the number of instructions required to perform a specific algorithm.
