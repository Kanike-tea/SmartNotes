Some database design tools are based on variations of the ER model that permit
only binary relationships. In this case, a ternary relationship such as SUPPLY must
be represented as a weak entity type, with no partial key and with three identifying
relationships. The three participating entity types SUPPLIER, PART, and PROJECT
are together the owner entity types (see Figure 3.17(c)). Hence, an entity in the
weak entity type SUPPLY in Figure 3.17(c) is identified by the combination of its
three owner entities from SUPPLIER, PART, and PROJECT.

It is also possible to represent the ternary relationship as a regular entity type by
introducing an artificial or surrogate key. In this example, a key attribute Supply_id
could be used for the supply entity type, converting it into a regular entity type.
Three binary N:1 relationships relate SUPPLY to each of the three participating
entity types.

Another example is shown in Figure 3.18. The ternary relationship type OFFERS
represents information on instructors offering courses during particular semesters;
hence it includes a relationship instance (i, s, c) whenever INSTRUCTOR i offers
COURSE c during SEMESTER s. The three binary relationship types shown in Fig-
ure 3.18 have the following meanings: CAN_TEACH relates a course to the instruc-
tors who can teach that course, TAUGHT_DURING relates a semester to the instructors
who taught some course during that semester, and OFFERED_DURING relates a
semester to the courses offered during that semester by any instructor. These ter-
nary and binary relationships represent different information, but certain
constraints should hold among the relationships. For example, a relationship
instance (i, s, c) should not exist in OFFERS unless an instance (i, s) exists in
TAUGHT_DURING, an instance (s, c) exists in OFFERED_DURING, and an instance
(i, c) exists in CAN_TEACH. However, the reverse is not always true;
we may have instances (i, s), (s, c), and (i, c) in the three binary relationship types
with no corresponding instance (i, s, c) in OFFERS. Note that in this example,
based on the meanings of the relationships, we can infer the instances of
TAUGHT_DURING and OFFERED_DURING from the instances in OFFERS, but
