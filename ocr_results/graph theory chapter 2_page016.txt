For a connected simple graph G with n vertices and m edges which has no
gules of length 3, show that m $ 2n— 4,
» Inthe given graph, every region must be bounded by four or more edges, so that the total
number of edges that bound all regions is greater than or equal to 4, where r is the number
of regions. On the other hand, an edge is in the boundary of at most two regions, Therefore,
the total number of edges that bound all regions is less than or equal to 2m, Thus, 4r $ 2m, or
< 2r, Substituting for r from the Euler's formula in this, we get

mez 2(m=n+2),) or ms 2n-4 .

Let G be a connected simple planar graph with n vertices, m edges and r re-
gions in which every region is bounded by at least k edges. Show that

>» Since every region in G is bounded by at least k edges, the total number of edges that bound
all the r regions is greater than or equal to kr. On the other hand, an edge is the boundary of
at most two regions. Therefore, the total number of edges that bound all regions is less than or
equal to 2m. Thus,

(ks, and Gi) ms

kr < 2m (i)
This proves the required result (i).
Substituting for r from the Euler’s formula in (i), we get
k(m—n+2) < 2m

k(n — 2)
a (k—2)m < k(n- 2), eg or ms ao

This proves the required result (ii). D .
Let G be a connected simple planar graph with fewer than 12 regions in which
each vertex has degree at least 3. Prove that G has a region bounded by at most four edges.
> Suppose every region in G is bounded b'at least 5 edges. Then, if G has.n vertices and m
edges, we should have (by result (i) of Example 13)

Sr<2m, ‘or m2 ($/2)r (i)

‘ Since each vertex has degree at least 3, the sum of the degrees of the vertices is greater than
“equal to 3n. By virtue of the handshaking property, this means that

2m > 3n or in < (2/3)m (ii)
