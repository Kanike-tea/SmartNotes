LECTURE-1: Introduction to Data

Introduction:

In computerized information system data are the basic resource of the organization. So, proper
organization and management for data is required for organization to run smoothly. Database
management system deals the knowledge of how data stored and managed on a computerized
information system. In any organization, it requires accurate and reliable data for better decision
making, ensuring privacy of data and controlling data efficiently.

The examples include deposit and/or withdrawal from a bank, hotel, airline or railway reservation,
purchase items from supermarkets in all cases, a database is accessed.

What is data?

Data are the known facts or figures that have implicit meaning. It can also be defined as it is the
representation of facts, concepts or instructions in a formal manner, which is suitable for
understanding and processing. Data can be represented in alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) and
using special characters (+,-.#,$, etc)

e.g: 25, “ajit” ete.

Information:

Information is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based. Information can be
defined as the organized and classified data to provide meaningful values.

Eg: “The age of Ravi is 25”

File:
File is a collection of related data stored in secondary memory.

File Oriented Approach:

The traditional file oriented approach to information processing each application has a separate
master file and its own set of personal file. In file oriented approach the program dependent on the
files and files dependent upon the programs.

Disadvantages of file oriented appro:
1) Data redundancy and inconsistency:

The same information may be written in several files. This redundancy leads to higher
storage and access cost. It may lead data inconsistency that is the various copies of the same
data may present at multiple places for example a changed customer address may be
reflected in single file but not else where in the system.

2) Difficulty in accessing data :
The conventional file processing system do not allow data to be retrieved in a convenient
and efficient manner according to user choice.

3) Data isolation :
Because data are scattered in various files and files may be in different formats with new

application programs to retrieve the appropriate data is difficult.

4) Integrity Problems:
