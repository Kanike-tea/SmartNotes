properly coloured. ;
By examining the first two graphs in Figure 2.37 which are properly coloured, we note "
(1) A graph can have more than one proper colouring.

(2) Two non-adjacent vertices in a properly coloured graph can have the same colour,

Chromatic Number
A graph G is said to be k-colourable if we can properly colour it with k (number of) colours.
A graph G which is k-colourable but not (k ~ 1)-colourable is called a k-chromatic graph.

In other words, a k-chromatic graph is a graph that can be properly coloured with & colours
but not with less than k colours,

If a graph G is k-chromatic, then k is called the chromatic number of G.
Thus, the chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colours with which the

graph can be properly coloured. =
‘omatic number of a graph G is usually denoted by y(G).
Some Results

The following results are direct consequences of the definition of the chromatic number

(1) A graph consisting of only isolated vertices (ie, Null graph) is 1-chromatic. (Bece**
no two vertices of such a graph are adjacen and therefore we can assign the same coe
to all vertices).

(2) A graph with One or more edges is at least 2-chromatic. (Because, such a graph bas #
least one pair of adjacent vertices which should have different colours).

(3) Ma graph G contains a graph Gy as a subgraph, then x(G) > 4(G)

(4) If G is a graph of n vertices, then X(G) <n,
