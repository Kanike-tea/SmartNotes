Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

= Storage and retrieval of videos, such as movies, and video clips from news
or personal digital cameras

= Data mining applications that analyze large amounts of data to search for
the occurrences of specific patterns or relationships, and for identifying
unusual patterns in areas such as credit card fraud detection

= Spatial applications that store and analyze spatial locations of data, such as
weather information, maps used in geographical information systems, and
automobile navigational systems

= Time series applications that store information such as economic data at
regular points in time, such as daily sales and monthly gross national
product figures

It was quickly apparent that basic relational systems were not very suitable for many
of these applications, usually for one or more of the following reasons:

= More complex data structures were needed for modeling the application
than the simple relational representation.

= New data types were needed in addition to the basic numeric and character
string types.

= New operations and query language constructs were necessary to manipu-
late the new data types.

= New storage and indexing structures were needed for efficient searching on
the new data types.

This led DBMS developers to add functionality to their systems. Some functionality
was general purpose, such as incorporating concepts from object-oriented data-
bases into relational systems. Other functionality was special purpose, in the form
of optional modules that could be used for specific applications. For example, users
could buy a time series module to use with their relational DBMS for their time
series application.

1.7.6 Emergence of Big Data Storage Systems
and NOSQL Databases

In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the proliferation of applications and
platforms such as social media Web sites, large e-commerce companies, Web search
indexes, and cloud storage/backup led to a surge in the amount of data stored on
large databases and massive servers. New types of database systems were necessary
to manage these huge databases—systems that would provide fast search and
retrieval as well as reliable and safe storage of nontraditional types of data, such as
social media posts and tweets. Some of the requirements of these new systems were
not compatible with SQL relational DBMSs (SQL is the standard data model and
language for relational databases). The term NOSQL is generally interpreted as Not
Only SQL, meaning that in systems than manage large amounts of data, some of the
data is stored using SQL systems, whereas other data would be stored using NOSQL,
depending on the application requirements.
