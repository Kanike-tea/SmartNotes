Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures

describes RAID (redundant arrays of inexpensive (or independent) disks)—a data
storage system architecture that is commonly used in large organizations for better
reliability and performance. Finally, in Section 16.11 we describe modern develop-
ments in the storage architectures that are important for storing enterprise data:
storage area networks (SANs), network-attached storage (NAS), iSCSI (Internet
SCSI—small computer system interface), and other network-based storage proto-
cols, which make storage area networks more affordable without the use of the
Fibre Channel infrastructure and hence are becoming widely accepted in industry.
We also discuss storage tiering and object-based storage. Section 16.12 summarizes
the chapter. In Chapter 17 we discuss techniques for creating auxiliary data struc-
tures, called indexes, which speed up the search for and retrieval of records. These
techniques involve storage of auxiliary data, called index files, in addition to the file
records themselves.

Chapters 16 and 17 may be browsed through or even omitted by readers who have
already studied file organizations and indexing in a separate course. The material
covered here, in particular Sections 16.1 through 16.8, is necessary for understand-
ing Chapters 18 and 19, which deal with query processing and optimization, as well
as database tuning for improving performance of queries.

16.1 Introduction

The collection of data that makes up a computerized database must be stored phys-
ically on some computer storage medium. The DBMS software can then retrieve,
update, and process this data as needed. Computer storage media form a storage
hierarchy that includes two main categories:

= Primary storage. This category includes storage media that can be operated
on directly by the computer's central processing unit (CPU), such as the
computer’s main memory and smaller but faster cache memories. Primary
storage usually provides fast access to data but is of limited storage capacity.
Although main memory capacities have been growing rapidly in recent
years, they are still more expensive and have less storage capacity than
demanded by typical enterprise-level databases. The contents of main mem-
ory are lost in case of power failure or a system crash.

= Secondary storage. The primary choice of storage medium for online stor-
age of enterprise databases has been magnetic disks. However, flash memo-
ries are becoming a common medium of choice for storing moderate
amounts of permanent data. When used as a substitute for a disk drive, such
memory is called a solid-state drive (SSD).

= Tertiary storage. Optical disks (CD-ROMs, DVDs, and other similar stor-
age media) and tapes are removable media used in today’s systems as offline
storage for archiving databases and hence come under the category called
tertiary storage. These devices usually have a larger capacity, cost less, and
provide slower access to data than do primary storage devices. Data in sec-
ondary or tertiary storage cannot be processed directly by the CPU; first it
must be copied into primary storage and then processed by the CPU.
