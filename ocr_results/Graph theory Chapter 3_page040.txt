The procedurs adopted in constructing a an imal tree shed above is move as

its leaves. For this purpose, v we first
“indicated earlier, Then all the vertices a
equences. The binary sequences through which the ledves‘are identified yield a prefix code
_ for the symbols representing these leaves. This prefix code i ‘is known as an optimal prefix code.
| For example, let us consider’ ‘the Huffman tree’ of Figure, 3. 46(vi) and assign the symbols
7 Oand 1 to its edges according to the usual pels mule ae resulting labeled tree is shown
