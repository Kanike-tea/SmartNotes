The size of the cells ranges between 10—100 jm in diameter.
This broad category involves plants, fungi, protozoans, and animals.

The plasma membrane is responsible for monitoring the transport of nutrients and

electrolyte in and out of the cells. It is also responsible for cell-to-cell communication.
They reproduce sexually as well as asexually.

There are some contrasting features between plant and animal cells. For e.g., the plant
cell contains chloroplast, central vacuoles, and other plastids, whereas the animal

cells do not.

Functions of Cell

A cell performs major functions essential for the growth and development of an organism.

Important functions of cell are as follows:

1.

Provides Support and Structure: All the organisms are made up of cells. They form
the structural basis of all the organisms. The cell wall and the cell membrane are the
main components that function to provide support and structure to the organism. For
eg., the skin is made up of a large number of cells. Xylem present in the vascular plants

is made of cells that provide structural support to the plants.

Facilitate Growth Mite

In the process of mitosis, the parent cell divides into the

daughter cells. Thus, the cells multiply and facilitate the growth in an organism.

Allows Transport of Substances: Various nutrients are imported by the cells to carry
out various chemical processes going on inside the cells. The waste produced by the
chemical processes is eliminated from the cells by active and passive transport. Small
molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and ethanol diffuse across the cell
membrane along the concentration gradient. This is known as passive transport. The
larger molecules diffuse across the cell membrane through active transport where the

cells require a lot of energy to transport the substances.

Energy Production: Cells require energy to carry out various chemical processes.
This energy is produced by the cells through a process called photosynthesis in plants

and respiration in animals.

Aids in Reproduction: A cell aids in reproduction through the processes called
