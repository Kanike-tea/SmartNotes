Since a & B are distinct roots of ],,(*) = 0 we have J,(%) =0& J. (B)=G
with the result the RHS of (4) becomes zero provided p -~@#0 or peta.

Thus we have proved that if o.# B

We shall now discuss the case when « = B

The RHS of (3) becomes an indeterminate form of the type when o = B.
We shall evaluate by taking limits on both sides as i >a, ne feering a fixed, by -
applying L’ Hospital's rule. - ;

Since a is fixed we must have J,(%) =0 as o is a root of J, (x) =0
