¢ Hyperloop Transportation: While not strictly an air-based mode of transportation, the
Hyperloop concept involves high-speed capsules traveling through low-pressure tubes,
offering near-supersonic speeds. This mode of transportation could connect distant cities
and regions in a fast, energy-efficient manner.

44 Lotus Leaf Effect:
Introduction

The lotus leaf effect, also known as the "lotus effect," refers to the ability of lotus leaves
to repel water and self-clean through their unique surface structure. This effect has inspired the
development of super hydrophobic and self-cleaning surfaces, which have a wide range of
applications in various industries.

The lotus leaf surface has a microscale and nanoscale structure that consists of
numerous small bumps and wax-coated hairs. This structure creates a high contact angle
between the water droplets and the surface, causing the droplets to roll off and carry away any
dirt or debris. This self-cleaning property is due to the lotus leaf's ability to repel water and

Super hydrophobic and self-cleaning surfaces have applications in industries such as
aerospace, automotive, building materials, and medical devices. For example, self-cleaning
