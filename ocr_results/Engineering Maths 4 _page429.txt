Stochastic Process onan

We have already stated that in a random experiment, if a real variable X is associated _ ‘

with every out come then it is called a random variable or stochastic variable. This is

equivalent to, having a function on the sample space S and this function is called a .

random function or a stochastic function. In this article we discuss a stochastic process
called the Markov process which is such that the generation of the probability
distributions depend only on the present state. Before we take up the actual discussion

of this Markov process we present some basic. definitions and concepts relating to

stochastic process.

e Classification of Stochastic Processes

Let S be the sample space of a random experiment and R be the set of all real numbers.

A random variable X is a function f from S$ to Rie, X = f(s),s.€ S.Wedefinean © *

index set T C Rindexed by the parameter t such as time. Let us suppose that the value
of a random variable defined on S depends ons € Sandt € T. In this context'a

Stochastic process is a set of random variables { X(t) te T} defined on S witha, _

parameter t. Here X) = X(0) iscalled as the initial state of the system.

The values assumed by the random variable X () are called states and the set of all. .

possible values forms the state space of the process. If the state space of a stochastic
process is discrete then it is called a discrete state process also called a chain.

On the other hand if the state space is continuous then the stochastic process is called . 8

a continuous state process.

Similarly if the index set T is discrete then we have a discrete parameter process. °

Otherwise (i.e, when T is a continuous set) we have a continuous parameter process.

A discrete parameter process is also called a stochastic sequence denoted by * ~
