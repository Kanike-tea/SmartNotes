= Part 10 (Chapters 23, 24, and 25) includes the chapter on distributed data-
bases (Chapter 23), plus the two new chapters on NOSQL storage systems
for big data (Chapter 24) and big data technologies based on Hadoop and
MapReduce (Chapter 25). Chapter 23 introduces distributed database
concepts, including availability and scalability, replication and fragmenta-
tion of data, maintaining data consistency among replicas, and many other
concepts and techniques. In Chapter 24, NOSQL systems are categorized
into four general categories with an example system in each category used
for our examples, and the data models, operations, as well as the replica-
tion/distribution/scalability strategies of each type of NOSQL system are
discussed and compared. In Chapter 25, the MapReduce programming
model for distributed processing of big data is introduced, and then we
have presentations of the Hadoop system and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed
File System), as well as the Pig and Hive high-level interfaces, and the
YARN architecture.

= Part 11 (Chapters 26 through 29) is entitled Advanced Database Models,
Systems, and Applications and includes the following materials: Chapter 26
introduces several advanced data models including active data-
bases/triggers (Section 26.1), temporal databases (Section 26.2), spatial data-
bases (Section 26.3), multimedia databases (Section 26.4), and deductive
databases (Section 26.5). Chapter 27 discusses information retrieval (IR)
and Web search, and includes topics such as IR and keyword-based search,
comparing DB with IR, retrieval models, search evaluation, and ranking
algorithms. Chapter 28 is an introduction to data mining including over-
views of various data mining methods such as associate rule mining, cluster-
ing, classification, and sequential pattern discovery. Chapter 29 is an
overview of data warehousing including topics such as data warehousing
models and operations, and the process of building a data warehouse.

= Part 12 (Chapter 30) includes one chapter on database security, which
includes a discussion of SQL commands for discretionary access control
(GRANT, REVOKE), as well as mandatory security levels and models for
including mandatory access control in relational databases, and a discussion
of threats such as SQL injection attacks, as well as other techniques and
methods related to data security and privacy.

Appendix A gives a number of alternative diagrammatic notations for displaying a
conceptual ER or EER schema. These may be substituted for the notation we use, if
the instructor prefers. Appendix B gives some important physical parameters of
disks. Appendix C gives an overview of the QBE graphical query language, and
Appendixes D and E (available on the book’s Companion Website located at
http://www.pearsonhighered.com/elmasri) cover legacy database systems, based on
the hierarchical and network database models. They have been used for more than
thirty years as a basis for many commercial database applications and transaction-
processing systems.
