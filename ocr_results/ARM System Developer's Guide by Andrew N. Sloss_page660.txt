APPENDIX

PROCESSORS AND
ARCHITECTURE

This appendix lists ARM processor names together with their core name and Instruction
Set Architecture (ISA). We have omitted processors designed prior to the ARM7TDMI.

For example, Table C.3 shows that the ARM966E-S processor has a ARME core and
implements ARM architecture version 5TE. Any ARMVSTE binaries will execute on an
ARM966E-S processor.

C.1 ARM NAMING CONVENTION

All ARM processors share a common naming convention that has evolved over time. ARM.
cores have the name ARM{x}{labels}, where x is the number of the core and labels are
letters representing extra features, described in Table C.1. ARM processors have the name
ARM{x}{y}{z}{labels}, where y and z are numbers defining the processor cache size and
memory management model. Table C.2 lists the rules for ARM processor numbering.

The labels, or attributes, are often subsumed into the architecture version over time.
For example, the T label indicates the inclusion of Thumb in ARMv4 processors. However,
Thumb is included in ARMv5 and later processors, so it is not necessary to specify the T
after this point.

C.2 CORE AND ARCHITECTURES

Table C.3 shows each ARM processor together with the core and architecture versions that
the processor uses.
