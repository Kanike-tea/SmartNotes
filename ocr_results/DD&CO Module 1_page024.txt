NOR Implementation

The NOR operation is the dual of the NAND operation. Therefore, all procedures and rules for NOR
logic are the duals of the corresponding procedures and rules developed for NAND logic. The NOR gate
is another universal gate that can be used to implement any Boolean function. The implementation of
the complement, OR, and AND operations with NOR gates is shown in Fig. The complement operation
is obtained from a oneLlinput NOR gate that behaves exactly like an inverter. The OR operation requires

two NOR gates, and the AND operation is obtained with a NOR gate that has inverters in each input.

OR ‘—) > [>o x+y
: ——_>o—

The two graphic symbols for the mixed notation are shown in Fig. The OR-invert symbol defines the

NOR operation as an OR followed by a complement. The invert-AND symbol complements each input

and then performs an AND operation. The two symbols designate the same NOR operation and are
logically identical because of DeMorgan’s theorem.

A two-level implementation with NOR gates requires that the function be simplified into product-of-
sums form. Remember that the simplified product-of-sums expression is obtained from the map by
combining the 0’s and complementing. A product-of-sums expression is implemented with a first level
of OR gates that produce the sum terms followed by a second-level AND gate to produce the product.
The transformation from the OR-AND diagram to a NOR diagram is achieved by changing the OR gates
to NOR gates with OR-invert graphic symbols and the AND gate to a NOR gate with an invert-AND
graphic symbol. A single literal term going into the second-level gate must be complemented. Fig shows

the NOR implementation of a function expressed as a product of sums:

F=(A+B)(C+D)E
