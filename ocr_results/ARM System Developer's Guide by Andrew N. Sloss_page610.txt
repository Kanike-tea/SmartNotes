A.3 Alphabetical List of ARM and Thumb Instructions 597

This instruction does not affect the processor registers (other than advancing pc). It merely
hints that the programmer is likely to read from the given address in future. A cached
processor may take this as a hint to load the cache line containing the address into the
cache. The instruction should not generate a data abort or any other memory system error.
If Rn is pe, then the value used for Rn is the address of the instruction plus eight. Rm
must not be pe.

Examples

PLD [r0, #7] 3 Preload from r0+7
PLD [r0, rl, LSL#2] 3 Preload from r0+4*r1

POP Pops multiple registers from the stack in Thumb state (for ARM state use LDM)
1. POP <regster_list> THUMBv 1
Action

1. equivalent to the ARM instruction LDMFD sp!, <register_list>

The <register_list> can contain registers in the range r0 to r7 and pc. The following
example restores the low-numbered ARM registers and returns from a subroutine:

POP {r0-r7,pc}

PUSH Pushes multiple registers to the stack in Thumb state (for ARM state use STM)
1. PUSH <regster_list> THUMBv 1
Action

1. equivalent to the ARM instruction STMFD sp!, <register_list>

The <register_]ist> can contain registers in the range r0 to r7 and Ir. The following
example saves the low-numbered ARM registers and link register.

PUSH {r0-r7,1r}

QADD Saturated signed and unsigned arithmetic

QDADD

QDSUB 1. QADD<cond> Rd, Rm, Rn ARMV5E.
QSUB

2.  QDADD<cond> Rd, Rm, Rn ARMv5E.
