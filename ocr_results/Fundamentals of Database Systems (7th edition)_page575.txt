the rise and costs are declining. Soon the term very large database may be reserved
for databases containing hundreds of terabytes or petabytes.

To summarize, a hierarchy of storage devices and storage systems is available today
for storage of data. Depending upon the intended use and application requirements,
data is kept in one or more levels of this hierarchy. Table 16.1 summarizes the cur-
rent state of these devices and systems and shows the range of capacities, average
access times, bandwidths (transfer speeds), and costs on the open commodity mar-
ket. Cost of storage is generally going down at all levels of this hierarchy.

16.1.2 Storage Organization of Databases

Databases typically store large amounts of data that must persist over long periods
of time, and hence the data is often referred to as persistent data. Parts of this data
are accessed and processed repeatedly during the storage period. This contrasts
with the notion of transient data, which persists for only a limited time during
program execution. Most databases are stored permanently (or persistently) on
magnetic disk secondary storage, for the following reasons:

= Generally, databases are too large to fit entirely in main memory.*

= The circumstances that cause permanent loss of stored data arise less fre-
quently for disk secondary storage than for primary storage. Hence, we refer
to disk—and other secondary storage devices—as nonvolatile storage,
whereas main memory is often called volatile storage.

= The cost of storage per unit of data is an order of magnitude less for disk
secondary storage than for primary storage.

“This statement is being challenged by recent developments in main memory database systems.
