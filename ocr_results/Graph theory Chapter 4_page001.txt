We observe that the weights of these three spanning trees are 16, 13-and 15 respectively.
Of these trees, the second one has the minimum weight. This is a minimal spanning tree for
the graph in Figure 4.1.

so There are several methods of constructing minimal spanning -trees..,,Below. we-give the
Working Rules (algorithms) of two of such methods. The first of these is-due to Kruskal, and
the second is due to Prim.

(l) Kruskal’s Algorithm

The Working Rule for the Kruskal’s method (usually called Kruskal ’s algorithm) may be
Slated as follows. vig tenable :

u ‘Of non-decreasing weights. «yooh: o/s

Step 1. Given a connected, weighted graph G:with'n vertices, list the edges.of:G in the order

2. Staring with a smallest weighted edge, proceed sequentially by selecting one edge at
4 time such that no cycle is formed.“ : LEASE Ah AOR, NTS
