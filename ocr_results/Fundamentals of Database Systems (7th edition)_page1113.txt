28.2 Association Rules

One approach to handling a quantitative attribute is to partition its values into non-
overlapping intervals that are assigned labels. This can be done in a static manner
based on domain-specific knowledge. For example, a concept hierarchy may group
values for Salary into three distinct classes: low income (0 < Salary < 29,999), middle
income (30,000 < Salary < 74,999), and high income (Salary > 75,000). From here,
the typical apriori-type algorithm or one of its variants can be used for the rule min-
ing since the quantitative attributes now look like categorical attributes. Another
approach to partitioning is to group attribute values based on data distribution (for
example, equi-depth partitioning) and to assign integer values to each partition.
The partitioning at this stage may be relatively fine, that is, a larger number of inter-
vals. Then during the mining process, these partitions may combine with other
adjacent partitions if their support is less than some predefined maximum value.
An apriori-type algorithm can be used here as well for the data mining.

Negative Associations. The problem of discovering a negative association is
harder than that of discovering a positive association. A negative association is of
the following type: 60% of customers who buy potato chips do not buy bottled water.
(Here, the 60% refers to the confidence for the negative association rule.) In a data-
base with 10,000 items, there are 210,000 possible combinations of items, a majority
of which do not appear even once in the database. If the absence of a certain item
combination is taken to mean a negative association, then we potentially have mil-
lions and millions of negative association rules with RHSs that are of no interest at
all. The problem, then, is to find only interesting negative rules. In general, we are
interested in cases in which two specific sets of items appear very rarely in the same
transaction. This poses two problems.

1. For a total item inventory of 10,000 items, the probability of any two being
bought together is (1/10,000) * (1/10,000) = 10°®. If we find the actual sup-
port for these two occurring together to be zero, that does not represent a
significant departure from expectation and hence is not an interesting (neg-
ative) association.

2. The other problem is more serious. We are looking for item combinations
with very low support, and there are millions and millions with low or even
zero support. For example, a data set of 10 million transactions has most of
the 2.5 billion pairwise combinations of 10,000 items missing. This would
generate billions of useless rules.

Therefore, to make negative association rules interesting, we must use prior knowl-
edge about the itemsets. One approach is to use hierarchies. Suppose we use the
hierarchies of soft drinks and chips shown in Figure 28.4.
