Advantages of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers
Increased oxygen-carrying capacity:

HBOCs can potentially carry more oxygen per unit volume than whole blood.
This can be advantageous in situations where there is a need for rapid oxygen delivery or
when there is limited availability of blood for transfusion.

Universal compatibility:

Unlike blood transfusions, which require blood typing and cross-matching to ensure
compatibility, HBOCs can potentially be universally compatible with any blood type.
This canbe particularly useful in emergency situations or in areas where blood matching
facilities are limited.

Longer shelf life:

HBOCs have the potential for longer storage and shelf life compared to
donated blood, which has a limited lifespan. This can improve the availability of
oxygen-carrying substitutes in critical situations and reduce the need for frequent
blood donations.

Reduced risk of infections:

Blood transfusions carry a small risk of transmitting infections, such as viruses or
bacteria, from the donor to the recipient. Since HBOCs are synthetic and do not rely on
human donors, the risk of infections associated with transfusion can be significantly
reduced.

Availability in remote or challenging settings:
In remote or underdeveloped areas where access to safe blood transfusions
may be limited, HBOCs can potentially provide a viable alternative for oxygen
delivery. This can be particularly beneficial in military settings, disaster relief

efforts, or during transport of patients where immediate access to blood is not
feasible.

Limitations/Risks of using HBOCs
Limited oxygen release:

One of the challenges with HBOCs is ensuring efficient oxygen release to
the tissues. The oxygen dissociation curve of HBOCs may differ from that of
natural red blood cells, potentially leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues
in certain conditions.

Short half-life:

HBOCs tend to have a shorter half-life in the body compared to natural red blood
cells. This means that the HBOCs may be rapidly cleared from circulation, reducing their
effectiveness and requiring more frequent doses or infusions.
