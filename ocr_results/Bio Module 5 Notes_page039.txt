substrate. When odor molecules interact with the sensor surface, they cause changes in the wave
propagation, resulting in measurable frequency shifts. SAW sensors offer high sensitivity and
fast response times.

Optical Sensors:

Optical sensors employ various principles such as absorbance, luminescence, or
refractive index changes to detect and analyze odor molecules. These sensors can_ utilize
techniques like colorimetry, fluorescence, or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to provide
information about the chemical properties of the detected odors.

Gas Chromatography (GC) Sensors:

GC-based electronic noses combine gas chromatography with sensor arrays to separate
and detect different odor compounds. The separation is performed using a column, and the eluted
compounds are detected by sensor elements, enabling the identification of specific odor
components.

Materials Used in Electrical Nose Technology
Examples of biomaterials used in Electrical Nose technology include:

e Polymers: Polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), are often used as the matrix or
substrate material in electrical nose sensors, as they are flexible and have a high sensitivity
to volatile organic compounds.

e Carbon Nanotubes: Carbon nanotubes are small tubes made of carbon atoms that have high
electrical conductivity and sensitivity to volatile organic compounds, making them an
attractive material for use in electrical nose sensors.

e Metal Oxides: Metal oxides, such as tin oxide (SnOz) or zinc oxide (ZnO), are commonly
used in electrical nose sensors because of their high sensitivity to volatile organic
compounds and ability to undergo changes in electrical conductivity in response to different
aroma compounds.

e Dendrime:

: Dendrimers are synthetic, branched nanostructures that can be functionalized
with specific receptors or enzymes to target specific aroma compounds. They are being
explored as potential materials for use in electrical nose sensors.

e Microfluidic Devices: Microfluidic devices, which are small devices that can manipulate
small volumes of fluid, are being used in the development of electrical nose sensors. These
devices can be made from a variety of materials, including silicon, glass, and polymers, and
can be functionalized with specific receptors or enzymes to target specific aroma
compounds.
