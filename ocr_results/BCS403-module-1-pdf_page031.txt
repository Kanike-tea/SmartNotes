Database Management System [BCS403]

- displays information to the user and allows data entry
= The business logic layer
- handles intermediate rules and constraints before data is passed up to the user or down
to the DBMS
- can also act as a Web server, which retrieves query results from the database server and
formats them into dynamic Web pages that are viewed by the Web browser at the client
side
= The bottom layer
- includes all data management services

2.5.5 N-tier Architecture

It is possible to divide the layers between the user and the stored data further into finer
components, thereby giving rise to n-tier architectures; where n may be four or five tiers. The
business logic layer is divided into multiple layers
= Advantage

- any one tier can run on an appropriate processor or operating system platform and can be

handled independently.

Vendors of ERP (enterprise resource planning) and CRM (customer relationship management)
packages often use a middleware layer, which accounts for the front-end modules (clients)

communicating witha number of back-end databases (servers).

2.6 Classification of Database Management Systems

Criteria used to classify DBMSs are
1. Data model on which the DBMS is based
= Relational: represents a database as a collection of tables, where each table can be
stored as a separate file.
= Object: defines a database in terms of objects, their properties, and their operations.
Objects with the same structure and behavior belong to a class, and classes are
organized into hierarchies (or acyclic graphs). The operations of each class are
specified in terms of predefined procedures called methods.
= Hierarchical and network (legacy): The network model represents data as record

types and also represents a limited type of 1:N relationship, called a set type. The
