1.8 Euler circuits and Euler trails

Consider a connected graph G. If there is a circuit in G that contains all the edges of G, then
that circuit is agg an Euler circuit (or Eulerian line, or Euler tour) in G. Vf there is a trail
in G that contains all the edges of G, then that trail is called an Euler trail (or unicursal line)
inG.

Recall that in a trail and a circuit no edge can appear more than once but a vertex can appear
more than once. This property is carried to Euler trails and Eular circuits also.

Since Euler circuits and Euler trails include all edges, they automatically should include all
vertices as well.

A connected graph that contains an Euler circuit is called an Euler graph (or Eulerian
graph).

A connected graph that contains an Euler trail is called a semi-Euler graph (or a semi-
Eulerian graph or unicursal graph).

onsider the graph shown in Figure 1.120. We observe that, in this graph, every sequence
¢s which starts and ends with the same vertex and which includes all edges will contain
st one repeated edge. Thus, this graph has no Eular circuits. Hence this graph is not an
Braph.

Imay be seen that in the graph in Figure 1.120 the trail Ae BexDe3CegAesD is an Euler
‘This graph is therefore a semi-Euler graph.
