2.1. Data Models, Schemas, and Instances

We call each object in the schema—such as STUDENT or COURSE—a schema
construct.

A schema diagram displays only some aspects of a schema, such as the names of
record types and data items, and some types of constraints. Other aspects are not
specified in the schema diagram; for example, Figure 2.1 shows neither the data
type of each data item nor the relationships among the various files. Many types of
constraints are not represented in schema diagrams. A constraint such as students
majoring in computer science must take CS1310 before the end of their sophomore
year is quite difficult to represent diagrammatically.

The actual data in a database may change quite frequently. For example, the data-
base shown in Figure 1.2 changes every time we add a new student or enter a new
grade. The data in the database at a particular moment in time is called a database
state or snapshot. It is also called the current set of occurrences or instances in
the database. In a given database state, each schema construct has its own current
set of instances; for example, the STUDENT construct will contain the set of indi-
vidual student entities (records) as its instances. Many database states can be con-
structed to correspond to a particular database schema. Every time we insert or
delete a record or change the value of a data item in a record, we change one state
of the database into another state.

The distinction between database schema and database state is very important.
When we define a new database, we specify its database schema only to the
DBMS. At this point, the corresponding database state is the empty state with
no data. We get the initial state of the database when the database is first
populated or loaded with the initial data. From then on, every time an update
operation is applied to the database, we get another database state. At any point
in time, the database has a current state.* The DBMS is partly responsible for
ensuring that every state of the database is a valid state—that is, a state that
satisfies the structure and constraints specified in the schema. Hence, specify-
ing a correct schema to the DBMS is extremely important and the schema must
be designed with utmost care. The DBMS stores the descriptions of the schema
constructs and constraints—also called the meta-data—in the DBMS catalog so
that DBMS software can refer to the schema whenever it needs to. The schema
is sometimes called the intension, and a database state is called an extension of
the schema.

Although, as mentioned earlier, the schema is not supposed to change frequently,
it is not uncommon that changes occasionally need to be applied to the schema as
the application requirements change. For example, we may decide that another
data item needs to be stored for each record ina file, such as adding the Date_of_birth
to the STUDENT schema in Figure 2.1. This is known as schema evolution. Most
modern DBMSs include some operations for schema evolution that can be applied
while the database is operational.

®The current state is also called the current snapshot of the database. It has also been called a database
instance, but we prefer to use the term instance to refer to individual records.
