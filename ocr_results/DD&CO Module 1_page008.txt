Extension to Multiple Inputs

The gates shown in above Fig. except for the inverter and buffer - can be extended to have more than
two inputs. A gate can be extended to have multiple inputs if the binary operation it represents is
commutative and associative. The AND and OR operations, defined in Boolean algebra, possess these
two properties. For the OR function, we have
x+y=y+x (commutative)

and

(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)=x+y+z (associative)
which indicates that the gate inputs can be interchanged and that the OR function can be extended to
three or more variables.
To overcome this difficulty, we define the multiple NOR (or NAND) gate as a complemented OR (or

AND) gate.

The graphic symbols for the three-input gates are shown in Fig. In writing cascaded NOR and NAND
operations, one must use the correct parentheses to signify the proper sequence of the gates. To
demonstrate this principle, consider the circuit of Fig. The Boolean function for the circuit must be

written as F = [(ABC) ' (DE) ']'= ABC + DE

D> F = [(ABC)' : (DE)']’ = ABC + DE

Positive and Negative Logic

Qw>

The binary signal at the inputs and outputs of any gate has one of two values, except during transition.
One signal value represents logic 1 and the other logic 0. Since two signal values are assigned to two
logic values, there exist two different assignments of signal level to logic value, as shown in Figure. The
higher signal level is designated by H and the lower signal level by L. Choosing the high-level H to
represent logic 1 defines a positive logic system. Choosing the low-level L to represent logic 1

defines a negative logic system.
