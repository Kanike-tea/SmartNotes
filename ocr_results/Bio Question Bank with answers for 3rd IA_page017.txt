Human blood substitutes should be stable and capable of being stored and transported easily.
This is particularly important in emergency situations or areas where access to blood products
may be limited. The ability to store and transport substitutes effectively ensures their
availability when needed.

Cost-Effectiveness and Scalability:

Blood substitutes should be cost-effective and scalable for widespread use in medical settings.
They should be affordable and feasible to produce in large quantities, meeting the potential
demand for blood products.

Types of HBS

There are two types of human blood substitutes - hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs)
and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

HBOCs are based on the hemoglobin molecule, which is the protein in red blood cells that
carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Hemoglobin is extracted from human or animal blood and
then modified to create a stable, synthetic version. When introduced into the body, HBOCs can
help to increase the amount of oxygen available to the tissues, which can be important in
situations where the body is unable to produce or transport enough red blood cells.

PFCs are synthetic molecules that are similar in structure to the hemoglobin molecule.
However, unlike HBOCs, they do not require modification from natural sources. PFCs are able
to dissolve oxygen and transport it throughout the body, similar to the way that red blood cells
work.

13. What is Bioimaging? Discuss the process and applications of bioimaging.

Bio-imaging is the use of imaging technologies to visualize biological processes and
structures in living organisms. It plays a crucial role in disease diagnosis by providing
detailed images of the body's internal structures and functions, and can help healthcare
professionals to identify and diagnose a wide range of diseases and conditions.

Examples of Bioimaging Techniques

Some examples of bioimaging techniques used for disease diagnosis include X-rays,
CT scans, MRI, PET scans, ultrasound, and optical imaging. These technologies can be used
to visualize a wide range of structures and functions, including bones, tissues, organs, blood
vessels, and more.
