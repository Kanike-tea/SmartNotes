5) A student’s study habits are as follows. If he studies one night, he is 30% sure to study the next
night. On the other hand, if he does not study one night, he is 40% sure to study the next night.
Find the transition matrix for the chain of his study.

Sol": We have two possible states
a,= Studying a,=Not studying
Therefore, given that
P11 =Probability of studying on night, given that he has studied in the previous night=30%=0.3
Piz =Probability of not studying on night, given that-he has studied the previous night=70%=0.7
P21 =Probability of studying on night, given that he has not studied the previous night=40%=0.4
P22 =Probability of not studying on night, given that he has not studied the previous night=60%=0.6

Accordingly, the transition matrix of the chain of study is P = Pe | = Re qe
Let the unique probability vector Q = [x yy] for which @P = Q

of lo ool = 7

=> [0.3x+0.4y 0.7x+0.6y]=[x y]

=> 0.3x + 0.4y = x,0.7x + 0.6y = y

=> 0.7x —0.4y =0

> 0.7x -0.4(1— x) =0

=>11x-04=0

Thus, we conclude that in the long run the student will study = of the time or 36.36 % of the time.

6) A software engineer goes to his work-place every day by motor bike or by car. He never goes by a
bike on two consecutive days; but if he goes by car on a day then he is equally likely to go by car
or bike on the next day. Find the transition matrix for the chain of the mode of transport he uses.
If car is used on the first day of a week, find the probability that, (i) Bike is used, (ii) Car is used
on the fifth day.

Sol": Given the Markov chain of the mode of transport has the following two states:

a,= Using bike a,=Using car
And to find,
