Digital Design &Computer Organization(BCS302) Module -4

The following steps takes place when the interrupt related instruction is
executed:

e It suspends the execution of current instruction i.
e Transfer the execution control to sub program from main program.
e Increments the content of PC by 4 memory location.

e It decrements SP by 4 memory locations.

e Pushes the contents of PC into the stack segment memory whose address is
stored in SP.

e It loads PC with the address of the first instruction of the sub program.

The following steps takes place when ‘return’ instruction is executed in ISR -
e It transfers the execution control from ISR to user program.

e It retrieves the content of stack memory location whose address is stored in SP
into the PC.

e After retrieving the return address from stack memory location into the PC
it increments theContent of SP by 4 memory location.
Interrupt Latency / interrupt response time is the delay between the time
taken for receiving aninterrupt request and start of the execution of the ISR.

Generally, the long interrupt latency is unacceptable.

e The external device (I/O device) sends interrupt request to the processor by
activating a bus lineand called as interrupt request line.
e All1/O device uses the same single interrupt-request line.

e¢ One end of this interrupt request line is connected to input power supply by
means of a register.

e The another end of interrupt request line is connected to INTR (Interrupt

request) signal ofprocessor as shown in the fig.
