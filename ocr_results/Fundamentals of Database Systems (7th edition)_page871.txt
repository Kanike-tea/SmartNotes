Distributed Database Concepts

n this chapter, we turn our attention to distributed

databases (DDBs), distributed database management
systems (DDBMSs), and how the client-server architecture is used as a platform for
database application development. Distributed databases bring the advantages of
distributed computing to the database domain. A distributed computing system
consists of a number of processing sites or nodes that are interconnected by a com-
puter network and that cooperate in performing certain assigned tasks. As a general
goal, distributed computing systems partition a big, unmanageable problem into
smaller pieces and solve it efficiently in a coordinated manner. Thus, more comput-
ing power is harnessed to solve a complex task, and the autonomous processing
nodes can be managed independently while they cooperate to provide the needed
functionalities to solve the problem. DDB technology resulted from a merger of two
technologies: database technology and distributed systems technology.

Several distributed database prototype systems were developed in the 1980s and
1990s to address the issues of data distribution, data replication, distributed query
and transaction processing, distributed database metadata management, and other
topics. More recently, many new technologies have emerged that combine distrib-
uted and database technologies. These technologies and systems are being devel-
oped for dealing with the storage, analysis, and mining of the vast amounts of data
that are being produced and collected, and they are referred to generally as big data
technologies. The origins of big data technologies come from distributed systems
and database systems, as well as data mining and machine learning algorithms that
can process these vast amounts of data to extract needed knowledge.

In this chapter, we discuss the concepts that are central to data distribution and the
management of distributed data. Then in the following two chapters, we give an
overview of some of the new technologies that have emerged to manage and process
big data. Chapter 24 discusses the new class of database systems known as NOSQL
