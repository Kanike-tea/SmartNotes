Deletion
“+ In SQL we can delete only whole tuple and not the values on any particular
attributes. The command is as follows:

delete from r where P.
where P is a predicate and r is a relation.
“delete command operates on only one relation at a time. Examples are as follows:
* Delete all tuples from the Loan relation
delete from Loan
o Delete all of the Smith’s account record
delete from Depositor
where customer-name = “Smith”
o Delete all loans with loan amounts between Rs 1300 and Rs 1500.
delete from Loan
where amount between 1300 and 1500
o Delete the records of all accounts with balances below the average at the bank
delete from Account
where balance < ( select avg(balance)
from Account)

Insertion

In SQL we either specify a tuple to be inserted or write a query whose result is a
set of tuples to be inserted. Examples are as follows:

Insert an account of account number A-9732 at the Sadar branch having balance
of Rs 1200

insert into Account

values(“Sadar”, “A-9732”, 1200)

the values are specified in the order in which the corresponding attributes are
listed in the relation schema.

SQL allows the attributes to be specified as part of the insert statement

insert into Account(account-number, branch-name, balance)

values(“A-9732”, “Sadar”, 1200)

insert into Account(branch-name, account-number, balance)
