Advantages of Sonar Technology

Versatility: Sonar technology is versatile and can be used in a variety of applications,
such as underwater navigation, mapping, and imaging, as well as for military and
scientific purposes.

Cost-effective: Compared to other underwater imaging technologies, sonar is relatively
cost-effective and affordable.

Non-invasive: Unlike other imaging technologies, such as diving and remote-operated
vehicles, sonar does not physically disturb the underwater environment, making it an
ideal choice for environmental monitoring and scientific research.

Real-time imaging: Sonar provides real-time imaging, allowing operators to quickly and
easily assess the underwater environment.

High resolution: Modern sonar systems have high-resolution capabilities, allowing for
detailed images of underwater objects and structures.

Limitations of Sonar Technology

Limited visibility: Sonar imaging is limited by the visibility of the water, which can be
affected by factors such as sediment, algae, and water temperature. This can make it
difficult to obtain clear and accurate images.

Interference: Sonar signals can be affected by interference from other underwater
sources, such as ships, submarines, and natural underwater features, which can lead to
false readings and reduced accuracy.

Short range: Sonar signals have a limited range, which can make it difficult to image
larger underwater structures or objects that are located far away from the sonar system.

Limited depth: The depth to which sonar can effectively penetrate is limited, making it
unsuitable for imaging objects or structures that are located at great depths.
