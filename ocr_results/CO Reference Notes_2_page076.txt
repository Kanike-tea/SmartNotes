SINGLE BUS ORGANIZATION

ALU and all the registers are interconnected via a Single Common Bus (Figure 7.1).
Data & address lines of the external memory-bus is connected to the internal processor-bus via MDR &
MAR respectively. (MDR= Memory Data Register, MAR = Memory Address Register).
e MDR has 2 inputs and 2 outputs. Data may be loaded
— into MDR either from memory-bus (external) or
— from processor-bus (internal).
e MAR's input is connected to internal-bus; MAR‘s output is connected to external- bus.

¢ Instruction Decoder & Control Unit is responsible for

— issuing the control-signals to all the units inside the processor.

— implementing the actions specified by the instruction (loaded in the IR).
* Register RO through R(n-1) are the Processor Registers.

The programmer can access these registers for general-purpose use.
. Only processor can access 3 registers Y, Z & Temp for temporary storage during program-

execution. The programmer cannot access these 3 registers.
eInALU, — 1),,A“ input gets the operand from the output of the multiplexer(MUX).

2) ,,B" input gets the operand directly from the processor-bus.

© There are 2 options provided for ,,A“ input of the ALU.
* MUX is used to select one of the 2 inputs.
* MUX selects either

— output of Y or
