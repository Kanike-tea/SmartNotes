cream

cream-brand ice cream => wine cooler may produce enough confidence and sup-
port to be valid association rules of interest.

Therefore, if the application area has a natural classification of the itemsets into
hierarchies, discovering associations within the hierarchies is of no particular inter-
est. The ones of specific interest are associations across hierarchies. They may occur
among item groupings at different levels.

Multidimensional Associations. Discovering association rules involves search-
ing for patterns in a file. In Figure 28.1, we have an example of a file of customer
transactions with three dimensions: Transaction_id, Time, and Items_bought.
However, our data mining tasks and algorithms introduced up to this point only
involve one dimension: Items_bought. The following rule is an example of includ-
ing the label of the single dimension: Items_bought(milk) => Items_bought(juice).
It may be of interest to find association rules that involve multiple dimensions, for
example, Time(6:30 ... 8:00) => Items_bought(milk). Rules like these are called
multidimensional association rules. The dimensions represent attributes of records
of a file or, in terms of relations, columns of rows of a relation, and can be categori-
cal or quantitative. Categorical attributes have a finite set of values that display no
ordering relationship. Quantitative attributes are numeric and their values display
an ordering relationship, for example, <. Items_bought is an example of a categori-
cal attribute and Transaction_id and Time are quantitative.
