Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

© Association rules. In the context of Web usage analysis, association rules
refer to sets of pages that are accessed together with a support value
exceeding some specified threshold. (See Section 28.2 on association
rules.) These pages may not be directly connected to one another via
hyperlinks. For example, association rule discovery may reveal a correla-
tion between users who visited a page containing electronic products to
those who visit a page about sporting equipment.

© Clustering. In the Web usage domain, there are two kinds of interesting
clusters to be discovered: usage clusters and page clusters. Clustering of
users tends to establish groups of users exhibiting similar browsing pat-
terns. Such knowledge is especially useful for inferring user demographics
in order to perform market segmentation in e-commerce applications or
provide personalized Web content to the users. Clustering of pages is
based on the content of the pages, and pages with similar contents are
grouped together. This type of clustering can be utilized in Internet search
engines and in tools that provide assistance to Web browsing.

Classification. In the Web domain, one goal is to develop a profile of
users belonging to a particular class or category. This requires extraction
and selection of features that best describe the properties of a given class
or category of users. For example, an interesting pattern that may
be discovered would be: 60% of users who placed an online order in
/Product/Books are in the 18-25 age group and live in rented apartments.

© Sequential patterns. These kinds of patterns identify sequences of Web
accesses, which may be used to predict the next set of Web pages to be
accessed by a certain class of users. These patterns can be used by market-
ers to produce targeted advertisements on Web pages. Another type of
sequential pattern pertains to which items are typically purchased follow-
ing the purchase of a particular item. For example, after purchasing a
computer, a printer is often purchased.

| Dependency modeling. Dependency modeling aims to determine and
model significant dependencies among the various variables in the Web
domain. For example, one may be interested in building a model that rep-
resents the various stages a visitor undergoes while shopping in an online
store; this model would be based on user actions (e.g., being a casual visi-
tor versus being a serious potential buyer).

. Pattern analysis. The final step is to filter out those rules or patterns that

are considered to be not of interest based on the discovered patterns. One
common technique for pattern analysis is to use a query language such as
SQL to detect various patterns and relationships. Another technique
involves loading usage data into a data warehouse with ETL tools and per-
forming OLAP operations to view the data along multiple dimensions (see
Section 29.3). It is common to use visualization techniques, such as graph-
ing patterns or assigning colors to different values, to highlight patterns or
trends in the data.
