* Gi is called a carry generate , and it produces a carry of 1 when both Ai and Bi are 1,
regardless of the input carry Ci .

+ Piis called a carry propagate , because it determines whether a carry into stage i will
propagate into stage i+ 1

Binary ADDER-Subtractor

The addition and subtraction operations can be combined into one circuit with one
common binary adder by including an exclusive-OR gate with each full adder.

A four-bit adder—subtractor circuit is shown in Fig. 4.13 . The mode input M controls the
operation. When M = 0, the circuit is an adder, and when M = 1, the circuit becomes a
subtractor. Each exclusive-OR gate receives input M and one of the inputs of B.

When M = 0, we have B 0 = B. The full adders receive the value of B , the input carry is
O, and the circuit performs A plus B . When M = 1, we have B ® 1 =B’ and CO=1.TheB
inputs are all complemented and a 1 is added through the input carry. The circuit performs
the operation A plus the 2’s complement of B . (The exclusive-OR with output V is for
detecting an overflow.)
