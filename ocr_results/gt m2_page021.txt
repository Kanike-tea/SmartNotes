The binary relation “is greater than,” for example, is a transitive relation. If x; >
x; and x; > X,, Clearly x; > x;. “Is descendent of” is another example of a transitive
relation.

The digraph of a transitive (but irreflexive and asymmetric) binary relation is
shown in Fig. 9-4. Note the triangular subgraphs. A digraph representing a
transitive relation (on its vertex set) is called a transitive directed graph.

Equivalence Relation: A binary relation is called an equivalence relation if it
is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Some examples of equivalence relations
are “is parallel to,” “is equal to,” “is congruent to,” “is equal to modulo m,” and
“is isomorphic to.”

The graph representing an equivalence relation may be called an equivalence
graph. What does an equivalence graph look like? Let us look at an example,
consisting of the equivalence relation “is congruent to modulo 3” defined on the
set of 11 integers, 10 through 20. The graph is shown in Fig. 9-6. (Recall that
each undirected edge in Fig. 9-6 represents two parallel but oppositely directed
edges.)

In Fig. 9-6 we see that the vertex set of the graph is divided into three disjoint
classes, each in a separate component. Each component is an undirected
subgraph (due to symmetry) with a self-loop at each vertex (due to reflexivity).
Furthermore, in each component every vertex is related to (ie., joined by an
edge to) every other vertex.

In general, an equivalence relation on a set partitions the elements of the set
