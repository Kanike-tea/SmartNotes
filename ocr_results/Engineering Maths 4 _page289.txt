9. Froma sealed box containing a dozen apples it was found that 3 apples are perished. Obtain

the probability distribution of the number of perished apples when 2 apples are drawn at

random. Also find the mean and variance of this distribution.
>> Let X be the number of perished apples. Since 2 were drawn we have
X =0, 1, 2. 2 out of 12 can be selected in 12, ways. 9 are good apples and 3 are
perished apples. Hence we have ‘

P(X=2)=Probability of getting 2 perished apples=

The probability distribution is as follows.
X =x;

» Mean (M) =<Lagjatee Se atu l «
Variance (V) = Dxp,-w

-(o:2,4)_1_8 1-15
7 2° 2) 4° 2747
Thus Mean = 1/2 and Variance = 15/44

10. Ifthe random variable X take the values 1; 2, 3, 4 such that

2P(X =1)=3P(X =2) = P(X =3) =5P(X = 4), find the probability
distribution function of X. , ,

By data, 2p, = 3p, = p, = 5p, : -++(1)

Wealso have, Py +P) +P3tpy = 1°
