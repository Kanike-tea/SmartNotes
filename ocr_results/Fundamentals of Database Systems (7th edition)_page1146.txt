Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP

29.7 Difficulties of Implementing
Data Warehouses

Some significant operational issues arise with data warehousing: construction,
administration, and quality control. Project management—the design, construc-
tion, and implementation of the warehouse—is an important and challenging
consideration that should not be underestimated. The building of an enterprise-
wide warehouse in a large organization is a major undertaking, potentially taking
years from conceptualization to implementation. Because of the difficulty and
amount of lead time required for such an undertaking, the widespread develop-
ment and deployment of data marts may provide an attractive alternative, espe-
cially to those organizations with urgent needs for OLAP, DSS, and/or data
mining support.

The administration of a data warehouse is an intensive enterprise, proportional to
the size and complexity of the warehouse. An organization that attempts to admin-
ister a data warehouse must realistically understand the complex nature of its
administration. Although designed for read access, a data warehouse is no more a
static structure than any of its information sources. Source databases can be
expected to evolve. The warehouse’s schema and acquisition component must be
expected to be updated to handle these evolutions.

A significant issue in data warehousing is the quality control of data. Both quality
and consistency of data—especially as it relates to dimension data, which in turn
affects master data management—are major concerns. Although the data passes
through a cleaning function during acquisition, quality and consistency remain sig-
nificant issues for the database administrator and designer alike. Melding data from
heterogeneous and disparate sources is a major challenge given differences in nam-
ing, domain definitions, identification numbers, and the like. Every time a source
database changes, the data warehouse administrator must consider the possible
interactions with other elements of the warehouse.

Usage projections should be estimated conservatively prior to construction of the
data warehouse and should be revised continually to reflect current requirements.
As utilization patterns become clear and change over time, storage and access paths
can be tuned to remain optimized for support of the organization’s use of its ware-
house. This activity should continue throughout the life of the warehouse in order
to remain ahead of the demand. The warehouse should also be designed to accom-
modate the addition and attrition of data sources without major redesign. Sources
and source data will evolve, and the warehouse must accommodate such change.
Fitting the available source data into the data model of the warehouse will be a con-
tinual challenge, a task that is as much art as science. Because there is continual
rapid change in technologies, both the requirements and capabilities of the ware-
house will change considerably over time. Additionally, data warehousing technol-
ogy itself will continue to evolve for some time, so component structures and
functionalities will continually be upgraded. This certain change is an excellent
motivation for fully modular design of components.
