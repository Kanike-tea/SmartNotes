LAB PROGRAM 02 (a)

2 a) Defined as a function F as Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. Write a Python program which accepts a
value for N (where N >0) as input and pass this value to the function. Display suitable error

message if the condition for input value is not followed.
Aim: Demonstrating creation of functions, passing parameters and return values

PROGRAM EXPLANATION
The below program calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function

called fibonacci. Let's go through the program and its function step by step:

1. The fibonacci function takes an integer n as input, representing the position of the term to
calculate in the Fibonacci sequence.

2. The function begins with three base cases:

a. Ifn is less than or equal to 0, it prints an error message indicating that n must be
greater than 0, and then returns None.

b. Ifnis equal to 1, it returns 0, as the first term of the Fibonacci sequence is defined
as 0.

c. If n is equal to 2, it returns 1, as the second term of the Fibonacci sequence is
defined as 1.

3. If none of the base cases are satisfied, the function proceeds to calculate the nth term of
the Fibonacci sequence by recursively calling itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments. The
recursive call fibonacci(n-1) represents the (n-1)th term, and fibonacci(n-2) represents the
(n-2)th term.

4. The function continues to recursively call itself until it reaches one of the base cases, at

which point the recursive calls will start to return values.

5. Once the recursive calls have returned values, the function adds the results of

fibonacci(n-1) and fibonacci(n-2) and returns the sum, which represents the nth term of

the Fibonacci sequence.

6. The program prompts the user to enter a value for n, representing the position of the term

to calculate.

7. The program calls the fibonacci function with the user-provided value and stores the

result in the variable result.
