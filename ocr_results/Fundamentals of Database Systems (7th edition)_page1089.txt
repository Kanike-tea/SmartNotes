27.8 Trends in Information Retrieval

co-located, or in remote shared workspaces. Social psychologists have experimen-
tally validated that the act of social discussions has facilitated cognitive performance.
People in social groups can provide solutions (answers to questions), pointers to
databases or to other people (meta-knowledge), and validation and legitimization of
ideas; in addition, social groups can serve as memory aids and can help with problem
reformulation. Guided participation is a process in which people co-construct
knowledge in concert with peers in their community. Information seeking is mostly
a solitary activity on the Web today. Some recent work on collaborative search
reports several interesting findings and the potential of this technology for better
information access. It is increasingly common for people to use social networks such
as Facebook to seek opinions and clarifications on various topics and to read prod-
uct reviews before making a purchase.

27.8.3 Conversational Information Access

Conversational information access is an interactive and collaborative informa-
tion-finding interaction. The participants engage in a natural human-to-human
conversation, and intelligent agents listen to the conversation in the background
and perform intent extraction to provide participants with need-specific informa-
tion. Agents use direct or subtle interactions with participants via mobile or wear-
able communication devices. These interactions require technologies like speaker
identification, keyword spotting, automatic speech recognition, semantic under-
standing of conversations, and discourse analysis as a means of providing users
with faster and relevant pointers for conversations. Via technologies like those just
mentioned, information access is transformed from a solitary activity to a partici-
patory activity. In addition, information access becomes more goal specific as
agents use multiple technologies to gather relevant information and as participants
provide conversational feedback to agents.

27.8.4 Probabilistic Topic Modeling

The unprecedented growth in information generated with the advent of the Web
has led to issues concerning how to organize data into categories that will facilitate
correct and efficient dissemination of information. For example, international news
agencies like Reuters and the Associated Press gather daily news worldwide per-
taining to business, sports, politics, technology, and so on. It is a tremendous chal-
lenge to organize effectively this plethora of information. Search engines have
conventionally organized words within and links among documents to make them
accessible on the Web. Organizing information according to the topics and themes
of documents allows users to navigate through the vast amount of information
based on the topics they are interested in.

To address this problem, a class of machine learning algorithms known as
probabilistic topic models has emerged in the last decade. These algorithms can
automatically organize large collections of documents into relevant themes. The
beauty of these algorithms is that they are totally unsupervised, meaning that they
