Bioremediation refers to the use of microorganisms, plants, or animals to clean up
contaminated environments, such as soil, water, or air. This process occurs naturally over time, but
can also be accelerated through the addition of specific microorganisms or other bioticagents. The
goal of bioremediation is to remove contaminants from the environment and restoreit to a healthy

state.

Biomining, on the other hand, refers to the use of microorganisms to extract valuable
minerals from ore deposits. This process involves the use of microorganisms to dissolve minerals
from ore, creating a solution that can be separated and purified to obtain the valuable minerals.
Biomining is often used in the extraction of metals such as copper, gold, and nickel, and has
several advantages over traditional mining methods, including lower energy costs, reduced
waste, and increased metal recovery.

Bioremediation and biomining via microbial surface adsorption is a process that utilizes

microorganisms to remove heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic from
contaminated environments or ore deposits, respectively.
