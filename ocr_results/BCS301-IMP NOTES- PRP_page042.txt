2) Prove that the Markov Chain with Transition matrix A = VW, 0 Vy is irreducible.
VW, Vy 0

Sol": Given matrix A is a stochastic matrix (Being a transition matrix).
Also, all the elements of given matrix does have non-negative and the sum of each row=1.

:.Hence, all the entries in A* are nonnegative or positive and the sum of each row =1.
Hence the given transition matrix A is regular, consequently it follows that the given Markov Chain is
irreducible.

3) Find the fixed probability vector for the regular stochastic matrix A =

Since, the given matrix A is of second order.

Let Q = [x y] be the fixed probability vector, for every x > 0,y > 0&k& +y =1
