4) Used as heating oil — In many commercial & domestic boilers, biodiesel is also used as
heating fuel.

Define Biosensor. Explain the functions of lignolytic enzymes in bio-bleaching.
Answer:

Biosensors can be defined as analytical devices which include a combination of biological
detecting elements like a sensor system and a transducer. When we compare with any other
presently existing diagnostic device, these sensors are advanced in the conditions of
selectivity as well as sensitivity. The applications of these Biosensors mainly include
checking ecological pollution control, in the agriculture field as well as food industries. The
main features of biosensors are stability, cost, sensitivity, and reproducibility.

Ligninolytic enzymes play a key role in degradation and detoxification of lignocellulosic
waste in environment. The major ligninolytic enzymes are laccase, lignin peroxidase,
manganese peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase.

Ligninolytic fungi and enzymes (i.e., laccase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase)
have been applied recently in the production of second-generation biofuels.

White-rot fungi are the main producers of lignin-oxidizing enzymes. These fungi secrete a
number of oxidative enzymes and some hitherto unknown substances (mediators) into their
environment together effecting a slow but continuous degradation. The most important
lignin-oxidizing enzymes are lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases and laccases. Lignin
peroxidase and manganese peroxidase appear to constitute a major component of the
ligninolytic system.

+ Lignocellulosic waste is considered as a chief component of renewable biomass on
the Earth this consists of three major components such as cellulose (40%-50%),
hemicelluloses (25%-30%) and lignin (15%-20%).
