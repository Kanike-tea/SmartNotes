Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module III

The time for the remaining two loops is bounded by O(n + m). The first loop can iterate m times and
the second can iterate n times. So, the asymptotic computing time of this algorithm is O(n +m).

Erasing a circular list

If we wish to compute more polynomials, it would be useful to reclaim the NODEs that are being
used. This function erases a circular list pointed by ptr and adds the NODE to the availability list.
void cerase(POLY *ptr)

{

POLY* temp;

if (ptr )
{
temp = ptr>link
ptr->link=avail
avail = temp;
*ptr = NULL;
