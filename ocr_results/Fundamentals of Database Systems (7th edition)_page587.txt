read the next block and fill a buffer. The CPU can start processing a block once its
transfer to main memory is completed; at the same time, the disk I/O processor can
be reading and transferring the next block into a different buffer. This technique is
called double buffering and can also be used to read a continuous stream of blocks
from disk to memory. Double buffering permits continuous reading or writing of
data on consecutive disk blocks, which eliminates the seek time and rotational delay
for all but the first block transfer. Moreover, data is kept ready for processing, thus
reducing the waiting time in the programs.

16.3.1 Buffer Management

Buffer management and Replacement Strategies. For most large database
files containing millions of pages, it is not possible to bring all of the data into main
memory at the same time. We alluded to double buffering as a technique whereby
we can gain efficiency in terms of performing the I/O operation between the disk
and main memory into one buffer area concurrently with processing the data from
another buffer. The actual management of buffers and decisions about what buffers
to use to place a newly read page in the buffer is a more complex process. We use
the term buffer to refer to a part of main memory that is available to receive blocks
or pages of data from disk.? Buffer manager is a software component of a DBMS
that responds to requests for data and decides what buffer to use and what pages to
replace in the buffer to accommodate the newly requested blocks. The buffer man-
ager views the available main memory storage as a buffer pool, which has a collec-
tion of pages. The size of the shared buffer pool is typically a parameter for the
DBMS controlled by DBAs. In this section, we briefly discuss the workings of the
buffer manager and discuss a few replacement strategies.

°We use the terms page and block interchangeably in the current context.
