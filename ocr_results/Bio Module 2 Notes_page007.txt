(a) Raw Material Selection

¢« Common feedstocks: Corn starch, sugarcane, cassava, beet sugar.

e These crops are rich in carbohydrates, which are converted into lactic acid.

(b) Fermentation Process

1. Hydrolysis: Starch or cellulose is broken down into simple sugars (glucose).

2. Fermentation: Bacteria such as Lactobacillus convert glucose into lactic acid.

(c) Polymerization Process

Lactic acid monomers are polymerized using one of the following methods:

¢ Direct Polycondensation: Water is removed during polymerization to form PLA (low
molecular weight).
¢ Ring-Opening Polymerization (ROP): Lactic acid is converted into lactide, which

undergoes polymerization to produce high-quality PLA.

(d) PLA Processing

PLA is processed into pellets, films, or fibers and used for manufacturing various plastic

products.

Engineering applications of PLA bioplastic

e Automotive parts: PLA is used for the production of biodegradable automotive parts
such asair ducts and headlamp covers.

e Electronic Devices: PLA is used for the production of biodegradable components in
electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.

e Aerospace: PLA is used for the production of biodegradable parts in aerospace
applications,such as insulation and cable management.

¢ Sporting Goods: PLA is used for the production of biodegradable sporting goods
such asgolf tees and fishing lures.

¢ Construction: PLA is used for the production of biodegradable insulation and
soundproofingmaterials.

e Agricultural Equipment: PLA is used for the production of biodegradable parts in
agricultural equipment such as seed trays and greenhouse film.

¢ Medical Equipment: PLA is used for the production of biodegradable components in
