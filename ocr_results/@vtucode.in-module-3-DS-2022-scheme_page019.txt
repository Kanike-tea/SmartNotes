BINARY TREE TRAVERSALS

Visiting each node in a tree exactly once is called tree traversal The different methods of

traversing a binary tree are:
1. Preorder

. Inorder

2

3. Postorder
4. Iterative inorder Traversal
5

. Level-Order traversal

1. Inorder: Inorder traversal calls for moving down the tree toward the left until you cannot

go further. Then visit the node, move one node to the right and continue. If no move can be

done, then go back one more node.

Let ptr is the pointer which contains the location of the node N currently being scanned. L(N)

denotes the leftchild of node N and R(N) is the right child of node N
