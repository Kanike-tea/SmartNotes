ARRANGEMENT OF PRIORITY GROUPS

INTRI

Priority arbitration
circuit

¢ In this technique, devices are organizes in a group and each group is connected
to the processor at adifferent priority level.

¢ With in a group devices are connected in a daisy chain fashion as shown in the
figure.

Direct Memory Access (DMA)

e It is the process of transferring the block of data at high speed in between
main memory and external device (I/O devices) without continuous
intervention of CPU is called as DMA.

e The DMA operation is performed by one control circuit and is part of the 1/O
interface.

e This control circuit is called DMA controller. Hence DMA transfer operation is
performed by DMAcontroller.

e To initiate Directed data transfer between main memory and external devices
DMA controller needsparameters from the CPU.

e These 3 Parameters are:

1)Starting address of the

memory block.2)No of words to

be transferred.

3)Type of operation (Read or Write).
After receiving these 3 parameters from CPU, DMA controller establishes
directed data transferoperation between main memory and external devices
without the involvement of CPU.
