27.7 Web Search and Analysis

Web usage data describes the pattern of usage of Web pages, such as IP addresses,
page references, and the date and time of accesses for a user, user group, or an
application. Web usage analysis typically consists of three main phases: preprocess-
ing, pattern discovery, and pattern analysis.

1. Preprocessing. Preprocessing converts the information collected about
usage statistics and patterns into a form that can be utilized by the pattern
discovery methods. For example, we use the term page view to refer to pages
viewed or visited by a user. There are several different types of preprocessing
techniques available:

& Usage preprocessing analyzes the available collected data about usage
patterns of users, applications, and groups of users. Because this data is
often incomplete, the process is difficult. Data cleaning techniques are
necessary to eliminate the impact of irrelevant items in the analysis result.
Frequently, usage data is identified by an IP address and consists of click-
ing streams that are collected at the server. Better data is available if a
usage tracking process is installed at the client site.

© Content preprocessing is the process of converting text, image, scripts,
and other content into a form that can be used by the usage analysis.
Often, this process consists of performing content analysis such as classi-
fication or clustering. The clustering or classification techniques can group
usage information for similar types of Web pages, so that usage patterns
can be discovered for specific classes of Web pages that describe particular
topics. Page views can also be classified according to their intended use,
such as for sales or for discovery or for other uses.

© Structure preprocessing can be done by parsing and reformatting the
information about hyperlinks and structure between viewed pages. One
difficulty is that the site structure may be dynamic and may have to be
constructed for each server session.

2. Pattern discovery. The techniques that are used in pattern discovery are based
on methods from the fields of statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition,
data analysis, data mining, and other similar areas. These techniques are adapted
so they take into consideration the specific knowledge and characteristics of
Web analysis. For example, in association rule discovery (see Section 28.2), the
notion of a transaction for market-basket analysis considers the items to be
unordered. But the order of accessing of Web pages is important, and so it
should be considered in Web usage analysis. Hence, pattern discovery involves
mining sequences of page views. In general, using Web usage data, the following
types of data mining activities may be performed for pattern discovery.

Statistical analysis. Statistical techniques are the most common method
of extracting knowledge about visitors to a Web site. By analyzing the ses-
sion log, it is possible to apply statistical measures such as mean, median,
and frequency count to parameters such as pages viewed, viewing time
per page, length of navigation paths between pages, and other parameters
that are relevant to Web usage analysis.
