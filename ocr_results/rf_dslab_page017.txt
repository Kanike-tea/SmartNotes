5. Develop a Program in C for the following Stack Applications
la. Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators: +, -, *,/, %,”
lb. Solving Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks

Theory:
a) Evaluation of postfix expression with single digit operands and operators.
For each input symbol,
¢ — Ifitis a digit then, push it on to the stack.

¢ — If it is an operator then, pop out the top most two contents from the stack and apply the operator on
them. Later on, push the result on to stack.
* Ifthe input symbol is ‘\0’, empty the stack.

b) Tower of Hanoi, is a mathematical puzzle which consists of three towers (pegs) and more than one rings. These rings
are of different sizes and stacked upon in an ascending order, i.e. the smaller one sits over the larger one. There are
other variations of the puzzle where the number of disks increase, but the tower count remains the same.

A few rules to be followed for Tower of Hanoi are —

¢ Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
¢ Only the "top" disk can be removed.
e No large disk can sit over a small disk.

Program (a):

#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<ctype.h>

char s[50],ch;

int i,a,b,top=-1 ,stk[50],ans,num,elm;
void push(int num)

{
top=top+1;
stk[top]=num;
}
int pop()
{

elm=stk[top];
top=top-1;
return (elm);

void main()

{
printf("Enter the postfix expression\n");
scanf("%s" s);
for(i=0;s[i]!="\0'si++)

{

ch=s[i];

ifisdigit(ch))
push(ch-'0');

else

{
b=pop();
a=pop();
switch(ch)
{

case '+':push(a+b);
