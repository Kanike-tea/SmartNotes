2. If 4 colours are available, in how many different ways can the vertices of each graph in Figure
2.60 be properly coloured? .

3. For the graph shown in Figure 2.58, find the chromatic polynomial with the use of the decompo-
sition theorem.

4, For n > 3, Let G, be the graph obtained by deleting one edge from K,. Determine P(G,,, A) and
XG).
