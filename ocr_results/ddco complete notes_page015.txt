Prime Implicants
In choosing adjacent squares in a map, we must ensure that

(1) all the minterms of the function are covered when we combine the squares.
(2) the number of terms in the expression is minimized, and

(3) there are no redundant terms (i.e., Minterms already covered by other terms).

* A prime implicant is a product term obtained by combining the maximum
possible number of adjacent squares in the map.

* The prime implicants of a function can be obtained from the map by combining
all possible maximum numbers of squares.

* prime implicants are the building blocks used in the simplification of Boolean
functions

Essential Prime Implicant:

+ An essential prime implicant is a prime implicant that covers at least one
minterm that no other prime implicant covers.

essential prime implicants are a subset of prime implicants that are necessary to
cover specific minterms in order to achieve a minimal representation of the Boolean
function.

1) Simplify following four-variable Boolean function:
F(A, B, C, D) = =m (0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15)

The simplified expression is obtained from the logical sum of the two essential prime
implicants and any two prime implicants that cover minterms m3, m9, and m11..

Essential Prime Implicants are BD and B’D’

Prime Implicants are B’D’,CD,BD,AD

ers

Ss=BO+CD+BD+

There are four possible ways that the function can be expressed with four product
terms of two literals each:

F = BD+B'D'+CD+AD
= BD+B'D'+ CD + AB'
=BD+B'D'+ B'C+ AD
