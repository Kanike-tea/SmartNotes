DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 2

To obtain the configuration as shown in figure (e), follow the steps
1) Create a new array newQueue of twice the capacity.
2) Copy the second segment (i.e., the elements queue [front +1] through queue
[capacity-1]) to positions in newQueue beginning at 0.
3) Copy the first segment (i.e., the elements queue [0] through queue [rear]) to

positions in newQueue beginning at capacity — front — 1.

front= 15 rear = 6

(e) Alternative configuration
Below program gives the code to add to a circular queue using a dynamically allocated array.

void addq( element item)
{ /* add an item to the queue
rear = (rear +1) % capacity;
if(front == rear)
queueFull( ); /* double capacity */

queue[rear] = item;

Below program obtains the configuration of figure (e) and gives the code for queueFull.

The function copy (a,b,c) copies elements from locations a through b-1 to locations

beginning at c.

void queueFull( )
{ /* allocate an array with twice the capacity */
element *newQueue;
MALLOC ( newQueue, 2 * capacity * sizeof(* queue));
/* copy from queue to newQueue */
int start = ( front + ) % capacity;
if ( start < 2) /* no wrap around */

copy( queue+start, queue+start+capacity-1 newQueue);

else

{ /* queue wrap around */
