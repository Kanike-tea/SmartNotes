Results of a sequence of operations. (a) Rename, Lname, Salary (Spno=5(EMPLOYEE)).
(b) Using intermediate relations and renaming of attributes.

where the symbol p (rho) is used to denote the RENAME operator, S is the new rela-
tion name, and Bj, Bp, ... , By, are the new attribute names. The first expression
renames both the relation and its attributes, the second renames the relation only,
and the third renames the attributes only. If the attributes of R are (Aj, Ap, ... , An)
in that order, then each A; is renamed as B;.

In SQL, a single query typically represents a complex relational algebra expression.
Renaming in SQL is accomplished by aliasing using AS, as in the following example:

SELECT E.Fname AS First_name, E.Lname AS Last_name, E.Salary AS Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E
WHERE E.Dno=5,

8.2 Relational Algebra Operations
from Set Theory

8.2.1 The UNION, INTERSECTION, and MINUS Operations

The next group of relational algebra operations are the standard mathematical
operations on sets. For example, to retrieve the Social Security numbers of all
