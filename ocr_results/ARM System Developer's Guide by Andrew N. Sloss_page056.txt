2.7.4 ARM11 FAMILY

The ARM1136J-S, announced in 2003, was designed for high performance and power-
efficient applications. ARM1136J-S was the first processor implementation to execute
architecture ARMvV6 instructions. It incorporates an eight-stage pipeline with separate load-
store and arithmetic pipelines. Included in the ARMv6 instructions are single instruction
multiple data (SIMD) extensions for media processing, specifically designed to increase
video processing performance.

The ARM1136JE-S is an ARM1136J-S with the addition of the vector floating-point unit
for fast floating-point operations.

2.7.5 SPECIALIZED PROCESSORS

StrongARM was originally co-developed by Digital Semiconductor and is now exclusively
licensed by Intel Corporation. It is has been popular for PDAs and applications that require
performance with low power consumption. It isa Harvard architecture with separate D+ I
caches. StrongARM was the first high-performance ARM processor to include a five-stage
pipeline, but it does not support the Thumb instruction set.

Intel’s XScale is a follow-on product to the StrongARM and offers dramatic increases in
performance. At the time of writing, XScale was quoted as being able to run up to 1 GHz.
XScale executes architecture v5TE instructions. It is a Harvard architecture and is similar
to the StrongARM, as it also includes an MMU.

SC100 is at the other end of the performance spectrum. It is designed specifically
for low-power security applications. The $C100 is the first SecurCore and is based on
an ARM7TDMI core with an MPU. This core is small and has low voltage and current
requirements, which makes it attractive for smart card applications.

2.8 SUMMARY

In this chapter we focused on the hardware fundamentals of the actual ARM processor.
The ARM processor can be abstracted into eight components—ALU, barrel shifter, MAC,
register file, instruction decoder, address register, incrementer, and sign extend.

ARM has three instruction sets—ARM, Thumb, and Jazelle. The register file contains
37 registers, but only 17 or 18 registers are accessible at any point in time; the rest are
banked according to processor mode. The current processor mode is stored in the cpsr. It
holds the current status of the processor core as well interrupt masks, condition flags, and
state. The state determines which instruction set is being executed.

An ARM processor comprises a core plus the surrounding components that interface it
with a bus. The core extensions include the following:

= Caches are used to improve the overall system performance.

= TCMsare used to improve deterministic real-time response.
