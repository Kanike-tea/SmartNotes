THEOREM 8-11

The vertices of every planar graph can be properly colored with five colors.

Proof: The theorem will be proved by induction. Since the vertices of all
graphs (self-loop-free, of courset) with 1, 2,3,4, or 5 vertices can be properly
colored with five colors, let us assume that vertices of every planar graph with n
— 1 vertices can be properly colored with five colors. Then, if we prove that any
planar graph G with n vertices will require no more than five colors, we shall
have proved the theorem.

Consider the planar graph G with n vertices. Since G is planar, it must have at
least one vertex with degree five or less (Problem 5-4). Let this vertex be v.

Let G' be a graph (of n— 1 vertices) obtained from G by deleting vertex v (i.e.,
v and all edges incident on v). Graph G' requires no more than five colors,
according to the induction hypothesis. Suppose that the vertices in G' have been
properly colored, and now we add to it v and all edges incident on v. If the
degree of v is 1, 2, 3, or 4, we have no difficulty in assigning a proper color to v.

This leaves only the case in which the degree of v is five, and all the five
colors have been used in coloring the vertices adjacent to v, as shown in Fig. 8-
15(a). (Note that Fig. 8-15 is part of a planar representation of graph G'.)

Suppose that there is a path in G' between vertices a and c colored alternately
with colors 1 and 3, as shown in Fig. 8-15(b). Then a similar path between b and
d, colored alternately with colors 2 and 4, cannot exist; otherwise, these two
paths will intersect and cause G to be nonplanar. (This is a consequence of the
Jordan curve theorem, used in Section 5-3, also.)

If there is no path between b and d colored alternately with colors 2 and 4,
starting from vertex b we can interchange colors 2 and 4 of all vertices
connected to b through vertices of alternating colors 2 and 4. This interchange
will paint vertex b with color 4 and yet keep G' properly colored. Since vertex d
is still with color 4, we have color 2 left over with which to paint vertex v.

Had we assumed that there was no path between a and c of vertices painted
alternately with colors 1 and 3, we would have released color 1 or 3 instead of
color 2. And thus the theorem. =
