«Temporary Registers - There are 3 temporary registers in the processor. Registers
- Y, Z & Temp are used for temporary storage during program-execution. The
programmer cannot access these 3 registers.

In ALU, 1) “A“ input gets the operand from the output of the multiplexer (MUX).

2) “B™ input gets the operand directly from the processor-bus.

¢ There are 2 options provided for “A“ input of the ALU.

« MUX is used to select one of the 2 inputs.

¢ MUX selects either

— output of Y or

— constant-value 4( which is used to increment PC content).

¢ An instruction is executed by performing one or more of the following operations:
1) Transfer a word of data from one register to another or to the ALU.
2) Perform arithmetic or a logic operation and store the result in a register.
