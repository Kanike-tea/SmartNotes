27.7 Web Search and Analysis

High precision is achieved almost always at the expense of recall and vice versa. It is
a matter of the application’s context whether to tune the system for high precision
or high recall. F-score is typically used as a single measure that combines precision
and recall to compare different result sets:

One of the properties of harmonic mean is that the harmonic mean of two numbers
tends to be closer to the smaller of the two. Thus F is automatically biased toward

the smaller of the precision and recall values. Therefore, for a high F-score, both
precision and recall must be high.

27.7 Web Search and Analysis”°

The emergence of the Web has brought millions of users to search for information,
which is stored in a very large number of active sites. To make this information
accessible, search engines such as Google, bing and Yahoo! must crawl and index
these sites and document collections in their index databases. Moreover, search
engines must regularly update their indexes given the dynamic nature of the Web
as new Web sites are created and current ones are updated or deleted. Since there
are many millions of pages available on the Web on different topics, search engines
must apply many sophisticated techniques such as link analysis to identify the
importance of pages.

There are other types of search engines besides the ones that regularly crawl the
Web and create automatic indexes: these are human-powered, vertical search
engines or metasearch engines. These search engines are developed with the help of
computer-assisted systems to aid the curators with the process of assigning indexes.
They consist of manually created specialized Web directories that are hierarchically
organized indexes to guide user navigation to different resources on the Web. Vertical
search engines are customized topic-specific search engines that crawl and index a
specific collection of documents on the Web and provide search results from that
specific collection. Metasearch engines are built on top of search engines: they
query different search engines simultaneously and aggregate and provide search
results from these sources.

Another source of searchable Web documents is digital libraries. Digital libraries
can be broadly defined as collections of electronic resources and services for the
delivery of materials in a variety of formats. These collections may include a univer-
sity’s library catalog, catalogs from a group of participating universities, as in the
