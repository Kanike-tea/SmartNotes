(ii) We have to find f(0)
* f(0) = 25-5, = 25x 1 = 25
; 0

Expected number of families with’ girls is 25.

(iii), We have to find f(2)+f(3)

= 25-50, +25 Bo, = 50-8, = 50 x 10 = 500
Expected number of fainilies with 2 or 3 boys is 500.

(iv) At most 2 girls means that, families can have 5 boys and 0 girls or 4 boys and 1
girl or 3 boys and 2 girls. °

= 25(14+5+10) = 25 x 16 =.400
Expected number of families with atmost 2 girls is 400.

%7, Five dice were thrown 96 times and the number of times an odd number actually turned
out in the experiment is given. Fit a binomial distribution to this data and calculate the
ected frequencies.

“This is the binomial probability distribution function.

Since 5 dice were thrown 96 times, expected frequencies are obtained from
f(x) = 96P(x) where x= 0,1, 2,3, 4,5
