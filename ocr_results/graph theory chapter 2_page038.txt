Multiplication Theorem
The following theorem gives an expression for P(G, A) for a special class of graphs.

Theorem 2 . Ifa graph G has subgraphs Gy ‘and G2 such that G1 UG) = Gand G| NG2 = Ky
for some positive integer.n, then

PG,A) = AE1 Ad PCat)

where ‘ wae Ne
a = AA-IA~2)...A=nF 1),

Proof: Since K, = Gj NG and y(K,) = n, it follows that Ky is a subgraph of both G; and G2
and y(G;) > n and y(G2) > n.

Given A > n number of different colours, there are 1 = A(A=1)(A-1)(A=2) 1. (Aen +1)
number of proper colourings of K,". For each of these a) proper colourings of K,, the Product
Rule yields P(G), a)/A™ ways of properly colouring the remaining vertices of Gj. Similarly,
there are P(G2, a)/A ways of properly colouring the remaining vertices of G3. As such,

P(G1,a) P(G2,a

This completes the proof of the theorem.
