described in Section 2.2.5 is modified by adding four additional flag bits to represent each
8-bit slice of the data path. The newly modified cpsr register with the GE bits is shown in
Figure 15.1 and Table 15.4. The functionality of each GE bit is that of a “greater than or
equal” flag for each slice through the datapath.

Operating systems already save the cpsr register on a context switch. Adding these bits
to the cpsr has little effect on OS support for the architecture.

In addition to basic arithmetic operations on the SIMD data slices, there is considerable
use for operations that allow the picking of individual data elements within the datapath and
forming new ensembles of these elements. A select instruction SEL can independently select
each eight-bit field from one source register Rn or another source register Rm, depending

on the associated GE flag.
