DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 2

Function deleteq is similar to pop since nodes are removing that is currently at the start
of the list. Typical function calls would be addq (i, item); and item = deleteq (i);
APPLICATIONS OF LINKED LISTS —~ POLYNOMIALS

L. Representation of the polynomial:

0

A(X) = yx" + 0+ Hagx®
where the ai are nonzero coefficients and the ei are nonnegative integer exponents such that
em-l>em-2 >...>el >e0 > 0.

Present each term as a node containing coefficient and exponent fields, as well as a pointer
tothe next term.

Assuming that the coefficients are integers, the type declarations are:

typedef struct polyNode
*polyPointer; typedef struct {
int coef; int expon;
polyPointer link;
} polyNode;
polyPointer a,b;

We draw polynomial nodes as:

coef | expon | link
