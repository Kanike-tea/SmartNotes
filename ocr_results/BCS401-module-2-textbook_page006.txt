Decrease-and-Conquer

he decrease-and-conquer technique is based on exploiting the relationship

between a solution to a given instance of a problem and a solution to its
smaller instance. Once such a relationship is established, it can be exploited either
top down or bottom up. The former leads naturally to a recursive implementa-
tion, although, as one can see from several examples in this chapter, an ultimate
implementation may well be nonrecursive. The bottom-up variation is usually
implemented iteratively, starting with a solution to the smallest instance of the
problem; it is called sometimes the incremental approach.

There are three major variations of decrease-and-conquer:

m™ decrease by a constant
decrease by a constant factor
variable size decrease

In the decrease-by-a-constant variation, the size of an instance is reduced
by the same constant on each iteration of the algorithm. Typically, this constant
is equal to one (Figure 4.1), although other constant size reductions do happen
occasionally.

Consider, as an example, the exponentiation problem of computing a” where
a #0 and n is a nonnegative integer. The relationship between a solution to an
instance of size n and an instance of size n — 1 is obtained by the obvious formula
a" =a"! .a. So the function f (7) = a” can be computed either “top down” by
using its recursive definition
