¢ Cluster (shared nothing + shared disk: SAN/NAS), which is formed by a group of connected
computers.

Distributed Database:

><A centralized distributed database management system (DDBMS) manages the database as if it
were all stored on the same computer. The DDBMS synchronizes all the data periodically and, in
cases where multiple users must access the same data, ensures that updates and deletes performed
on the data at one location will be automatically reflected in the data stored elsewhere.

>The users and administrators of a distributed system, should, with proper implementation,
interact with the system as if the system was centralized. This transparency allows for the
functionality desired in such a structured system without special programming requirements,
allowing for any number of local and/or remote tables to be accessed at a given time across the
network.

The different types of transparency sought after ina DDBMS are
1. data distribution transparency,

2. heterogeneity transparency,
3. transaction transparency, and
4. performance transparency.

Data distribution transparency requires that the user of the database should not have to know
how the data is fragmented (fragmentation transparency), know where the data they access is
actually located (location transparency), or be aware of whether multiple copies of the data exist
(replication transparency).

Heterogeneity transparency requires that the user should not be aware of the fact that they are
using a different DBMS if they access data from a remote site. The user should be able to use the
same language that they would normally use at their regular access point and the DDBMS should
handle query language translation if needed.

Transaction transparency requires that the DDBMS guarantee that concurrent transactions do not
interfere with each other (concurrency transparency) and that it must also handle database recovery
