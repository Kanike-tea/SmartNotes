4.3 Network Flows

In several transport networks, like the networks-of-telephone lines, rail roads, oil or water
Pipelines, a knowledge about the maximum rate of flow that is possible from one station to
another is essential. Such knowledge can be acquired through a study of weighted connected’
graphs in which the vertices represent stations and the edges represent the lines of the network.
Insuch graphs, the weight of an edge represents the capacity of the line; namely, the maximum
amount of flow possible per unit of time. :

Ina graphical study of transport networks of the type mentioned above, it will be assumed
that, at each vertex representing an intermediate station, the total rate of commodity (number
of telephone calls, number of trains, amounts of water or oil) entering is equal to the rate
of leaving and that the flow through a vertex is limited only by the’ capacities of the edges
Tepreseriting the network lines incident on it. In other words, it will be assumed that there is'no
‘ccumulation or generation of the commodity at any vertex along the way and that the vertex
‘self can handle as much flow as allowed through the edges. It will further be assumed that the
