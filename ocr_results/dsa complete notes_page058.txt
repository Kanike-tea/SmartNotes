Data Structures and Applications(BCS304) Module 2

Instead of using the malloc function the following getnode() function can be used to get a new

node
NODE * getNode(void)
{
/* provide a node for use */NODE
* new;
if (avail)
{
new = avail;
avail = avail—link;
return new;
3
else
{
new=( NODE *)malloc(sizeof(NODE));
return new;
}
}

Instead of the free function the following retnode function can be used

void retNode(NODE *temp)
{/* return a node to the available list */
temp—link = avail;
avail = avail;

}

Garbage collection

e Suppose some memory space becomes reusable because a node is deleted from a list or an
entire list is deleted from a program, we can make this space to be available for future use.
One way is to immediately reinsert the space into the free storage list.

e This is done when a list is implemented by linear arrays. But this method may be too time
consuming for the operating system of the computer. So an alternate method is devised.

e The operating system of a computer may periodically collect all the deleted space on to the
free storage list this technique si called garbage collection

Garbage collection takes place into two steps
e Runs through all the list an marks those cells which are currently in use
e Then the computer runs through the memory collecting all unmarked space on to the free
storage list

Garbage collection takes place when
¢ The space is minimal or
© No space is left or
¢ when the CPU is idle and has time to do collection.
