Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module III

To determine satisfiability (x1,x2,x3) must take all possible combinations of true or false values and
check the formula for each combination. For n variables ther are 2" possible combinations of true=t
and false=f.

Example: For n=3 the eight combinations are (t,t,t),(t.t,f),(t.f.0.(t£.,(ft.0, (£0, (£60.(66).

The node structure for the satisfaibility problem is given as follows

leftchild | Data | value | rightchild

The node structure can be defined as follows

typedef enum {not,and, or, true, false } logical;
struct node

{

Struct node *leftchild;

Logical data;

Short int value;

Structnode * rightchild;

a
Typedef struct node TNODE;

Algorithm to determine satisfiability

For (all 2" possible combinations)
{
Generate the next combination;
Replace the variables by their values;
Evaluate the root by traversing it in postorder;
Tf (root->value)
{
Printf(<combination>);
Return;

}
}

Printf(“ No satisfiable combination”);

Analysis: This algorithm will take O(g.2" ) or exponential time, where g is the time to substitute
values for x1,x2.......... xn and evaluate the expression.

Postorder Evaluation function: To evaluate an expression, the tree is traversed in postorder. When
a node is visited the value of the expression represented by the left and right sub trees of a node are
computed first. So the recursive postorder traversal algorithm is modified to obtain the function that
evaluates the tree.

Void postorderEval(TNODE *node)

{
Tf (node)
