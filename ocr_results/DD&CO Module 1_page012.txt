corresponding to each square can be obtained from the concatenation of the row number with the column

number. For example, the numbers of the third row (11) and the second column (01), when concatenated,

give the binary number 110

The map is considered to lie on a surface with the top and bottom edges, as well as the right and left

edges, touching each other to form adjacent squares. For example, m0 and m2 form adjacent squares, as

do m3 and m11. The combination of adjacent squares that is useful during the simplification process is

easily determined from inspection of the four-variable map:

One square represents one minterm, giving a term with four literals.

Two adjacent squares represent a term with three literals.

Four adjacent squares represent a term with two literals.

Eight adjacent squares represent a term with one literal.

Sixteen adjacent squares produce a function that is always equal to 1.

No other combination of squares can simplify the function
