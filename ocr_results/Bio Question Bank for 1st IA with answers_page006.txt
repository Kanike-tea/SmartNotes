d. Oligopotent Stem Cells: Adult lymphoid or myeloid cells are oligopotent. They can

differentiate into a few different types of cells.

e. Unipotent Stem Cells: They can produce cells only of their own type. Since they have the
ability to renew themselves, they are known as unipotent stem cells. E.g., Muscle stem

cells.
2. Adult Stem Cells:

These stem cells are obtained from developed organs and tissues. They can repair and replace
the damaged tissues in the region where they are located. For eg., hematopoietic stem cells are
found in the bone marrow. These stem cells are used in bone marrow transplants to treat specific

types of cancers.

3. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells:

These cells have been tested and arranged by converting tissue-specific cells into embryonic
cells in the lab. These cells are accepted as an important tool to learn about the normal
development, onset and progression of the disease and are also helpful in testing various drugs.
These stem cells share the same characteristics as embryonic cells do. They also have the

otential to give rise to all the different types of cells in the human body.

4. Mesenchymal Stem Cells

These cells are mainly formed from the connective tissues surrounding other tissues and organs,
nown as the stroma. These mesenchymal stem cells are accurately called stromal cells. The
first mesenchymal stem cells were found in the bone marrow that is capable of developing

ones, fat cells, and cartilage.

There are different mesenchymal stem cells that are used to treat various diseases as they have

een developed from different tissues of the human body. The characteristics of mesenchymal

stem cells depend on the organ from where they originate.
Applications of Stem Cells
Following are the important applications of stem cells:

1. Tissue Regeneration: This is the most important application of stem cells. The stem cells
can be used to grow a specific type of tissue or organ. This can be helpful in kidney and

liver transplants. The doctors have already used the stem cells from beneath the epidermis
