30.1 Introduction to Database Security Issues

such databases can be covered by access control, which is explained in the next
section. The situation becomes tricky when some of the data is sensitive whereas
other data is not.

Several factors can cause data to be classified as sensitive:

1. Inherently sensitive. The value of the data itself may be so revealing or con-
fidential that it becomes sensitive—for example, a person’s salary or who a
patient has HIV/AIDS.

2. From a sensitive source. The source of the data may indicate a need for
secrecy—for example, an informer whose identity must be kept secret.

3. Declared sensitive. The owner of the data may have explicitly declared it as
sensitive.

4. A sensitive attribute or sensitive record. The particular attribute or record
may have been declared sensitive—for example, the salary attribute of an
employee or the salary history record in a personnel database.

5. Sensitive in relation to previously disclosed data. Some data may not be
sensitive by itself but will become sensitive in the presence of some other
data—for example, the exact latitude and longitude information for a loca-
tion where some previously recorded event happened that was later deemed
sensitive.

It is the responsibility of the database administrator and security administrator to
collectively enforce the security policies of an organization. This dictates whether
access should or should not be permitted to a certain database attribute (also known
as a table column or a data element) for individual users or for categories of users.
Several factors must be considered before deciding whether it is safe to reveal the
data. The three most important factors are data availability, access acceptability,
and authenticity assurance.

1. Data availability. Ifa user is updating a field, then this field becomes inac-
cessible and other users should not be able to view this data. This blocking
is only temporary and only to ensure that no user sees any inaccurate data.
This is typically handled by the concurrency control mechanism (see
Chapter 21).

2. Access acceptability. Data should only be revealed to authorized users. A
database administrator may also deny access to a user request even if the
request does not directly access a sensitive data item, on the grounds that the
requested data may reveal information about the sensitive data that the user
is not authorized to have.

3. Authenticity assurance. Before granting access, certain external character-
istics about the user may also be considered. For example, a user may only
be permitted access during working hours. The system may track previous
queries to ensure that a combination of queries does not reveal sensitive
data. The latter is particularly relevant to statistical database queries (see
Section 30.5).
