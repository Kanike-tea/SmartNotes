Introduction:
Exceptions and interrupts are unexpected events which will disrupt the
normal flow of execution of instruction. An exception i$ an unexpected
event from within the processor. Interrupt is an unexpected event from
outside the process.Whenever an exception or interrupt occurs, the
hardware starts executing the code that performs an action in response to
the exception.

The following types of action can cause an exception:

@ Reset is called by the processor when power is applied. This
instruction branches to the initialization code.

@ Undefined instruction is used when the processor cannot decode an
instruction.

© Software interrupt is called when we execute a SWI instruction. The
SWI instruction is frequently used as the mechanism to invoke an
operating system routine.

@ Prefetch.abort occurs when the processor attempts to fetch an
instruction from an address without the correct access permissions.
The actual abort occurs in the decode stage.

@ Data abort is similar to a prefetch abort but is raised when an
instruction attempts to access data memory without the correct access
permissions.

@ Interrupt request is used by external hardware to interrupt the normal
execution flow of the processor. It can only be raised if IRQs are not
masked in the cpsr.

4.1 Exception handling

An exception is any condition that needs to halt the normal sequential
execution of instructions.

Example for exceptions are: ARM core reset, instruction fetch or
memory access failure, an undefined instruction fetch ,execution of
software interrupt instruction ,when an external interrupt has been raised.
