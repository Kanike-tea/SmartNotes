Repeated Trials

. Arandom experiment with only two’ possible ou outcomes categorized as success and

failure is called a Bernoulli trial where the probability of success p is same for each
trial.

© Bernoulli’s Theorem ,
The probability of x successes in n trials is equal to 16, r q’ * where p is the
probability of success and q is the probability of failure.

Proof : Since p is the probability of success, the a of x successes is
pop pe--x times = p*
Also x cemelunaty (n= x) failures and since q is the probability of failure, the
probability of (| =x) failures is q*

By the multiplication rule the probability of the simultaneous Happening is pq"

But x successes in 7m trials can occur in Nc ‘ways and all these cases are favourable

to the event.

Ry a a by the addition rule, the probobility t's x successes out of n trials is given by

This proves Bernoulli’ s theorem.
