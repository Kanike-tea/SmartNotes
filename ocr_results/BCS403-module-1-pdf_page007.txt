Database Management System [BCS403]

Program-Data Independence: In traditional file processing, the structure of the data files
accessed by an application is "hard-coded" in its source code. If, for some reason, we decide
to change the structure of the data ,everyapplication in which a description of that file's

structure is hard-coded must be changed!

In contrast, DBMS access programs, in most cases, do not require such changes, because the
structure of the data is described separately from the programs that access it and those
programs consult the catalog in order to ascertain the structure of the data so that they

interpret that data properly.

In other words, the DBMS provides a conceptual or logical view of the data to application
programs, so that the underlying implementation may be changed without the programs being

modified. (This is referred to as program-data independence.)

Program-operation independence: In object-oriented and object-relationalsystems , users
can define operations on data as part of the databasedefinitions.An operation (also called a
function or method) is specified in two parts.The interface (or signature) of an operation
includes the operation name and thedata types of its arguments (or parameters). The
implementation (or method) of theoperation is specified separately and can be changed
without affecting the interface User application programs can operate on the data by invoking
these operationsthrough their names and arguments, regardless of how the operations are

implemented.This may be termed program-operation independence.

Data abstraction

The characteristic that allows program-data | independence and __ program-
operationindependence is called data abstraction. A DBMS provides users with a conceptual
representationof data that does not include many of the details of how the data isstored or how
the operations are implemented. Informally, a data model is a type ofdata abstraction that is
used to provide this conceptual representation. The datamodel uses logical concepts, such as
objects, their properties, and their interrelationships,that may be easier for most users to
understand than computer storageconcepts. Hence, the data model hides storage and

implementation details that arenot of interest to most database users.
