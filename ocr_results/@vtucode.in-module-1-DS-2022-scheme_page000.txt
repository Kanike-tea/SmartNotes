DATA STRUCTURE

Data structure is a representation of the logical relationships existing between individual
elements of data. A data structure is a way of organizing all data items that considers not only
the elements stored but also their relationship to each other.

The logical or mathematical model of a particular organization of data is called a data

structure.

The choice of a particular data model depends on the two considerations:

1. It must be rich enough in structure to mirror the actual relationships of the data in the real
world.

2. The structure should be simple.enough that one can effectively process the data whenever
necessary.

BASIC TERMINOLOGY

Elementary Data Organization

Data: Dataare simply values or sets of values.

Data items: Data items refers to a single unit of values. Data items that are divided into sub-
items are called Group items. Ex: An Employee Name may be divided into three subitems-
first name, middle name, and last name. Data items that are not able to divide into sub-items
are called Elementary items. Ex: SSN

Entity: An entity is something that has certain attributes or properties which may be assigned
values. The values may be either numeric or non-numeric. Ex: Attributes- Names, Age, Sex,
SSN Values- Rohland Gail, 34, F, 134-34-5533 Entities with similar attributes form an entity
set. Each attribute of an entity set has a range of values, the set of all possible values that
could be assigned to the particular attribute. The term “information” is sometimes used for

data with given attributes, of, in other words meaningful or processed data.
