16.9 Other Primary File Organizations

STUDENT record can have a connecting field Major_dept whose value gives the name
of the DEPARTMENT in which the student is majoring. This Major_dept field refers to
a DEPARTMENT entity, which should be represented by a record of its own in the
DEPARTMENT file. If we want to retrieve field values from two related records, we
must retrieve one of the records first. Then we can use its connecting field value to
retrieve the related record in the other file. Hence, relationships are implemented by
logical field references among the records in distinct files.

File organizations in object DBMSs, as well as legacy systems such as hierarchical
and network DBMSs, often implement relationships among records as physical
relationships realized by physical contiguity (or clustering) of related records or by
physical pointers. These file organizations typically assign an area of the disk to
hold records of more than one type so that records of different types can be
physically clustered on disk. If a particular relationship is expected to be used
frequently, implementing the relationship physically can increase the system’s
efficiency at retrieving related records. For example, if the query to retrieve a
DEPARTMENT record and all records for STUDENTs majoring in that department is
frequent, it would be desirable to place each DEPARTMENT record and its cluster of
STUDENT records contiguously on disk in a mixed file. The concept of physical
clustering of object types is used in object DBMSs to store related objects together
in a mixed file. In data warehouses (see Chapter 29), the input data comes from a
variety of sources and undergoes an integration initially to collect the required data
into an operational data store (ODS). An ODS typically contains files where
records of multiple types are kept together. It is passed on to a data warehouse after
ETL (extract, transform and load) processing operations are performed on it.

To distinguish the records in a mixed file, each record has—in addition to its field
values—a record type field, which specifies the type of record. This is typically the
first field in each record and is used by the system software to determine the type of
record it is about to process. Using the catalog information, the DBMS can deter-
mine the fields of that record type and their sizes, in order to interpret the data
values in the record.

16.9.2 B-Trees and Other Data Structures
as Primary Organization

Other data structures can be used for primary file organizations. For example, if
both the record size and the number of records in a file are small, some DBMSs
offer the option of a B-tree data structure as the primary file organization. We
will describe B-trees in Section 17.3.1, when we discuss the use of the B-tree data
structure for indexing. In general, any data structure that can be adapted to the
characteristics of disk devices can be used as a primary file organization for
record placement on disk. Recently, column-based storage of data has been pro-
posed as a primary method for storage of relations in relational databases. We
will briefly introduce it in Chapter 17 as a possible alternative storage scheme for
relational databases.
