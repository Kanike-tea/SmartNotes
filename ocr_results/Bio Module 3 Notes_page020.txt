Interpretation of Results

The results of spirometry can be used to determine if the lungs are functioning normally and
to diagnose lung conditions. For example, a decrease in the volume of air exhaled or a decrease in
the flow rate of the exhaled air can indicate a restriction in the airways, which can be a sign of a
lung condition such as asthma or COPD.
