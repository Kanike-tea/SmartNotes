15.2 Properties of Relational Decompositions

matter what decomposition is chosen for the relation TEACH(Student, Course,
Instructor) from the three provided in the text, one or both of the dependencies orig-
inally present are bound to be lost. We now state a claim related to this property
without providing any proof.

Claim 1. It is always possible to find a dependency-preserving decomposition
D with respect to F such that each relation R; in D is in 3NF.

15.2.3 Nonadditive (Lossless) Join Property
of a Decomposition

Another property that a decomposition D should possess is the nonadditive join
property, which ensures that no spurious tuples are generated when a NATURAL
JOIN operation is applied to the relations resulting from the decomposition. We
already illustrated this problem in Section 14.1.4 with the example in Fig-
ures 14.5 and 14.6. Because this is a property of a decomposition of relation
schemas, the condition of no spurious tuples should hold on every legal relation
state—that is, every relation state that satisfies the functional dependencies in F.
Hence, the lossless join property is always defined with respect to a specific set F
of dependencies.

Definition. Formally, a decomposition D = {Rj, Rj, ... , Ry,} of R has the
lossless (nonadditive) join property with respect to the set of dependencies
F on R if, for every relation state r of R that satisfies F, the following holds,
where * is the NATURAL JOIN of all the relations in D: (mR, (r), seep TE, (7) =r.

The word loss in lossless refers to loss of information, not to loss of tuples. If a
decomposition does not have the lossless join property, we may get additional spu-
rious tuples after the PROJECT (7) and NATURAL JOIN (+) operations are applied;
these additional tuples represent erroneous or invalid information. We prefer the
term nonadditive join because it describes the situation more accurately. Although
the term lossless join has been popular in the literature, we used the term nonaddi-
tive join in describing the NJB property in Section 14.5.1. We will henceforth use the
term nonadditive join, which is self-explanatory and unambiguous. The nonaddi-
tive join property ensures that no spurious tuples result after the application of
PROJECT and JOIN operations. We may, however, sometimes use the term lossy
design to refer to a design that represents a loss of information. The decomposition
of EMP_PROJ(Ssn, Pnumber, Hours, Ename, Pname, Plocation) in Figure 14.3 into
EMP_LOCS(Ename, Plocation) and EMP_PROJ1(Ssn, Pnumber, Hours, Pname, Plocation)
in Figure 14.5 obviously does not have the nonadditive join property, as illustrated
by the partial result of NATURAL JOIN in Figure 14.6. We provided a simpler test
in case of binary decompositions to check if the decomposition is nonadditive—it
was called the NJB property in Section 14.5.1. We provide a general procedure for
testing whether any decomposition D of a relation into n relations is nonadditive
with respect to a set of given functional dependencies F in the relation; it is pre-
sented as Algorithm 15.3.
