Database Management System [BCS403]

= The drawback is having an extra relation, and requiring an extra join operation when

combining related tuples from the tables.

Step 4: Mapping of Binary 1:N Relationship Types

« For each regular binary 1:N relationship type R, identify the relation S that represents the
participating entity type at the N-side of the relationship type.

= Include as foreign key in S the primary key of the relation 7 that represents the other entity

type participating in R

* Include any simple attributes (or simple components of composite attributes),of the 1:N
relationship type as attributes of S

= In our example, we now map the 1:N relationship types WORKS_FOR, CONTROLS, and
SUPERVISION

« For WORKS _FOR we include the primary key Dnumber of the DEPARTMENT relation as
foreign key in the EMPLOYEE relation and call it Dno.

* For SUPERVISION we include the primary key of the EMPLOYEE relation as foreign key
in the EMPLOYEE relation itself—because the relationship is recursive—and call it
Super_ssn.

= The CONTROLS relationship is mapped to the foreign key attribute Dnum of PROJECT,
which references the primary key Dnumber of the DEPARTMENT relation.

Step 5: Mapping of Binary M:N Relationship Types

= For each binary M:N relationship type
+ Create a new relation S
+ Include primary key of participating entity types as foreign key attributes in S
+ Include any simple attributes of M:N relationship type

= In our example, we map the M:N relationship type WORKS_ON by creating the relation
WORKS ON.We include the primary keys of the PROJECT and EMPLOYEE relations as
foreign keys in WORKS _ON and rename them Pno and Essn, respectively.

= We also include an attribute Hours in WORKS_ON to represent the Hours attribute of the
relationship type.

« The primary key of the WORKS_ON relation is the combination of the foreign key

attributes {Essn, Pno}.

WORKS ON

Essn | Pno | Hours
