PROCESSOR CLOCK
© Processor circuits are controlled by a timing signal called a Clock.
© The clock defines regular time intervals called Clock Cycles.
© To execute a machine instruction, the processor divides the action to be performed into a sequence of
basic steps such that each step can be completed in one clock cycle.
« Let P= Length of one clock
cycle R = Clock rate.

-1
Relation between P and R is given by Ree
« R is measured in cycles per second.
* Cycles per second is also called Hertz (Hz)

BASIC PERFORMANCE EQUATION
. Let T= Processor time required to executed a
program. N = Actual number of instruction
executions.
S = Average number of basic steps needed to execute one machine instruction. R =
Clock rate in cycles per second.

* The program execution time is T= Nxs given by

¢ Equ1 is referred to as the basic performance equation.

* To achieve high performance, the computer designer must reduce the value of T, which means

reducing N and S, and increasing R.
> The value of N is reduced if source program is compiled into fewer machine instructions.
> The value of S is reduced if instructions have a smaller number of basic steps to perform.
> The value of R can be increased by using a higher frequency clock.

* Care has to be taken while modifying values since changes in one parameter may affect the other.

CLOCK RATE
* There are 2 possibilities for increasing the clock rate R:

1) Improving the IC technology makes logic-circuits faster.

This reduces the time needed to compute a basic step. (IC > integrated circuits).
This allows the clock period P to be reduced and the clock rate R to be increased.

2) Reducing the amount of processing done in one basic step also reduces the clock period P.
+ In presence of a cache, the percentage of accesses to the main-memory is small.

Hence, much of performance-gain expected from the use of faster technology can be realized.

The value of T will be reduced by same factor as R is increased ,,." S & N are not affected.

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

+ Benchmark refers to standard task used to measure how well a processor operates.

* The Performance Measure is the time taken by a computer to execute a given benchmark.

+ SPEC selects & publishes the standard programs along with their test results for different application
domains. (SPEC > System Performance Evaluation Corporation).

+ SPEC rating is given by

Running time on the reference computer

mang = Running time on the computer under test

SPEC rating = 50 > The computer under test is 50 times as fast asreference-computer.
* The test is repeated for all the programs in the SPEC

suite. Then, the geometric mean of the results is

computed.
