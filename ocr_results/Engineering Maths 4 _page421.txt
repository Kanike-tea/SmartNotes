39, A group of 10 boys fed on a diet A and another group of 8 boys ‘fed on'a different diet B for
‘a period of 6 months recorded the following increase in weights (Ibs.)

DitA: 5681124 3.9610

DietB: 2 3 6 8 10 1 2 8
Test whether diets A and B differ significantly regarding their effect on increase in weight.
>> Let the variable x correspond to the diet A and y to the diet B.
