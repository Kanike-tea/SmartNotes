COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

The processor uses one clock cycle to perform one operation as shown in the figure
Clock Cycle > TI T2 T3
Instruction —> Fetch Decode Execute
The performance of the processor depends on the length of the clock cycle. To obtain high
performance reduce the length of the clock cycle. Let ,, P “ be the number of clock cycles generated
by the Processor and ,, R ,, be the Clock rate .

BASIC PERFORMANCE EQUATION

Let ,,T ,,be total time required to execute the program.

Let ,,N ,,be the number of instructions contained in the program.

Let ,,S ,,be the average number of steps required to one instruction.

Let ,,R“ be number, of clock cycles per second generated by the processor to execute one
program.

Processor, Execution Time is given by
T=N*S/R
This equation is called as Basic Performance Equation.
For the programmer the value of T is important. To obtain high performance it is necessary to
reduce theyvalues of N & S and increase the value of R

Performance of a computer can also be measured by using benchmark programs.

SPEC (System Performance Evaluation Corporation) is an non-profitable organization, that
measures performance of computer using SPEC rating. The organization publishes the application
programs and also time taken to execute these programs in standard systems.

SPEC = Running time of reference Computer

Running time of computer under test
