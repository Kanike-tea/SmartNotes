example 3 | Find the edge-connectivity and the vertex-connectivity of the graph shown be-

low:

Figure 4.43

> We note that the removal of any single edge from the given graph does not result in a
disconnected or trivial graph. But, the removal of two edges (for example e} and e4) results in
adisconnected graph. Therefore, the edge-connectivity of the given graph is | two.

Next, we observe that the removal of any single vertex from the given graph does not result
ina disconnected or trival graph. ‘But the removal of two vertices (for cample v1 and va)
sults ina disconnected graph. Therefore, the vertex-connectivity of the given graph is also

two, = 5
