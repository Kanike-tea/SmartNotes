Some decoders are constructed with NAND gates. Since a NAND gate produces the AND operation
with an inverted output, it becomes more economical to generate the decoder minterms in their
complemented form. Furthermore, decoders include one or more enable inputs to control the circuit
operation. A two-to-four-line decoder with an enable input constructed with NAND gates is shown in

Two-to-four-line decoder with enable input

The circuit operates with complemented outputs and a complement enable input. The decoder is enabled
when E is equal to 0 (i.e., active-low enable). As indicated by the truth table, only one output can be
equal to 0 at any given time; all other outputs are equal to 1. The output whose value is equal to 0
represents the minterm selected by inputs A and B. The circuit is disabled when E is equal to 1, regardless
of the values of the other two inputs. When the circuit is disabled, none of the outputs are equal to 0 and
none of the minterms are selected. In general, a decoder may operate with complemented or
uncomplemented outputs. The enable input may be activated with a 0 or with a | signal. Some decoders
have two or more enable inputs that must satisfy a given logic condition in order to enable the circuit.

Decoders with enable inputs can be connected together to form a larger decoder circuit. Figure below
shows two 3-to-8-line decoders with enable inputs connected to form a 4-to-16-line decoder. When w =
0, the top decoder is enabled and the other is disabled. The bottom decoder outputs are all 0’s, and the
top eight outputs generate minterms 0000 to 0111. When w = 1, the enable conditions are reversed: The
bottom decoder outputs generate minterms 1000 to 1111, while the outputs of the top decoder are all
0's.

In general, enable inputs are a convenient feature for interconnecting two or more standard components
for the purpose of combining them into a similar function with more inputs and outputs.
