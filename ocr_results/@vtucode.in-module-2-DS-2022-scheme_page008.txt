CIRCULAR QUEUES USING DYNAMIC ARRAYS
e Adynamically allocated a
e ray is used to hold the queue elements. Let capacity be the number of positions in
the array queue.
e To add an element to a full queue, first increase the size of this array using a

function realloc.

Consider the full queue of figure (a). This figure shows a queue with seven elements in

an array whose capacity is 8. A circular queue is flatten out the array as in Figure (b).

To get a proper circular queue configuration, slide the elements in the right segment (ie.,

elements A and B) to the right end of the array as in figure (d)
