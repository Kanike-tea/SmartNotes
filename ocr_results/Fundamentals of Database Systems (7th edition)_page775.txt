Introduction to Transaction
Processing Concepts
and Theory

‘Tt concept of transaction provides a mechanism
for describing logical units of database processing.
Transaction processing systems are systems with large databases and hundreds of
concurrent users executing database transactions. Examples of such systems
include airline reservations, banking, credit card processing, online retail purchas-
ing, stock markets, supermarket checkouts, and many other applications. These
systems require high availability and fast response time for hundreds of concur-
rent users. In this chapter, we present the concepts that are needed in transaction
processing systems. We define the concept of a transaction, which is used to repre-
sent a logical unit of database processing that must be completed in its entirety to
ensure correctness. A transaction is typically implemented by a computer program
that includes database commands such as retrievals, insertions, deletions, and
updates. We introduced some of the basic techniques for database programming
in Chapters 10 and 11.

In this chapter, we focus on the basic concepts and theory that are needed to ensure
the correct executions of transactions. We discuss the concurrency control prob-
lem, which occurs when multiple transactions submitted by various users interfere
with one another in a way that produces incorrect results. We also discuss the prob-
lems that can occur when transactions fail, and how the database system can recover
from various types of failures.

This chapter is organized as follows. Section 20.1 informally discusses why concur-
rency control and recovery are necessary in a database system. Section 20.2 defines
the term transaction and discusses additional concepts related to transaction
