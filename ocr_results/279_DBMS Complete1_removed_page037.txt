CODD'S RULES

Rule | : The information Rule.

"All information in a relational data base is represented explicitly at the logical level and in exactly
one way - by values in tables."

Everything within the database exists in tables and is accessed via table access routines.

Rule 2 : Guaranteed access Rule.

"Each and every datum (atomic value) in a relational data base is guaranteed to be logically
accessible by resorting to a combination of table name, primary key value and column name."

To access any data-item you specify which column within which table it exists, there is no reading
of characters 10 to 20 of a 255 byte string.

Rule 3 : Systematic treatment of null values.

"Null values (distinct from the empty character string or a string of blank characters and distinct
from zero or any other number) are supported in fully relational DBMS for representing missing
information and inapplicable information in a systematic way, independent of data type."

If data does not exist or does not apply then a value of NULL is applied, this is understood by the
RDBMS as meaning non-applicable data.

Rule 4: Dynamic on-line catalog based on the relational model.

"The data base description is represented at the logical level in the same way as-ordinary data, so
that authorized users can apply the same relational language to its interrogation as they apply to the
regular data."
The Data Dictionary is held within the RDBMS, thus there is no-need for off-line volumes to tell
you the structure of the database.

Rule 5 : Comprehensive data sub-language Rule.

"A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for
example, the fill-in-the-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose
statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings and that is
comprehensive in supporting all the following items

¢ Data Definition

¢ View Definition

¢ Data Manipulation (Interactive and by program).

¢ Integrity Constraints

¢ Authorization.
Every RDBMS should provide a language to allow the user to query the contents of the RDBMS
and also manipulate the contents of the RDBMS.

Rule 6: .View updating Rule

"All views that are theoretically updateable are also updateable by the system."

Not only can the user modify data, but so can the RDBMS when the user is not logged-in.

Rule 7 : High-level insert, update and delete.

"The capability of handling a base relation or a derived relation as a single operand applies not only
to the retrieval of data but also to the insertion, update and deletion of data."

The user should be able to modify several tables by modifying the view to which they act as base
tables.

Rule 8 : Physical data independence.

"Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired whenever any changes
are made in either storage representations or access methods."

The user should not be aware of where or upon which media data-files are stored
