Big Data Technologies Based
on MapReduce and Hadoop'

T* amount of data worldwide has been growing
ever since the advent of the World Wide Web
around 1994, The early search engines—namely, AltaVista (which was acquired by
Yahoo in 2003 and which later became the Yahoo! search engine) and Lycos (which
was also a search engine and a Web portal—were established soon after the Web
came along. They were later overshadowed by the likes of Google and Bing. Then
came an array of social networks such as Facebook, launched in 2004, and Twitter,
founded in 2006. LinkedIn, a professional network launched in 2003, boasts over
250 million users worldwide. Facebook has over 1.3 billion users worldwide today;
of these, about 800 million are active on Facebook daily. Twitter had an estimated
980 million users in early 2014 and it was reported to have reached the rate of 1 bil-
lion tweets per day in October 2012. These statistics are updated continually and
are easily available on the Web.

One major implication of the establishment and exponential growth of the Web,
which brought computing to laypeople worldwide, is that ordinary people started
creating all types of transactions and content that generate new data. These users
and consumers of multimedia data require systems to deliver user-specific data
instantaneously from mammoth stores of data at the same time that they create huge
amounts of data themselves. The result is an explosive growth in the amount of data
generated and communicated over networks worldwide; in addition, businesses and
governmental institutions electronically record every transaction of each customer,
vendor, and supplier and thus have been accumulating data in so-called data ware-
houses (to be discussed in Chapter 29). Added to this mountain of data is the data
