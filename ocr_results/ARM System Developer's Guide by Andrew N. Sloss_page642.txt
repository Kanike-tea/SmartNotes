A.4 ARM Assembler Quick Reference 629

KEEP
KEEP {<symbo1>}

By default the assembler does not include local symbols in the object file, only exported
symbols (see EXPORT). Use KEEP to include all local symbols or a specified local symbol.
This aids the debug view.

LCLA, LCLL, LCLS

These directives declare macro-local arithmetic, logical, and string variables, respectively.
See Section A.4.1.

LTORG

Use LTORG to insert a literal pool. The assembler uses literal pools to store the constants
appearing in the LDR Rd,=<value> instruction. See LDR format 19. Usually the assembler
inserts literal pools automatically, at the end of each area. However, if an area is too large,
then the LDR instruction cannot reach this literal pool using pc-relative addressing. Then
you need to insert a literal pool manually, near the LDR instruction.

MACRO, MEXIT, MEND

Use these directives to declare a new assembler macro or pseudoinstruction. The syntax is

MACRO

{$<arg_0>} <macro_name> {$<arg_1>} {,$<arg_2>} ... {,$<arg_k>}
<macro_code>
MEND

The macro parameters are stored in the dummy variables $<arg_i>. This argument is set
to the empty string if you don’t supply a parameter when calling the macro. The MEXIT
directive terminates the macro early and is usually used inside IF statements. For example,
the following macro defines a new pseudoinstruction SMUL, which evaluates to a SMULBB on
an ARMV5TE processor, and an MUL otherwise.

MACRO
$label SMUL $a, $b, $c
F {ARCHITECTURE}="5TE"
$label  SMULBB $a, $b, $c
MEXIT
ENDIF
$label MUL $a, $b, $c
MEND
