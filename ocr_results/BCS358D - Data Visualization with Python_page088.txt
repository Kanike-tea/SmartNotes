Lab Manual BCS358D-Data Visualization with Python Laboratory

LAB PROGRAM 10 (b)
10 b) Write a Python program for creating Maps using Plotly Libraries.
Aim: Demonstration of working for creating maps using plotly libraries
PROGRAM EXPLANATION

This Python program uses the Pandas library to read data from a CSV file and Plotly Express to
create a choropleth map. Let's break down the program step by step:
1. Import Libraries:
The pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis.
The plotly.express module provides a high-level interface for creating various types of
visualizations, including choropleth maps.
2. Import Data: The program reads a CSV file named '2011_us_ag_exports.csv' from the
specified path and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame called data.
3. Create Choropleth Map:
¢  px.choropleth is a function from Plotly Express used to create a choropleth map.
e The data parameter is set to the DataFrame (data) containing the dataset.
e locations='code': This specifies that the 'code' column in the DataFrame contains
the spatial coordinates or identifiers for the states.
e locationmode="USA-states": Indicates that the data is organized by USA state.
¢ color='total exports': Specifies that the color of each state on the map should be
based on the values in the 'total exports' column of the DataFrame.
© scope="usa": Sets the map scope to the USA.
4. Display the Map: This command displays the choropleth map using the specified
configuration.
Finally, the program reads agricultural export data for the USA from a CSV file, uses Plotly
Express to create a choropleth map, and then displays the map. The color of each state on the

map corresponds to the total exports value from the dataset.
