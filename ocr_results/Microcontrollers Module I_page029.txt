Coprocessors

Coprocessors can be attached to the ARM processor. A coprocessor extends the processing
features of a core by extending the instruction set or by providing configuration registers.
More than one coprocessor can be added to the ARM core via the coprocessor interface. The
coprocessor can be accessed through a group of dedicated ARM instructions that provide a
load-store type interface.

For example, the ARM processor uses coprocessor 15 registers to control the cache, TCMs,
and memory management. The coprocessor can also extend the instruction set by providing a
specialized group of new instructions.

These new instructions are processed in the decode stage of the ARM pipeline. If the decode
stage sees a coprocessor instruction, then it offers it to the relevant coprocessor. But if the
coprocessor is not present or doesn’t recognize the instruction, then the ARM takes an
undefined instruction exception, which allows to emulate the behavior of the coprocessor in

software.
