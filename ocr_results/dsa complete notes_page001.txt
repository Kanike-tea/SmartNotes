Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module-1

For example
int list[5]; // declares an array that can store 5 integers

In C all array index start at 0 and so list[0],list[1],list{2],list[3],list{4] are the names of the five array
elements each of which contains an integer value.

Structures : Structure is basically a user-defined data type that can store related information
thatmay be of same or different data types together.

The major difference between a structure and an array is that an array can store only information of
same data type. A structure is therefore a collection of variables under a single name. The variables
within a structure are of different data types and each has a name that is used to select it from the
structure.

For example,

Struct student {

char sname[10];

int age;

float average_marks;
} st;

It creates a variable whose name is st and that has three fields:

e aname that is a character array
e an integer value representing the age of the student
e afloat value representing the average marks of the individual student.

To assign values to these fields dot operator (. ) is used as the structure member operator. We use
this operator to select a particular member of the structure.

strepy(st.sname," james");
st.age = 10;
st.average_marks = 35;

We can create our own structure data types by using the typedef statement. Consider an example
that creates a structure for the employee details.

typedef struct Employee {
char name[10];
int age;
float salary;

hi
or
typedef struct {
char name[10];
int age;
float salary;
} Employee;
