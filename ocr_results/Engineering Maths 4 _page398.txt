e Chi - Square test as a test of goodness of fit

“it is possible to test the hypothesis about the association of two attributes. We have
already discussed the fitting of Binomial distribution, Normal distribution, Poisson
distribution toa given data. Itis easily possible to find the theoretical frequencies from

the distribution of fit.
. Chi- Square test helps us to test the goodness of fit of these distributions.

If the calculated value of ¢ is less than the table value of ¢ at a specified level of
significance the hypothesis is accepted, otherwise the hypothesis is rejected.

WORKED PROBLEMS

Sampling distribution of the means
1. A population' consists of five numbers 2, 3, 6, 8, 11. Consider all-possible samples
of size 2 which can be drawn with replacement from this population. Find (a) the mean
and $.D of the population. (b) the mean and standard deviation of the sampling
. ‘distribution of means. (c) Considering samples without replacement find the mean
and S.D of the sampling distribution of means.

‘ Y ; 24+34+6+
>> (a) Population mean’ p = 2eSFONSHIL _ g

5

Population variance’ o* = a x (%- ny
xi isl

ie, C= 5 (2-6? (3-6) +(6-6) +(8-6)+(11-6)7}

ae -2 = 108

Thus p= 6 and o = V108

(b) Letus consider all samples of size 2 with replacement. N ='5, m)= 2. Therewill.
be N” ='5* = 25 samples which-are as follows.

(2, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2; 8) (2, 11)
(3, 2) (3, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 11)
