Data Structures and Applications(BCS304) Module 2

The different types of linear linked lists are :
1. Singly linked lists
2. Circular singly linked lists
3. Doubly linked lists
4. Circular doubly linked lists.

Representation of linked list: Each item in the list is called a node and contains two fields
> Information field - The information field holds the actual elements in the list

> Link field- The Link field contains the address of the next node in the list

To create a linked list of integers the node can be defined as follows using a self referential
structure.

Sruct Node

int info;

struct Node * link;

Typedef struct Node NODE;

e The pointer first stores the address of the first node in the list. With this information we
will be able to access the location of all the other nodes in the list.

¢ To obtain a node we use the statement

e First=(node*) malloc(sizeof(node)

e To place the information 5 ,we can use the statement Firs->info= 5;

e As there are no other nodes in the list the link part can be made NULL as follow

e  First->link=NULL

The node created is shown is represented as follows

Firs’. |————>_ [5 -—

Memory allocation and garbage collection

¢ The maintenance of linked lists in memory assumes the possibility of inserting new nodes
into the lists and hence requires some mechanism which provides unused memory space
for the new nodes. Similarly a mechanism is required which makes the deleted node
available for future use.

e Together with the linked list in memory, a special list is maintained which consist of
unused memory cells.

¢ This list which has its own pointer is called the list of available space or the free storage
list or the free pool. Such a list is also called AVAIL
