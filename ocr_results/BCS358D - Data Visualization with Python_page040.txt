9. The program prompts the user to enter a binary number and converts it to decimal using

the binary_to_decimal function. The decimal value

decimal_number and printed.

is stored in the variable

10. Similarly, the program prompts the user to enter an octal number and converts it to

hexadecimal using the octal_to_hexadecimal function. The hexadecimal value is stored in

the variable hexadecimal_number and printed.

By using these conversion functions, you can easily convert binary numbers to decimal and octal

numbers to hexadecimal. The program demonstrates the basic principles of number system

conversion by performing the necessary calculations using loops and arithmetic operations.

PROGRAM

def binary _to_decimal (binary):
decimal = 0
power = 0

def

while binary > 0:
decimal += (binary % 10) * (2 ** power
binary //= 10
power += 1

return decimal

octal_to_hexadecimal (octal):
decimal = 0
power = 0

while octal > 0:
decimal += (octal % 10) * (8 ** power
octal //= 10
power += 1

hexadecimal = "™
hex_digits = "0123456789ABCDEF"

while decimal > 0:

remainder = decimal 16
hexadecimal = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal
decimal //= 16
return hexadecimal
binary number = int(input("Enter a binary number: "))
