Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

Homogeneous DDBMSs use the same DBMS software at all the sites, whereas
heterogeneous DDBMSs can use different DBMS software at each site. It is also
possible to develop middleware software to access several autonomous preexisting
databases stored under heterogeneous DBMSs. This leads to a federated DBMS (or
multidatabase system), in which the participating DBMSs are loosely coupled and
have a degree of local autonomy. Many DDBMSs use client-server architecture, as
we described in Section 2.5.

The fourth criterion is cost. It is difficult to propose a classification of DBMSs
based on cost. Today we have open source (free) DBMS products like MySQL and
PostgreSQL that are supported by third-party vendors with additional services.
The main RDBMS products are available as free examination 30-day copy versions
as well as personal versions, which may cost under $100 and allow a fair amount of
functionality. The giant systems are being sold in modular form with components
to handle distribution, replication, parallel processing, mobile capability, and so
on, and with a large number of parameters that must be defined for the configura-
tion. Furthermore, they are sold in the form of licenses—site licenses allow unlim-
ited use of the database system with any number of copies running at the customer
site. Another type of license limits the number of concurrent users or the number
of user seats at a location. Standalone single-user versions of some systems like
Microsoft Access are sold per copy or included in the overall configuration of a
desktop or laptop. In addition, data warehousing and mining features, as well as
support for additional data types, are made available at extra cost. It is possible to
pay millions of dollars for the installation and maintenance of large database sys-
tems annually.

We can also classify a DBMS on the basis of the types of access path options for
storing files. One well-known family of DBMSs is based on inverted file structures.
Finally, a DBMS can be general purpose or special purpose. When performance is
a primary consideration, a special-purpose DBMS can be designed and built for a
specific application; such a system cannot be used for other applications without
major changes. Many airline reservations and telephone directory systems devel-
oped in the past are special-purpose DBMSs. These fall into the category of online
transaction processing (OLTP) systems, which must support a large number of
concurrent transactions without imposing excessive delays.

Let us briefly elaborate on the main criterion for classifying DBMSs: the data
model. The relational data model represents a database as a collection of tables,
where each table can be stored as a separate file. The database in Figure 1.2 resem-
bles a basic relational representation. Most relational databases use the high-level
query language called SQL and support a limited form of user views. We discuss
the relational model and its languages and operations in Chapters 5 through 8, and
techniques for programming relational applications in Chapters 10 and 11.

The object data model defines a database in terms of objects, their properties, and
their operations. Objects with the same structure and behavior belong to a class,
and classes are organized into hierarchies (or acyclic graphs). The operations of
