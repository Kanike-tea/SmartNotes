integrity constraints, a relational schema can be considered to be a graph structure
(for example, see Figure 3.7). Similarly, the ER model represents data using graph-
like structures (for example, see Figure 7.2). We saw in Chapter 9 that there are
straightforward mappings between the ER and relational models, so we can con-
ceptually represent a relational database schema using the corresponding ER
schema. Although we will use the ER model in our discussion and examples to clar-
ify the conceptual differences between tree and graph models, the same issues apply
to converting relational data to XML.

We will use the simplified UNIVERSITY ER schema shown in Figure 13.8 to illus-
trate our discussion. Suppose that an application needs to extract XML docu-
ments for student, course, and grade information from the UNIVERSITY database.
The data needed for these documents is contained in the database attributes of
the entity types COURSE, SECTION, and STUDENT from Figure 13.8, and the
relationships S-S and C-S between them. In general, most documents extracted
