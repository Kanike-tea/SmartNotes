THE MAP METHOD

10

>

The map method provides a simple, straightforward procedure for
minimizing Boolean functions. This method may be regarded as a pictorial
form of a truth table. The map method is also known as the Karnaugh map or
K-map.

A K-map is a diagram made up of squares, with each square representing one
minterm of the function that is to be minimized.

Since any Boolean function can be expressed as a sum of minterms, it follows
that a Boolean function is recognized graphically in the map from the area
enclosed by those squares whose minterms are included in the function.

Map represents a visual diagram of all possible ways a function may be
expressed in standard form. By recognizing various patterns, the user can derive
alternative algebraic expressions for the same function, from which the simplest
can be selected.
