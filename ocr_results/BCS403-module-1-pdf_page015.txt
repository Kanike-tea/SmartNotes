Database Management System [BCS403]

Currently, eXtended Markup Language (XML) is considered to be the primary standard for
interchanging data among various types of databases and Web pages. XML combines
concepts from the models used in document systems with database modeling concepts.

= Extending Database Capabilities for New Applications

The success of database systems in traditional applications encouraged developers of other
types of applications to attempt to use them. The following are some examples of these
applications:

u Scientific applications that store large amounts of data resulting from

Scientific experiments in areas such as high-energy physics, the mapping of the
human genome, and the discovery of protein structures.

m Storage and retrieval of images, including scanned news or personal
photographs, satellite photographic images, and images from medical
procedures such as x-rays and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging).

= Storage and retrieval of videos, such.as movies, and video clips from news
or personal digital cameras.

u Data mining applications that analyze large amounts of data searching for

the occurrences of specific patterns or relationships, and for identifying
unusual patterns in areas suchas credit card usage.

u Spatial applications that store spatial locations of data, such as weather

information, maps used in geographical information systems, and in
automobile navigational systems.

u Time series applications that store information such as economic data at
tegular points in time, such as daily sales and monthly gross national product

figures.

= Databases versus Information Retrieval

Database technology is heavily used in manufacturing, retail, banking, insurance, finance,
and health care industries, where structured data is collected through forms, such as
invoices or patient registration documents. An area related to database technology is
Information Retrieval (IR), which deals with books, manuscripts, and various forms of
library-based articles. Data is indexed, cataloged, and annotated using keywords. IR is
concerned with searching for material based on these keywords, and with the many

problems dealing with document processing and free-form text processing.
