14.3 Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys

this section on the first three normal forms for relation schemas and the intuition
behind them, and we discuss how they were developed historically. More general
definitions of these normal forms, which take into account all candidate keys of a
relation rather than just the primary key, are deferred to Section 14.4.

We start by informally discussing normal forms and the motivation behind their
development, as well as reviewing some definitions from Chapter 3 that are needed
here. Then we discuss the first normal form (1NF) in Section 14.3.4, and we present
the definitions of second normal form (2NF) and third normal form (3NF), which
are based on primary keys, in Sections 14.3.5 and 14.3.6, respectively.

14.3.1 Normalization of Relations

The normalization process, as first proposed by Codd (1972a), takes a relation
schema through a series of tests to certify whether it satisfies a certain normal form.
The process, which proceeds in a top-down fashion by evaluating each relation
against the criteria for normal forms and decomposing relations as necessary, can
thus be considered as relational design by analysis. Initially, Codd proposed three
normal forms, which he called first, second, and third normal form. A stronger
definition of 3NF—called Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)—was proposed later
by Boyce and Codd. All these normal forms are based on a single analytical tool: the
functional dependencies among the attributes of a relation. Later, a fourth normal
form (4NF) and a fifth normal form (5NF) were proposed, based on the concepts of
multivalued dependencies and join dependencies, respectively; these are briefly dis-
cussed in Sections 14.6 and 14.7.

Normalization of data can be considered a process of analyzing the given relation
schemas based on their FDs and primary keys to achieve the desirable properties of
(1) minimizing redundancy and (2) minimizing the insertion, deletion, and update
anomalies discussed in Section 14.1.2. It can be considered as a “filtering” or “purifi-
cation” process to make the design have successively better quality. An unsatisfactory
relation schema that does not meet the condition for a normal form—the normal
form test—is decomposed into smaller relation schemas that contain a subset of the
attributes and meet the test that was otherwise not met by the original relation. Thus,
the normalization procedure provides database designers with the following:

= A formal framework for analyzing relation schemas based on their keys and
on the functional dependencies among their attributes

= A series of normal form tests that can be carried out on individual relation
schemas so that the relational database can be normalized to any desired
degree

Definition. The normal form of a relation refers to the highest normal form
condition that it meets, and hence indicates the degree to which it has been
normalized.

Normal forms, when considered in isolation from other factors, do not guarantee a
good database design. It is generally not sufficient to check separately that each
