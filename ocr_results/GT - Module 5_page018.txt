2.5.1. Chromatic Polynomials

If 4 colours are used, find in how many ways can this graph be properly coloured?

> Let us redesignate Gz as H. Then, from the definitions of G} and G;*, we find that He=G

and H’ = G}*. Now, applying the decomposition theorem to H, we get
P(H,, a) = P(H, A) + P(Hi,a)

This is the same as
P(G, A) = P(G{, A) + P(G3*, A)

which is the required result.
For the graph G shown in Figure 2.58, if e = {v2, v4}, the graphs G? and G;* are as shown

We note that G} is Ky and Gz* is K3. Therefore,

P(G}.A) = P(K,a) = A= 1A = 2(a—
and P(G¢*, a) = P(K3,a) = (A= 1\(a-
