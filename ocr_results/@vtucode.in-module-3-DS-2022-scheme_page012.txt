The above tree example can be represented using List representation as follows...

2. Left Child - Right Sibling Representation

In this representation, we use list with one type of node which consists of three fields namely
Data field, Left child reference field and Right sibling reference field.

To convert the tree of Figure (A) into this representation:
1. First note that every.node has at most one leftmost child
2. At most one closest right sibling.

e In Figure (A), the leftmost child of A is B, and, the leftmost child of D is H.

e The closest right sibling of B is C, and the closest right sibling of H is I.

© Choose the nodes based on how the tree is drawn. The left child field of each node points
to its leftmost child (if any), and the right sibling field points to its closest right
sibling (if any).

e Figure (D) shows the tree of Figure (A) redrawn using the left child-right sibling
