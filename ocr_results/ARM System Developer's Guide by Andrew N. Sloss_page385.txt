372 Chapter 10 Firmware

=) Flash ROM memory management—provides a set of filing system routines that can
download, update, and erase images in flash ROM. In addition, the images can either
be compressed or uncompressed.

= Full operating system support—supports the loading and booting of Embedded Linux,
Red Hat eCos, and many other popular operating systems. For Embedded Linux,
RedBoot supports the ability to define parameters that are passed directly to the kernel
upon booting.

10.2 EXAMPLE: SANDSTONE

We have designed Sandstone to be a minimal system. It carries out only the following tasks:
set up target platform environment, load a bootable image into memory, and relinquish
control to an operating system. It is, however, still a real working example.

The implementation is specific to the ARM Evaluator-7T platform, which includes an
ARM7TDMI processor. This example shows you exactly how a simple platform can be set
up and a software payload can be loaded into memory and booted. The payload can either
be an application or operating system image. Sandstone is a static design and cannot be
configured after the build process is complete. Table 10.2 lists the basic characteristics of
Sandstone.

We will walk you through the directory layout and code structure. The directory layout
shows you where the source code is located and where the different build files are placed.
The code structure focuses more on the actual initialization and boot process.

Note that Sandstone is written entirely in ARM assembler and is a working piece of code
that can be used to intialize target hardware and boot any piece of software, within reason,
on the ARM Evaluator-7T.

10.2.1 SANDSTONE DIRECTORY LAYOUT

Sandstone can be found on our Web site. If you take a look at Sandstone, you will see that
the directory structure is as shown in Figure 10.1. The structure follows a standard style
