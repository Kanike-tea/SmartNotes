An overflow cannot occur after an addition if one number is positive and the other is negative, since
adding a positive number to a negative number produces a result whose magnitude is smaller than the
larger of the two original numbers. An overflow may occur if the two numbers added are both positive
or both negative.

Consider the following example: Two signed binary numbers, +70 and +80, are stored in two eight-bit
registers. The range of numbers that each register can accommodate is from binary +127 to binary -128.
Since the sum of the two numbers is +150, it exceeds the capacity of an eight-bit register. This is also
true for -70 and -80.

carries: 01 carries: 10
+70 0 1000110 -70 1 0111010
+80 0 1010000 80 1 0110000
+150 1 0010110 150 0 1101010

Note that the eight-bit result that should have been positive has a negative sign bit (i.e., the eighth bit)
and the eight-bit result that should have been negative has a positive sign bit. If, however, the carry out
of the sign bit position is taken as the sign bit of the result, then the nine-bit answer so obtained will be
correct. But since the answer cannot be accommodated within eight bits, we say that an overflow has
occurred.

Decoders

A decoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information from n input lines to a maximum
of 2n unique output lines. If the n -bit coded information has unused combinations, the decoder may
have fewer than 2n outputs. The decoders presented here are called n -to- m -line decoders, wherem s

2n. Their purpose is to generate the 2n (or fewer) minterms of n input variables. Each combination of
inputs will assert a unique output. The name decoder is also used in conjunction with other code
converters, such as a BCD-to-seven-segment decoder.

As an example, consider the three-to-eight-line decoder circuit of Fig below. The three inputs are
decoded into eight outputs, each representing one of the minterms of the three input variables. The three
inverters provide the complement of the inputs, and each one of the eight AND gates generates one of
the minterms. A particular application of this decoder is binary-to-octal conversion. The input variables
represent a binary number, and the outputs represent the eight digits of a number in the octal number
system. However, a three-to-eight-line decoder can be used for decoding any three-bit code to provide
eight outputs, one for each element of the code.

The operation of the decoder may be clarified by the truth table listed in Table above. For each possible
input combination, there are seven outputs that are equal to 0 and only one that is equal to 1. The output
whose value is equal to 1 represents the minterm equivalent of the binary number currently available in
the input lines.
