* The Store operation transfers the information from the register to the specified memory-location.
This will destroy the original contents of that memory-location.

* Steps for Store operation are:

ssor sends the address of the memory-location where it wants to store data.

r issues ,,write’ signal to memory to store the data.

3) Content of register(MDR) is written into the specified memory-location

INSTRUCTIONS & INSTRUCTION SEQUENCING
+ A computer must have instructions capable of performing 4 types of operations:
1) Data transfers between the memory and the registers (MOV, PUSH, POP, XCHG).
2) Arithmetic and logic operations on data (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, NOT).
3) Program sequencing and control (CALL.RET, LOOP, INT).
4) V/O transfers (IN, OUT).

REGISTER TRANSFER NOTATION (RTN)
The possible locations in which transfer of information occurs are:

1) Memory-location 2) Processor register 3) Registers in I/O device.
Location Hardware Binary Example Description
Address

Memory LOC, PLACE, NUM RI € [LOC] Contents of memory-location LOC
are transferred into register R1.

Processor RO,R1 .R2 [R3] € [R1]+[R2] Add the contents of register RI &R2
and places their sum into R3.

I/O Registers DATAIN, DATAOUT | RI € DATAIN Contents of I/O register DATAIN are
transferred into register R1.

ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE NOTATION
To represent machine instructions and programs, assembly language format is used.
Assembly Language Format Description
Move LOC, R1 Transfer data from memory-location LOC to register R1. The
contents of LOC
are unchanged by the execution of this instruction, but the
old contents of register R1 are overwritten.
Add R1, R2, R3 Add the contents of registers R1 and R2, and places their sum into
register R3.
