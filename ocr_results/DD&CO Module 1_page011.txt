Three-Variable K-Map

A three-variable K-map is shown in Fig. 3.3 . There are eight minterms for three binary variables;
therefore, the map consists of eight squares. Note that the minterms are arranged, not in a binary
sequence, but in a sequence similar to the Gray code. The characteristic of this sequence is that only one
bit changes in value from one adjacent column to the next. For example, the square assigned to m5
corresponds to row | and column 01. When these two numbers are concatenated, they give the binary

number 101 (m5 = xy'z), whose decimal equivalent is 5.

Four Variable K-Map

The map for Boolean functions of four binary variables (w, x, y, z) is shown in Fig(a) listed the 16
minterms and the squares assigned to each. In Fig(b), the map is redrawn to show the relationship
between the squares and the four variables. The rows and columns are numbered in a Gray code

sequence, with only one digit changing value between two adjacent rows or columns. The minterm
