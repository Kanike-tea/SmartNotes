Let G be a graph and e = {a,b} be an edge in G. Let G. = G-e be that Subgraph of g
which is obtained by deleting e from G without deleting vertices a and b. Suppose we Construct

a new graph Gi, by coalescing (identifying/merging) the vertices @ and b in G,. Then Grisa
subgraph of G, as well as of G.

The process of obtaining G, and Gi, from G is illustrated in Figure 2.46.

The following theorem known

as the Decomposition Theorem for Chromatic Polynomials
Blves an expression for P(G

+A) in terms of P(Gp, a) and P(G{, A) for a connected graph G.

Theorem 1. IfG is a connected graph and e = (a, b} is an edge in G, then
