always statement.) In this case, these variables are the input variables A, B, and select. The statements
execute if A, B, or select changes value. Note that the keyword or, instead of the bitwise logical OR
operator “|”, is used between variables. The conditional statement if-else provides a decision based upon
the value of the select input.

Synchronous Sequential Logic

Hand-held devices, cell phones, navigation receivers, personal computers, digital cameras, personal
media players, and virtually all electronic consumer products have the ability to send, receive, store,
retrieve, and process information represented in a binary format. The technology enabling and
supporting these devices is critically dependent on electronic components that can store information,
i.e., have memory. m. The digital circuits considered thus far have been combinational—their output
depends only and immediately on their inputs—they have no memory, i.e., dependence on past values
of their inputs. Sequential circuits, however, act as storage elements and have memory. They can store,
retain, and then retrieve information when needed later.

Sequential Circuits

A block diagram of a sequential circuit is shown in Fig below. It consists of a combinational circuit to
which storage elements are connected to form a feedback path. The storage elements are devices capable
of storing binary information. The binary information stored in these elements at any given time defines
the state of the sequential circuit at that time. The sequential circuit receives binary information from
external inputs that, together with the present state of the storage elements, determine the binary value
of the outputs. These external inputs also determine the condition for changing the state in the storage
elements. The block diagram demonstrates that the outputs in a sequential circuit are a function not only
