HBOCs have a tendency to scavenge nitric oxide, a molecule important for regulating blood
vessel dilation and maintaining normal blood flow. Excessive nitric oxide scavenging by
HBOCs can lead to vasoconstriction, impairing blood flow to vital organs and potentially
causing adverse cardiovascular effects.

Renal toxicity:

Some HBOCs have shown a potential for renal toxicity, causing damage to the kidneys.
This can be a significant concern as the kidneys play a crucial role in filtering and
excreting waste products from the body.

Immunogenicity and adverse reactions:

HBOCs can trigger immune responses in the body, potentially leading to allergic reactions
or other adverse events. Immunogenicity can vary between different HBOC products and
individuals, and careful monitoring is necessary to identify and manage any potential
adverse reactions.

Regulatory challenges:

HBOCs are subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny due to their potential risks and complex
nature. Obtaining regulatory approval for HBOCs can be a lengthy and costly process, and
several HBOC products have faced setbacks in their development due to safety concerns.

Interference with diagnostic tests:

HBOCs can interfere with certain laboratory tests, such as those measuring bilirubin or liver
enzymes. This interference can complicate the interpretation of results and potentially lead
to diagnostic errors.

Examples of HBOCs

There are several examples of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) that have been
developed or are currently in development. Here are a few examples:

e Hemopure: Hemopure is an HBOC that is made from bovine hemoglobin. It has been approved
for use in South Africa, Russia, and some other countries.

e Oxyglobin: Oxyglobin is another HBOC that is made from bovine hemoglobin. It is approved
for veterinary use in the United States and has been used to treat anemia in dogs.

e Hemospan: Hemospan is an HBOC that is being developed by Sangart Inc. It is currently in
clinical trials and has shown promise in increasing oxygen delivery to tissues.

e MP40X: MP4OX is an HBOC that is being developed by Baxter Healthcare. It is designedto
increase oxygen delivery to tissues and also to scavenge harmful free radicals in the
bloodstream.

e Hemolink: Hemolink is an HBOC that is being developed by Hemosol Inc. It is designed tobe
used in trauma and surgical settings and has shown promise in improving oxygen delivery to
tissues.

(Note: Many countries have not yet given regulatory approval for clinical usage of HBOCs)
