B*-tree insertion with left redistribution.

consulted for search, insertion, and deletion algorithms for B-trees and B*-trees.
Larson (1981) analyzes index-sequential files, and Held and Stonebraker (1978)
compare static multilevel indexes with B-tree dynamic indexes. Lehman and Yao
(1981) and Srinivasan and Carey (1991) did further analysis of concurrent access to
B-trees. The books by Wiederhold (1987), Smith and Barnes (1987), and Salzberg
(1988), among others, discuss many of the search techniques described in this
chapter. Grid files are introduced in Nievergelt et al. (1984). Partial-match retrieval,
which uses partitioned hashing, is discussed in Burkhard (1976, 1979).

New techniques and applications of indexes and B*-trees are discussed in Lanka
and Mays (1991), Zobel et al. (1992), and Faloutsos and Jagadish (1992). Mohan
