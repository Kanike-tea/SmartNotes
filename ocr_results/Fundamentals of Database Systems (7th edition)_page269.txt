The Relational Algebra and
Relational Calculus

n this chapter we discuss the two formal languages for

the relational model: the relational algebra and the
relational calculus. In contrast, Chapters 6 and 7 described the practical language
for the relational model, namely the SQL standard. Historically, the relational alge-
bra and calculus were developed before the SQL language. SQL is primarily based
on concepts from relational calculus and has been extended to incorporate some
concepts from relational algebra as well. Because most relational DBMSs use SQL
as their language, we presented the SQL language first.

Recall from Chapter 2 that a data model must include a set of operations to
manipulate the database, in addition to the data model’s concepts for defining the
database’s structure and constraints. We presented the structures and constraints
of the formal relational model in Chapter 5. The basic set of operations for the
formal relational model is the relational algebra. These operations enable a user
to specify basic retrieval requests as relational algebra expressions. The result of a
retrieval query is a new relation. The algebra operations thus produce new rela-
tions, which can be further manipulated using operations of the same algebra. A
sequence of relational algebra operations forms a relational algebra expression,
whose result will also be a relation that represents the result of a database query
(or retrieval request).

The relational algebra is very important for several reasons. First, it provides a
formal foundation for relational model operations. Second, and perhaps more
important, it is used as a basis for implementing and optimizing queries in the
query processing and optimization modules that are integral parts of relational
database management systems (RDBMSs), as we shall discuss in Chapters 18
and 19. Third, some of its concepts are incorporated into the SQL standard
