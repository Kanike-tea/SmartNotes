+ Anew stack-frame is then

— created for the invoked-function &

— placed on top of the system-stack
+ When this function terminates, its stack-frame is removed (and processing of the invoking-
function, which is again on top of the stack, continues).

+ Frame-pointer(fp) is a pointer to the current stack-frame.

ARRAY REPRESENTATION OF STACKS

e Stacks may be represented in the computer in various ways such as one-way
linked list (Singly linked list) or linear array.

e Stacks are maintained by the two variables such as TOP and MAX_STACK_ SIZE.

¢ TOP which contains the location of the top element in the stack. If TOP=-1,
then it indicates stack is empty.

e MAX_STACK_ SIZE which gives maximum number of elements that can be
stored in stack.

Stack can represented using linear array as shown below
