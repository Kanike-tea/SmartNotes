© — To find the derivative of f(z) we make.use of the fundamental results derived
while establishing C-R equations. They are as follows. :

f(z)su,tio | [Cartesian form]

f(zZ= ei (u,+i0,) — [Polar form]

e We Trans for the partial derivatives and rearrange as a function of (x+iy) “

or ré® whichisz, with the result f(z) is obtained as a function of z.

1. Show that w = z + é° is analytic and hence find &
>> By data w=z+é
ie, utiv=(xtiy) + &*tiy)
= (xtiy) + &-e¥
= (x+iy)+ e* (cosy + isiny)
ie, uUtiv=(x+e cosy) +i(yt+esiny)
u=x +t ecosy v=ytesiny
u, = 1+ & cosy v, = &siny
uy =~ siny v, = 1+ cosy
We observe that Cauchy-Riemann equations in the cartesian form Hy = Vy and
v, = —uy are satisfied.
Thus w=z+t é is analytic

Also we have =z = f'(z) =u, tiv,
