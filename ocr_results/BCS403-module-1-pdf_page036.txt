Database Management System [BCS403]

Attributes that are not divisible are called simple or atomic attributes. Example SSN of an

employee.

2. Single-Valued versus Multivalued Attributes

Attributes that have a single value for a particular entity are called single-valued. For example,
Age is a single-valued attribute of a person.

Attributes that can have a set of values for a particular entity are called Multivalued Attributes.
For example Colors attribute for a car, or a College_degrees attribute for a person. A multivalued
attribute may have lower and upper bounds to constrain the number of values allowed for each
individual entity. For example, the Colors attribute of a car may be restricted to have between one

and three values, if we assume that a car can have three colors at most.

3. Stored versus Derived Attributes
An attribute, which cannot be derived from other attribute are called stored attribute. For
example, Birth_Date of an employee
Attributes derived from other stored attributesare called derived attribute. For example age of an

employee can be determined from the current (today’s) date and Date of Birth

4, Null Value Attribute(Optional Attribute)
In some cases, a particular entity may not have an applicable value for an attribute. For example,
the Apartment number attribute of an address applies only to addresses that are in apartment
buildings and not to other types of residences, such as single-family homes. Similarly, a
College_degrees attribute applies only to people with college degrees. For such situations, a
special value called NULL is created. An address of a single-family home would have NULL for
its Apartment_number attribute, and a person with no college degree would have NULL for
College_degrees. NULL can also be used if we do not know the value of an attribute for a

particular entity

5. Complex Attributes

If an attribute for an entity, is built using composite and multivalued attributes, then these
attributes are called complex attributes. For example, a person can have more than one residence
and each residence can have multiple phones, an addressphone for a person entity can be specified

as:

{ Addressphone (phone {(Area Code, Phone Number)},
