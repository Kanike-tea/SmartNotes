Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts

which contains values that are results from a series of n tests for one patient. The
target variable that we wish to predict is P, the probability of survival of the patient.
Then the rule for regression takes the form:

(test 1 in range) and (test 2 in range.) and ... (test n in range,,) = P =x,
orx<P<y

The choice depends on whether we can predict a unique value of P or a range of
values for P. If we regard P as a function:

P=f (test 1, test 2, ..., test n)

the function is called a regression function to predict P. In general, if the function
appears as

Y=f (Xp Xy Xn)»

and fis linear in the domain variables x;, the process of deriving f from a given set of
tuples for <Xj, X, ... , X;, y> is called linear regression. Linear regression is a com-
monly used statistical technique for fitting a set of observations or points in n
dimensions with the target variable y.

Regression analysis is a very common tool for analysis of data in many research
domains. The discovery of the function to predict the target variable is equivalent to
a data mining operation.

28.5.4 Neural Networks

A neural network is a technique derived from artificial intelligence research that
uses generalized regression and provides an iterative method to carry it out. Neural
networks use the curve-fitting approach to infer a function from a set of samples.
This technique provides a learning approach; it is driven by a test sample that is
used for the initial inference and learning. With this kind of learning method,
responses to new inputs may be able to be interpolated from the known samples.
This interpolation, however, depends on the world model (internal representation
of the problem domain) developed by the learning method.

Neural networks can be broadly classified into two categories: supervised and unsu-
pervised networks. Adaptive methods that attempt to reduce the output error are
supervised learning methods, whereas those that develop internal representations
without sample outputs are called unsupervised learning methods.

Neural networks self-adapt; that is, they learn from information about a specific
problem. They perform well on classification tasks and are therefore useful in data
mining. Yet they are not without problems. Although they learn, they do not pro-
vide a good representation of what they have learned. Their outputs are highly
quantitative and not easy to understand. As another limitation, the internal repre-
sentations developed by neural networks are not unique. Also, in general, neural
networks have trouble modeling time series data. Despite these shortcomings, they
are popular and frequently used by several commercial vendors.
