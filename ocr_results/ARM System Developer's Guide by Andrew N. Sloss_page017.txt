1.1 THE RISC DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Figure 1.1

The ARM core uses a RISC architecture. RISC is a design philosophy aimed at delivering
simple but powerful instructions that execute within a single cycle at a high clock speed.
The RISC philosophy concentrates on reducing the complexity of instructions performed
by the hardware because it is easier to provide greater flexibility and intelligence in software
rather than hardware. As a result, a RISC design places greater demands on the compiler.
In contrast, the traditional complex instruction set computer (CISC) relies more on the
hardware for instruction functionality, and consequently the CISC instructions are more
complicated. Figure 1.1 illustrates these major differences.

The RISC philosophy is implemented with four major design rules:

. Instructions—RISC processors have a reduced number of instruction classes. These

classes provide simple operations that can each execute in a single cycle. The compiler
or programmer synthesizes complicated operations (for example, a divide operation)
by combining several simple instructions. Each instruction is a fixed length to allow
the pipeline to fetch future instructions before decoding the current instruction. In
contrast, in CISC processors the instructions are often of variable size and take many
cycles to execute.

. Pipeline-—The processing of instructions is broken down into smaller units that can be

executed in parallel by pipelines. Ideally the pipeline advances by one step on each cycle
for maximum throughput. Instructions can be decoded in one pipeline stage. There is
no need for an instruction to be executed by a miniprogram called microcode as on
CISC processors.

. Registers—RISC machines have a large general-purpose register set. Any register can

contain either data or an address. Registers act as the fast local memory store for all data
