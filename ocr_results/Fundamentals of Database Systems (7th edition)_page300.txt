Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus

In tuple relational calculus, we first specify the requested attributes t.Bdate and
t.Address for each selected tuple t. Then we specify the condition for selecting a tuple
following the bar (|)—namely, that f be a tuple of the EMPLOYEE relation whose
Frame, Minit, and Lname attribute values are ‘John’, ‘B’, and ‘Smith’, respectively.

8.6.2 Expressions and Formulas in Tuple Relational Calculus
A general expression of the tuple relational calculus is of the form
{ty Ajp to-Afy os by-Am | COND( thy toy «5 bs bass ny2s => nvm) }

where fy, f, ... 5 tn tnvis --- » fry are tuple variables, each A; is an attribute of the
relation on which f; ranges, and COND is a condition or formula’ of the tuple rela-
tional calculus. A formula is made up of predicate calculus atoms, which can be one
of the following:

1. An atom of the form R(t;), where R is a relation name and {; is a tuple vari-
able. This atom identifies the range of the tuple variable f; as the relation
whose name is R. It evaluates to TRUE if f; is a tuple in the relation R, and
evaluates to FALSE otherwise.

2. An atom of the form £;.A op ;.B, where op is one of the comparison opera-
tors in the set {=, <, <, >, >, #}, t; and t; are tuple variables, A is an attribute
of the relation on which f; ranges, and B is an attribute of the relation on
which #; ranges.

3. Anatom of the form ¢;.A op c or c op 1.B, where op is one of the comparison
operators in the set {=, <, <, >, 2, #}, ¢; and #; are tuple variables, A is an attri-
bute of the relation on which 1; ranges, B is an attribute of the relation on
which #; ranges, and c is a constant value.

Each of the preceding atoms evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE for a specific combi-
nation of tuples; this is called the truth value of an atom. In general, a tuple variable
t ranges over all possible tuples in the universe. For atoms of the form R(t), if t is
assigned to a tuple that is a member of the specified relation R, the atom is TRUE;
otherwise, it is FALSE. In atoms of types 2 and 3, if the tuple variables are assigned
to tuples such that the values of the specified attributes of the tuples satisfy the con-
dition, then the atom is TRUE.

A formula (Boolean condition) is made up of one or more atoms connected via
the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT and is defined recursively by Rules 1 and 2
as follows:

= Rule 1: Every atom isa formula.

= Rule 2: If F, and F are formulas, then so are (F; AND Fy), (F; OR F)), NOT
(F,), and NOT (F)). The truth values of these formulas are derived from their
component formulas F; and F) as follows:

'S,lso called a well-formed formula, or WEF, in mathematical logic.
