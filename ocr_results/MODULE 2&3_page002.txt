SMULxy “5 signed multiply instructions (16 x 16

SMULKY signed multiply instruction ((32 x 16)

sTc stc2 v2 store to memory single or multiple 32-bit values from coprocessor
s™ vl store multiple 32-bit registers to memory

STR vl v4 vSE store register to a virtual address in memory

SUB vi subtract two 32-bit values

SWI vl software interrupt

SMP vla swap a word/byte in memory with a register, without interruption
TEQ vi test for equality of two 32-bit values

TST vi test for bits in a 32-bit value

UMLAL v3M unsigned multiply accumulate long ((32 x 32) + 64 = 64-bit)
UMULL v3M unsigned multiply long (32 x 32 = 64-bit)

2. Data Processing Instructions

The data processing instructions manipulate data within registers. They are move
instructions, arithmetic instructions, logical instructions, comparison instructions, and
multiply instructions. Most data processing instructions can process one of their operands

using the barrel shifter.

If you use the S suffix on a data processing instruction, then it updates the flags in the cpsr.
Move and logical operations update the carry flag C, negative flag N, and zero flag Z. The
carry flag is set from the result of the barrel shift as the last bit shifted out. The N flag is set to

bit 31 of the result. The Z flag is set if the result is zero.
2.1 MOVE Instructions

Move is the simplest ARM instruction. It copies N into a destination register Rd, where N is a
register (Rm) or immediate value (#). This instruction is useful for setting initial values and

transferring data between registers.

Syntax: <instruction>{<cond>}{S} Rd, N

MOV Move a 32-bit value into a register Rd=N

it value into a register

Example:
MOV 17,15 ; copies the content of r5 to r7 register

PRE: 15 =5,17=8 POST : 15 =5,1r7=5
