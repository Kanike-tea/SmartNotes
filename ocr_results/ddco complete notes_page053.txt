feature not available in other gates. Because of this feature, a large number of three-state
gate outputs can be connected with wires to form a common line without endangering
loading effects.

° The construction of multiplexers with three-state buffers is demonstrated in Fig. 4.30
. Figure 4.30(a) shows the construction of a two-to-one-line multiplexer with 2 three-state
buffers and an inverter. The two outputs are connected together to form a single output
line. (Note that this type of connection cannot be made with gates that do not have three-
state outputs.) When the select input is 0, the upper buffer is enabled by its control input
and the lower buffer is disabled. Output Y is then equal to input A . When the select input
is 1, the lower buffer is enabled and Y is equal toB .

HDL models of combinational circuits

* The logic of a module can be described in any one (or a combination) of the following
modeling styles:

¢ Behavioral modeling using procedural assignment statements with the keyword always.

e Gate-level (structural) modeling describes a circuit by specifying its gates and how
they are connected with each other. Gate-level modeling using instantiations of
predefined and user-defined primitive gates

¢ Dataflow modeling is used mostly for describing the Boolean equations of
combinational logic, Dataflow modeling using continuous assignment statements with
the keyword assign.
