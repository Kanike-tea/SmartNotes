Figure Below shows a directory less hash table ht with r=2 and q=0. The number of active bucket is

r=2, q=0

When we insert CS into the table, chain 01 is examined and we verify that C5 is not present. Since the
active bucket for the searched chain is full we get an overflow. An overflow is handled by activating
bucker 2'+q, reallocating the entries in the chain q then the value of q is incremented by | incase q
becomes 2". We increment r by | and reset q to 0. The reallocation is done usingh(k.1+1). Finally the
new pair is inserted into the chain.
