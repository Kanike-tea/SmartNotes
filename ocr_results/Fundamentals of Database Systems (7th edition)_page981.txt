are used primarily for analytics applications. These concerns include the
following:

= Heterogeneity of information: Heterogeneity in terms of data types, data
formats, data representation, and semantics is unavoidable when it comes to
sources of data. One of the phases in the big data life cycle involves integra-
tion of this data. The cost of doing a clean job of integration to bring all data
into a single structure is prohibitive for most applications, such as health-
care, energy, transportation, urban planning, and environmental modeling.
Most machine learning algorithms expect data to be fed into them in a uni-
form structure. The data provenance (which refers to the information about
the origin and ownership of data) is typically not maintained in most analyt-
ics applications. Proper interpretation of data analysis results requires large
amounts of metadata.

= Privacy and confidentiality: Regulations and laws regarding protection of
confidential information are not always available and hence not applied
strictly during big data analysis. Enforcement of HIPAA regulations in the
healthcare environment is one of few instances where privacy and confiden-
tiality are strictly enforced. Location-based applications (such as on smart
phones and other GPS-equipped devices), logs of user transactions, and
clickstreams that capture user behavior all reveal confidential information.
User movement and buying patterns can be tracked to reveal personal iden-
tity. Because it is now possible to harness and analyze billions of users’ records
via the technologies described in this chapter, there is widespread concern
about personal information being compromised (e.g., data about individuals
could be leaked from social data networks that are in some way linked to
other data networks). Data about customers, cardholders, and employees is
held by organizations and thus is subject to breaches of confidentiality. Jag-
adish et al. (2014) voiced a need for stricter control over digital rights man-
agement of data similar to the control exercised in the music industry.

= Need for visualization and better human interfaces: Huge volumes of data
are crunched by big data systems, and the results of analyses must be inter-
preted and understood by humans. Human preferences must be accounted
for and data must be presented in a properly digestible form. Humans are
experts at detecting patterns and have great intuition about data they are
familiar with. Machines cannot match humans in this regard. It should be
possible to bring together multiple human experts to share and interpret
results of analysis and thereby increase understanding of those results. Mul-
tiple modes of visual exploration must be possible to make the best use of
data and to properly interpret results that are out of range and thus are clas-
sified as outlier values.

= Inconsistent and incomplete information: This has been a perennial prob-
Jem in data collection and management. Future big data systems will allow
multiple sources to be handled by multiple coexisting applications, so prob-
Jems due to missing data, erroneous data, and uncertain data will be com-
pounded. The large volume and built-in redundancy of data in fault-tolerant
