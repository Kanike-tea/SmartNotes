Encoders

An encoder is a digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of a decoder. An encoder has 2n (or
fewer) input lines and n output lines. The output lines, as an aggregate, generate the binary code
corresponding to the input value. An example of an encoder is the octal-to-binary encoder whose truth
table is given in Table

It has eight inputs (one for each of the octal digits) and three outputs that generate the corresponding
binary number. It is assumed that only one input has a value of | at any given time.

The encoder defined in Table above has the limitation that only one input can be active at any given
time. If two inputs are active simultaneously, the output produces an undefined combination. For
example, if D3 and D6 are | simultaneously, the output of the encoder will be 111 because all three
outputs are equal to 1. The output 111 does not represent either binary 3 or binary 6. To resolve this
ambiguity, encoder circuits must establish an input priority to ensure that only one input is encoded. If
we establish a higher priority for inputs with higher subscript numbers, and if both D3 and D6 are | at
the same time, the output will be 110 because D6 has higher priority than D3.

Priority Encoder

A priority encoder is an encoder circuit that includes the priority function. The operation of the priority
encoder is such that if two or more inputs are equal to | at the same time, the input having the highest
priority will take precedence. The truth table of a four-input priority encoder is given in Table. In addition
to the two outputs x and y , the circuit has a third output designated by V ; this is a valid bit indicator
that is set to 1 when one or more inputs are equal to 1. If all inputs are 0, there is no valid input and V is
equal to 0. The other two outputs are not inspected when V equals 0 and are specified as don’t-care
conditions. Note that whereas X ’s in output columns represent don’t-care conditions, the X ’s in the
input columns are useful for representing a truth table in condensed form. Instead of listing all 16
minterms of four variables, the truth table uses an X to represent either 1 or 0. For example, X 100
represents the two minterms 0100 and 1100.
