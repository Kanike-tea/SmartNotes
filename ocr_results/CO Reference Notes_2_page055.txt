Hit Rate & Miss Penalty
¢ The number of hits stated as a fraction of all attempted accesses is called the Hit Rate.
¢ The extra time needed to bring the desired information into the cache is called the Miss Penalty.
¢ High hit rates well over 0.9 are essential for high-performance computers.
© Performance is adversely affected by the actions that need to be taken when a miss occurs.
¢ A performance penalty is incurred because
of the extra time needed to bring a block of data from a slower unit to a faster unit.
¢ During that period, the processor is stalled waiting for instructions or data.
© We refer to the total access time seen by the processor when a miss occurs as the miss penalty.
Let h be the hit rate, M the miss penalty, and C the time to access information in the cache. Thus, the
average access time experienced by the processor is
tavg = hC + (1 —h)M

VIRTUAL MEMORY
¢ It refers to a technique that automatically move program/data blocks into the main-memory when they are
required for execution (Figure 8.24).
© The address generated by the processor is referred to as a virtual/logical address.
© The virtual-address is translated into physical-address by MMU (Memory Management Unit).
© During every memory-cycle, MMU determines whether the addressed-word is in the memory. If
the word is in memory.
Then, the word is accessed and execution proceeds.
Otherwise, a page containing desired word is transferred from disk to memory.
« Using DMA scheme, transfer of data between disk and memory is performed.
