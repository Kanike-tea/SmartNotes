Analysis: Let n be length of the infix string. ©(n) time is spent extracting tokens . There are two while
loop where the total time spent is @(n) since the number of to!

linear in n . So the complexity of the function is O(n)

Evaluating a postfix expression

Each operator in a postfix string refers to the previous two operands in the string. If we are parsing a
string, each time we read operands we push it to the stack and when we read a operator, its operands

will be the two topmost elements in the stack. We can then
It back to t

indicated operation and push the resu

Is and perform the

e stack so that it can be used by the next operator.
