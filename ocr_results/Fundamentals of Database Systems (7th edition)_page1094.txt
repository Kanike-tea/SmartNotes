1064 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

We started in Section 27.1 by first introducing the field of IR in section 27.1.1 and
comparing IR and database technologies in Section 27.1.2. A brief history of IR was
presented in Section 27.1.3, and the query and browsing modes of interaction in IR
systems were introduced in Section 27.1.4.

We presented in Section 27.2 the various retrieval models used in IR, including
Boolean, vector space, probabilistic, and semantic models. These models allow us to
measure whether a document is relevant to a user query and provide similarity
measurement heuristics. In Section 27.3 we presented different types of queries—in
addition to keyword-based queries, which dominate, there are other types, includ-
ing Boolean, phrase, proximity, natural language, and others for which explicit sup-
port needs to be provided by the retrieval model. Text preprocessing is important in
IR systems, and we discussed in Section 27.4 various activities like stopword
removal, stemming, and the use of thesauruses. We then discussed the construction
and use of inverted indexes in Section 27.5, which are at the core of IR systems and
contribute to factors involving search efficiency. We then discussed in Section 27.6
various evaluation metrics, such as recall precision and F-score, to measure the
goodness of the results of IR queries. The Lucene open source indexing and search
engine and its extension called Solr was discussed. Relevance feedback was briefly
addressed—it is important to modify and improve the retrieval of pertinent infor-
mation for the user through his interaction and engagement in the search process.

We provided in Section 27.7 a somewhat detailed introduction to analysis of the Web
as it relates to information retrieval. We divided this treatment into the analysis of
content, structure, and usage of the Web. Web search was discussed, including an
analysis of the Web link structure (Section 27.7.3), including an introduction to algo-
rithms for ranking the results from a Web search such as PageRank and HITS. Finally,
we briefly discussed current trends, including faceted search, social search, and con-
versational search. We also presented probabilistic modeling of topics of documents
and a popular technique called latent Dirichlet allocation. We ended the chapter with
a discussion of question answering systems (Section 27.7.5), which are becoming very
popular and use tools like Siri from Apple and Cortana from Microsoft.

This chapter provided an introductory treatment of a vast field. The interested
reader should refer to the end-of-chapter bibliography for specialized texts on
information retrieval and search engines.

Review Questions

27.1. What is structured data and what is unstructured data? Give an example of
each from your experience.

27.2. Give a general definition of information retrieval (IR). What does informa-
tion retrieval involve when we consider information on the Web?

27.3. Discuss the types of data and the types of users in today’s information
retrieval systems.
