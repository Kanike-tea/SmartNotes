2.5 Graph Colouring

Given a planar or non-planar graph G, if we assign colours to its vertices in such a way that no

two adjacent vertices have (receive) the same colour, then we say that the graph G is properly
coloured.

In other words, proper colouring of a graph means assigning colours to its vertices such
that adjacent vertices have different colours.
