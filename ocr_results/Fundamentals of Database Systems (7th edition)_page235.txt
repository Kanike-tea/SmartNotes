ON DELETE?

The SQL language, originally named SEQUEL, was based on the language SQUARE
(Specifying Queries as Relational Expressions) described by Boyce et al. (1975). The
syntax of SQUARE was modified into SEQUEL (Chamberlin & Boyce, 1974) and
then into SEQUEL 2 (Chamberlin et al., 1976), on which SQL is based. The original
implementation of SEQUEL was done at IBM Research, San Jose, California. We
will give additional references to various aspects of SQL at the end of Chapter 7.
