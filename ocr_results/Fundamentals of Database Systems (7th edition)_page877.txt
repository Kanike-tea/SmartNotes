23.2. Data Fragmentation, Replication, and Allocation Techniques for Distributed Database Design

23.2 Data Fragmentation, Replication,
and Allocation Techniques for Distributed
Database Design

In this section, we discuss techniques that are used to break up the database into
logical units, called fragments, which may be assigned for storage at the various
nodes. We also discuss the use of data replication, which permits certain data to be
stored in more than one site to increase availability and reliability; and the process
of allocating fragments—or replicas of fragments—for storage at the various nodes.
These techniques are used during the process of distributed database design. The
information concerning data fragmentation, allocation, and replication is stored in
a global directory that is accessed by the DDBS applications as needed.

23.2.1 Data Fragmentation and Sharding

In a DDB, decisions must be made regarding which site should be used to store
which portions of the database. For now, we will assume that there is no replication;
that is, each relation—or portion of a relation—is stored at one site only. We dis-
cuss replication and its effects later in this section. We also use the terminology of
relational databases, but similar concepts apply to other data models. We assume
that we are starting with a relational database schema and must decide on how to
distribute the relations over the various sites. To illustrate our discussion, we use
the relational database schema shown in Figure 5.5.

Before we decide on how to distribute the data, we must determine the logical units of
the database that are to be distributed. The simplest logical units are the relations
themselves; that is, each whole relation is to be stored at a particular site. In our exam-
ple, we must decide on a site to store each of the relations EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT,
PROJECT, WORKS_ON, and DEPENDENT in Figure 5.5. In many cases, however, a
relation can be divided into smaller logical units for distribution. For example,
consider the company database shown in Figure 5.6, and assume there are three
computer sites—one for each department in the company.’

We may want to store the database information relating to each department at the
computer site for that department. A technique called horizontal fragmentation or
sharding can be used to partition each relation by department.

Horizontal Fragmentation (Sharding). A horizontal fragment or shard of a
relation is a subset of the tuples in that relation. The tuples that belong to the horizontal
fragment can be specified by a condition on one or more attributes of the relation, or
by some other mechanism. Often, only a single attribute is involved in the condition.
For example, we may define three horizontal fragments on the EMPLOYEE relation in
Figure 5.6 with the following conditions: (Dno = 5), (Dno = 4), and (Dno = 1)—each

‘Of course, in an actual situation, there will be many more tuples in the relation than those shown in
Figure 5.6.
