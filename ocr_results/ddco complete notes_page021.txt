FIGURE 3.19
Solution to Example 3.9

> The procedure described in the previous example indicates that a Boolean
function can be implemented with two levels of NAND gates. The procedure for
obtaining the logic diagram from a Boolean function is as follows:

1. Simplify the function and express it in sum-of-products form.

2. Draw a NAND gate for each product term of the expression that has at least
two literals. The inputs to each NAND gate are the literals of the term. This procedure
produces a group of first-level gates.

3. Draw a single gate using the AND-invert or the invert-OR graphic symbol in
the second level, with inputs coming from outputs of first-level gates.

4. A term with a single literal requires an inverter in the first level. However, if the
single literal is complemented, it can be connected directly to an input of the second-
level NAND gate.

Multilevel NAND Circuits

> The standard form of expressing Boolean functions results in a two-level
implementation. There are occasions, however, when the design of digital systems
results in gating structures with three or more levels.

> The most common procedure in the design of multilevel circuits is to express the
Boolean function in terms of AND, OR, and complement operations. The function
can then be implemented with AND and OR gates. After that, if necessary, it can
be converted into an all-NAND circuit.
