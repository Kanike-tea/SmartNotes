EXECUTION OF A COMPLETE INSTRUCTION

«Consider the instruction Add (R3),R1 which adds the contents of a memory-location
pointed by R3 to register R1. Executing this instruction requires the following
actions:

1) Fetch the instruction.

2) Fetch the first operand.

3) Perform the addition &

4) Load the result into R1.

« Instruction execution proceeds as follows:
Step1--> The instruction-fetch operation is initiated by
— loading contents of PC into MAR &
— sending a Read request to memory.
The Select signal is set to Select4, which causes the Mux to select constant 4. This
value is added to operand at input B (PC‘s content), and the result is stored in Z.
Step2--> Updated value in Z is moved to PC. This completes the PC increment operation
and PC will now point to next instruction.
Step3--> Fetched instruction is moved into MDR and then to IR. The step 1 through 3
constitutes the Fetch Phase.
At the beginning of step 4, the instruction decoder interprets the contents of the IR.
This enables the control circuitry to activate the control-signals for steps 4 through
7.
The step 4 through 7 constitutes the Execution Phase.
Step4--> Contents of R3 are loaded into MAR & a memory read signal is issued.
Step5--> Contents of R1 are transferred to Y to prepare for addition.
Step6--> When Read operation is completed, memory-operand is available in MDR, and the
