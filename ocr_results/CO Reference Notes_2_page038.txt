(a) Interrupts should be enabled, except when C is being serviced. The nesting rules can be
enforced by manipulating the interrupt-enable flags in the interfaces of A and B.

(b) A and B should be connected to INTR , and C to INTR. When an interrupt-request is
received from either A or B, interrupts from the other device will be automatically disabled until
the request has been serviced. However, interrupt-requests from C will always be accepted.

Problem 4:

Consider a computer in which several devices are connected to a common interrupt-request line.

Explain how you would arrange for interrupts from device j to be accepted before the execution of the

interrupt service routine for device i is completed. Comment in particular on the times at which

interrupts must be enabled and disabled at various points in the system.

Solution:
Interrupts are disabled before the interrupt-service routine is entered. Once device i turns off its
interrupt-request, interrupts may be safely enabled in the processor. If the interface-circuit of
device i turns off its interrupt-request when it receives the interrupt acknowledge signal,
interrupts may be enabled at the beginning of the interrupt-service routine of device i.
Otherwise, interrupts may be enabled only after the instruction that causes device i to turn off its
interrupt-request has been executed.

Problem 5:
Consider the daisy chain arrangement. Assume that after a device generates an interrupt-request, it turns
off that request as soon as it receives the interrupt acknowledge signal. Is it still necessary to disable
interrupts in the processor before entering the interrupt service routine? Why?
Solution:
Yes, because other devices may keep the interrupt-request line asserted.
