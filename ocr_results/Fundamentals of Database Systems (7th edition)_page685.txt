Strategies for Query Processing’

n this chapter, we discuss the techniques used inter-

nally by a DBMS to process high-level queries. A
query expressed in a high-level query language such as SQL must first be scanned,
parsed, and validated.” The scanner identifies the query tokens—such as SQL key-
words, attribute names, and relation names—that appear in the text of the query,
whereas the parser checks the query syntax to determine whether it is formulated
according to the syntax rules (rules of grammar) of the query language. The query
must also be validated by checking that all attribute and relation names are valid
and semantically meaningful names in the schema of the particular database being
queried. An internal representation of the query is then created, usually as a tree
data structure called a query tree. It is also possible to represent the query using a
graph data structure called a query graph, which is generally a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). The DBMS must then devise an execution strategy or query plan
for retrieving the results of the query from the database files. A query has many pos-
sible execution strategies, and the process of choosing a suitable one for processing
a query is known as query optimization.

We defer a detailed discussion of query optimization to the next chapter. In this
chapter, we will primarily focus on how queries are processed and what algorithms
are used to perform individual operations within the query. Figure 18.1 shows the
different steps of processing a high-level query. The query optimizer module has
the task of producing a good execution plan, and the code generator generates the
code to execute that plan. The runtime database processor has the task of running
(executing) the query code, whether in compiled or interpreted mode, to produce
the query result. If a runtime error results, an error message is generated by the
runtime database processor.
