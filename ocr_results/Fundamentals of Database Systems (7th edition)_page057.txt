1.8 When Not to Use a DBMS

In spite of the advantages of using a DBMS, there are a few situations in which a
DBMS may involve unnecessary overhead costs that would not be incurred in
traditional file processing. The overhead costs of using a DBMS are due to the
following:

= High initial investment in hardware, software, and training
= The generality that a DBMS provides for defining and processing data

= Overhead for providing security, concurrency control, recovery, and integ-
rity functions

Therefore, it may be more desirable to develop customized database applications
under the following circumstances:

= Simple, well-defined database applications that are not expected to change
at all

= Stringent, real-time requirements for some application programs that may
not be met because of DBMS overhead

= Embedded systems with limited storage capacity, where a general-purpose
DBMS would not fit

= No multiple-user access to data

Certain industries and applications have elected not to use general-purpose
DBMSs. For example, many computer-aided design (CAD) tools used by mechan-
ical and civil engineers have proprietary file and data management software that
is geared for the internal manipulations of drawings and 3D objects. Similarly,
communication and switching systems designed by companies like AT&T were
early manifestations of database software that was made to run very fast with
hierarchically organized data for quick access and routing of calls. GIS imple-
mentations often implement their own data organization schemes for efficiently
implementing functions related to processing maps, physical contours, lines,
polygons, and so on.

1.9 Summary

In this chapter we defined a database as a collection of related data, where data
means recorded facts. A typical database represents some aspect of the real world
and is used for specific purposes by one or more groups of users. A DBMS is a
generalized software package for implementing and maintaining a computerized
database. The database and software together form a database system. We identi-
fied several characteristics that distinguish the database approach from traditional
file-processing applications, and we discussed the main categories of database
users, or the actors on the scene. We noted that in addition to database users, there
are several categories of support personnel, or workers behind the scene, in a data-
base environment.
