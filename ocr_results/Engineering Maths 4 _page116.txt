34, Starting from a suitable recurrence relation show that
AN = Jy ~2y * Ina
OBI" = Ing ~ Inna * Bint Ines
>> We have the recurrence relation
20, = Juma — Ines mnntl)
Differentiating w.r.t x we have,
In = Ina1 yay
Multiplying by 2 we obtain,
4M = Dy ~ niet
. We use (1) in the RHS of this equation replacing n by (1-1) and also by (n+1).
te, AYP = (gd, Up Jae)
: Thus 4] = Jy — 2S, +JIy42 astequired.
, 2 Differentiating this relation w.r-t. x again we have,
Multiplying by 2 we obtain.
© BU" = 2h 3 = 2020) + 2a)

Now using (1) inthe RHSby replacing n by (n-2) and n by (n+2) forthe first
_ and third terms along with (1) for the second term we obtain,

By,” e Oy-3 ~Ina1) - 2Uq-1 > Inga) + nad ~SIna3)

“+ 35, Prove that 4 J,” (x) +3] (x) + Jg(x) = 0

>> - We have established in the previous problem the result,
. BI” = Ing = Ina * 8Inaa — Ings
Putting n = 0 in this equation we have,
8)o’ =1_3-31.,+3),-h
, Using J_, =(-1)"J,, this equation becomes
