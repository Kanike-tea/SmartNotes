11.2 Overview of Basic Features of PHP

A numeric array associates a numeric index (or position or sequence number) with
each element in the array. Indexes are integer numbers that start at zero and grow
incrementally. An element in the array is referenced through its index. An
associative array provides pairs of (key => value) elements. The value of an element
is referenced through its key, and all key values in a particular array must be unique.
The element values can be strings or integers, or they can be arrays themselves, thus
leading to higher dimensional arrays.

Figure 11.3 gives two examples of array variables: $teaching and $courses. The
first array $teaching is associative (see line 0 in Figure 11.3), and each element
associates a course name (as key) with the name of the course instructor (as value).
There are three elements in this array. Line 1 shows how the array may be updated.
The first command in line 1 assigns a new instructor to the course ‘Graphics’ by
updating its value. Since the key value ‘Graphics’ already exists in the array, no new
element is created but the existing value is updated. The second command creates a
new element since the key value ‘Data Mining’ did not exist in the array before.
New elements are added at the end of the array.

If we only provide values (no keys) as array elements, the keys are automatically
numeric and numbered 0, 1, 2, ... . This is illustrated in line 5 of Figure 11.3, by
the $courses array. Both associative and numeric arrays have no size limits. If
some value of another data type, say an integer, is assigned to a PHP variable that
was holding an array, the variable now holds the integer value and the array con-
tents are lost. Basically, most variables can be assigned to values of any data type
at any time.

There are several different techniques for looping through arrays in PHP. We illus-
trate two of these techniques in Figure 11.3. Lines 3 and 4 show one method of
looping through all the elements in an array using the foreach construct, and
printing the key and value of each element on a separate line. Lines 7 through 10
show how a traditional for-loop construct can be used. A built-in function count

0) $teaching = array('Database' => 'Smith', 'OS' => ‘Carrick’,
‘Graphics’ => 'Kam');

1) $teaching['Graphics'] = 'Benson'; $teaching['Data Mining'] = 'Li';

2) sort($teaching);

3) foreach ($teaching as $key => $value) {

4) print " $key : $value\n";}

5) $courses = array('Database', 'O0S', 'Graphics', ‘Data Mining');
6) $alt_row_color = array('blue', 'yellow');

7) for ($i = 0, $num = count($courses); i < $num; $i++) {

8) print '<?R bgcolor="' . $alt_row_color[$i % 2] . '">";

9) print "<TD>Course $i is</TD><TD>$course[$i]</TD></TR>\n";
10) }
