12. Evaluate the effectiveness of lipids as cleaning agents or detergents.

Ans. The working principle of lipids as cleaning agents or detergents is based on their ability to
dissolve grease and oils. Lipids are composed of hydrophobic (water-fearing) and hydrophilic
(Water-loving) regions, which allows them to surround grease and oils, effectively breaking them
down into smaller particles that can be more easily removed. This is why lipids are commonly

used in cleaning products such as soaps, shampoos, laundry detergents, and dishwashing liquids.

When a lipid-based cleaning agent is applied to a surface, the hydrophobic regions of the lipid
molecule surround and dissolve grease and oils, while the hydrophilic regions interact with water,
allowing the mixture to be rinsed away. The combination of the lipid and water also forms an

emulsion, which helps to suspend and remove dirt and debris.

In addition, some lipids have additional properties, such as foaming or lathering capabilities,
that can enhance their cleaning performance. For example, fatty alcohols can be used as
foaming agents in shampoos, while soap is known for its lathering properties. These additional
properties can help to loosen and remove dirt and debris, making the cleaning process more

effective.
13. What are the different functions performed by proteins in our body?
Ans. Functions of Proteins

Proteins perform a wide range of functions in the body, including

1) Catalyzing chemical reactions

Amylase: An enzyme that breaks down starch into simple sugars like glucose and maltose. It is
found in saliva and pancreatic juice.

Lipase: An enzyme that breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. It is found in the pancreas
and small intestine.

Catalase: An enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It is found in most
cells of the body.

Trypsin: An enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. It is produced in the

pancreas and released into the small intestine.
