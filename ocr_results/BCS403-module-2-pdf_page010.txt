Database Management System [BCS403]

To define referential integrity more formally, first we define the concept of a foreign key. The
conditions for a foreign key, given below, specify a referential integrity constraint between the two
relation schemas R; and R2.
A set of attributes FK in relation schema R: is a foreign key of Ri that references relation R2 if it
satisfies the following rules:
1. Attributes in FK have the same domain(s) as the primary key attributes PK of R2; the
attributes FK are said to reference or refer to the relation R2.
2. A value of FK in a tuple ¢; of the current state 71(R1) either occurs as a value of PK for

some tuple f2 in the current state r2(R2) or is NULL.
In the former case, we have ti[FK] = [PK], and we say that the tuple t; references or refers to the
tuple f2.
In this definition, Ri is called the referencing relation and R2 is the referenced relation. If these

two conditions hold, a referential integrity constraint from Rj to R2 is said to hold.

1.2.5 Other Types of Constraints

Semantic integrity constraints

Semantic integrity constraints can be specified.and enforced within the application programs that
update the database, or by using a general-purpose constraint specification language. Examples of
such constraints are the salary of an employee should not exceed the salary of the employee’s
supervisor and the maximum number of hours an employee can work on all projects per week is 56.
Mechanisms called triggers and assertions can be used. In SQL, CREATE ASSERTION and
CREATE TRIGGER statements can be used for this purpose.

Functional dependency constraint
Functional dependency constraint establishes a functional relationship among two sets of attributes X
and Y. This constraint specifies that the value of X determines a unique value of Y in all states of a
relation; it is denoted as a functional dependency X — Y. We use functional dependencies and other
types of dependencies as tools to analyze the quality of relational designs and to “normalize”
relations to improve their quality.
State constraints(static constraints)

Define the constraints that a valid state of the database must satisfy
Transition constraints(dynamic constraints)

Define to deal with state changes in the database
