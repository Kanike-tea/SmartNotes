referenced code or data into faster memory when first accessed, each subsequent access will be

much faster. It is the repeated access to the faster memory that improves performance.

The cache makes use of this repeated local reference in both time and space. If the reference is in

time, it is called temporal locality. If it is by address proximity, then it is called spatial locality.
2. Cache Architecture

ARM uses two bus architectures in its cached cores, the Von Neumann and the Harvard. The
Von Neumann and Harvard bus architectures differ in the separation of the instruction and data
paths between the core and memory. A different cache design is used to support the two

architectures.

In processor cores using the Von Neumann architecture, there is a single cache used for
instruction and data. This type of cache is known as a unified cache. A unified cache memory

contains both instruction and data values.

The Harvard architecture has separate instruction and data buses to improve overall system
performance, but supporting the two buses requires two caches. In processor cores using the
Harvard architecture, there are two caches: an instruction cache (I-cache) and a data cache (D-
cache). This type of cache is known as a split cache. In a split cache, instructions are stored in

the instruction cache and data values are stored in the data cache.
2.1. Basic Architecture of a Cache Memory
A simple cache memory is shown on the right side of Figure 4. It has three main parts:

e A directory store
e A data section

e Status information.

All three parts of the cache memory are present for each cache line. The cache must know where
the information stored in a cache line originates from in main memory. It uses a directory store to
hold the address identifying where the cache line was copied from main memory. The directory

entry is known as a cache-tag.
