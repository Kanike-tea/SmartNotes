roughly corresponds to the run time and the required resources. The goal of cost-
based optimization in Oracle is to find the best trade-off between the lowest run
time and the least resource utilization.

19.9.2 Global Query Optimizer

In traditional RDBMSs, query optimization consists of two distinct logical and
physical optimization phases. In contrast, Oracle has a global query optimizer,
where logical transformation and physical optimization phases have been inte-
grated to generate an optimal execution plan for the entire query tree. The architec-
ture of the Oracle query processing is illustrated in Figure 19.7.

Oracle performs a multitude of query transformations, which change and trans-
form the user queries into equivalent but potentially more optimal forms. Transfor-
mations can be either heuristic-based or cost-based. The cost-based query
transformation (CBQT) framework” introduced in Oracle 10g provides efficient
mechanisms for exploring the state space generated by applying one or more trans-
formations. During cost-based transformation, an SQL statement, which may com-
prise multiple query blocks, is copied and transformed and its cost is computed
using the physical optimizer. This process is repeated multiple times, each time
applying a new set of possibly interdependent transformations; and, at the end, one
or more transformations are selected and applied to the original SQL statement, if
those transformations result in an optimal execution plan. To deal with the combi-
natorial explosion, the CBQT framework provides efficient strategies for searching
the state space of various transformations.

The availability of the general framework for cost-based transformation has made it
possible for other innovative transformations to be added to the vast repertoire of
