is the required series solution of the given d.e.

Remark: Comparison with the analytical solution.

We have, (D7 +1)y = 0, where D= <

Auxilary equation is m+1=0 andm = +iare its roots.
The analytical solution is given by
Y = ¢, cOsx+c, sinx
The series solution obtained by us can be represented as _
y= 4,cosx+a,sinx [Refer standard series (5) and (6)]

This is same as the series solution.
