Module-5: Concurrency Control in Databases

5.8 Introduction to Concurrency Control

+ Purpose of Concurrency Control

- To enforce Isolation (through mutual exclusion) among conflicting transactions.
-— To preserve database consistency through consistency preserving execution of
transactions.

— To resolve read-write and write-write conflicts.

+ Example:
— In concurrent execution environment if T1 conflicts with T2 over a data item A, then
the existing concurrency control decides if T1 or T2 should get the A and if the other

transaction is rolled-back or waits.
5.9 Two-Phase Locking Techniques for Concurrency Control

= The concept of locking data items is one of the main techniques used for controlling the
concurrent execution of transactions.

= A lock is a variable associated with a data item in the database. Generally there is a lock
for each data item in the database.

= A lock describes the status of the data item with respect to possible operations that can be
applied to that item.

= Itis used for synchronizing the access by concurrent transactions to the database items.

= A transaction locks an object before using it

= When an object is locked by another transaction, the requesting transaction must wait

5.9.1 Types of Locks and System Lock Tables

1. Binary Locks

= A binary lock can have two states or values: locked and unlocked (or 1
and 0).

= If the value of the lock on X is 1, item X cannot be accessed by a database
operation that requests the item
