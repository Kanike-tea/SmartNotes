asymmetric. The reason for the terms symmetric and asymmetric will be
apparent in the context of binary relations in Section 9-3.

Complete Digraphs: A complete undirected graph was defined as a simple
graph in which every vertex is joined to every other vertex exactly by one edge.
For digraphs we have two types of complete graphs. A complete symmetric
digraph is a simple digraph in which there is exactly one edge directed from
every vertex to every other vertex (Fig. 9-3), and a complete asymmetric digraph
is an asymmetric digraph in which there is exactly one edge between every pair
of vertices (Fig. 9-2).

A complete asymmetric digraph of n vertices contains n(n — l)/2 edges, but a
complete symmetric digraph of n vertices contains n(n — 1) edges. A complete
asymmetric digraph is also called a tournament or a complete tournament (the
reason for this term will be made clear in Section 9-10).

A digraph is said to be balanced if for every vertex v; the in-degree equals the

out-degree; that is, d *(v,) = d “(v;). (A balanced digraph is also referred to as a

pseudosymmetric digraph, or an isograph.) A balanced digraph is said to be
regular if every vertex has the same in-degree and out-degree as every other
vertex.

9-3. DIGRAPHS AND BINARY RELATIONS

The theory of graphs and the calculus of binary relations are closely related
(so much so that some people often mistakenly come to regard graph theory as a
branch of the theory of relations).
