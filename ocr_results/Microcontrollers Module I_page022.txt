The above example shown in following figure, the C flag is the only condition flag set. The
rest nzvq flags are all clear. The processor is inARMstate because neither the Jazelle j or

Thumb t bits are set. The IRQ interrupts are enabled, and FIQ interrupts are disabled.

Conditional Execution:

Conditional execution controls whether or not the core will execute an instruction. Most
instructions have a condition attribute that determines if the core will execute it based on the
setting of the condition flags. Prior to execution, the processor compares the condition
attribute with the condition flags in the cpsr. If they match, then the instruction is executed;
otherwise the instruction is ignored.

Condition mnemonics.

Mnemonic Name Condition flags
EQ equal Z

NE not equal z

cS HS carry set/unsigned higher or same Cc

cc LO carry clear/unsigned lower c

MI minus/negative N

PL plus/positive or zero n

VS overflow Vv

vc no overflow v

HI unsigned higher

LS unsigned lower or same Zore

GE signed greater than or equal NVor nv
LT signed less than vor nV

GT signed greater than izV or nzv
LE signed less than or equal Zor Nvor nV
AL always (unconditional) ignored

The condition attribute is post fixed to the instruction mnemonic, which is encoded into the
instruction. The above table lists the conditional execution code mnemonics. When a

condition mnemonic is not present, the default behavior is to set it to always (AL) execute.

4. Pipeline

A pipeline is the mechanism a RISC processor uses to execute instructions. Using a pipeline
speeds up execution by fetching the next instruction while other instructions are being

decoded and executed. Figure 4 shows a three-stage pipeline:
