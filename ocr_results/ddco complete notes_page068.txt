Introduction
1 Computer Organization explains the function and design of the various units of-digital
computers that store and process information.
{| It also deals with the input units of the computerwhich receive information from external
sources and the output units which send computed results to external destinations.
[| The input, storage, processing, and output operations are governed by a list of instructions
that constitute a program.
[) It deals about computer hardware and computer architecture?
1 Computer hardware consists of electronic circuits, magnetie and optical storage devices,
displays, electromechanical devices, and communication facilities.
Computer architecture encompasses the.specification of an instruction set and the functional
behavior of the hardware units that implement,the instructions

Classes of Computers

e Desktop/laptop computers

e General purpose, variety of software

e Subject to cost/performance tradeoff
e Workstations

e More computing power used in engg. applications, graphics etc.
e Enterprise System/ Mainframes

e Used for business data processing
e Server computers (Low End Range)

e Network based

e High capacity, performance, reliability

e Range from small servers to building sized
e Supercomputer (High End Range)

° Large scale numerical calculation such as weather forecasting, aircraft
lesign

e Embedded computers
e Hidden as components of systems
e Stringent power/performance/cost constraints
