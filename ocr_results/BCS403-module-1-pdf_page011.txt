Database Management System [BCS403]

Space. However, it is sometimes necessary to use controlled redundancy to improve the
performance of queries. For example, we may store Student_name and Course_number
redundantly in a GRADE_REPORT file because whenever we retrieve a GRADE_REPORT
record, we want to retrieve the student name and course number along with the grade, student
number, and section identifier.
A DBMS should provide the capability to automatically enforce the rule that no inconsistencies
are introduced when data is updated.

2. Restricting Unauthorized Access
When multiple users share a large database, it is likely that most users will not be authorized to
access all information in the database. For example, financial data is often considered
confidential and only authorized persons are allowed to access such data. In addition, some
users may only be permitted to retrieve data, whereas others are allowed to retrieve and update.
Hence, the type of access operation—tretrieval or update—must also be controlled. A DBMS
should provide a security and authorization subsystem, which the DBA uses to create
accounts, to specify account restrictions and enforce these restrictions automatically.

3. Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects
The values of program variables or objects are discarded once a program terminates, unless
the programmer explicitly stores them in permanent files, which often involves converting
these complex structures into a format suitable for file storage. Object-oriented database
systems make it easier for complex runtime objects to be saved in secondary storage so as to
survive beyond program termination and to be retrievable at a later time.
Object-oriented database systems are compatible with programming languages suchas = C++

and Java, and the DBMS software automatically performs any necessary conversions.

4. Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing

DBMS maintains indexes that are utilized to improve the execution time of queries and
updates. DBMS has a buffering or caching module that maintains parts of the database in main
memory buffers. The query processing and optimization module is responsible for choosing an
efficient query execution plan for each query submitted to the system.

5. Providing Backup and Recovery
The backup and recovery subsystem of the DBMS is responsible for recovery. For example, if

the computer system fails in the middle of a complex update transaction, the recovery
