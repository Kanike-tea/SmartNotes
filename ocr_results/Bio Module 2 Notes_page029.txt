in laundry detergents, which not only raise the level of cleaning, but also provide environmental
benefits. Lipases and amylases are joined proteases in improving detergent efficacy, especially
for household laundering at lower temperatures and, in industrial cleaning operations, at lower
PH levels. Cellulases contribute to overall fabric care by rejuvenating or maintaining the new

appearance of washed garments.

Detergent mechanism based on enzymes

From an enzyme point of view, detergents on the international market contain principal
ingredients that operate by almost identical detergency mechanisms. Soil and stains are
removed by mechanical action assisted by surfactants, builders, and enzymes. Alkaline
proteases, amylases, or lipases in heavyduty detergents hydrolyze and solubilize substrate soil
attached to fabrics or hard surfaces. Cellulases clean by hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds which
removes particulate soils attached to cotton microfibers. Key effects of cellulases are to soften
and improve the color brightness of worn textile surfaces. Surfactants lower the surface tension
at interfaces and enhance the repulsive force between the original soil, enzymatically degraded
soil, and the fabric. Builders act to chelate, precipitate or ion-exchange calcium and magnesium
salts, to provide alkalinity, to prevent soil redeposition, to provide buffering capacity, and to

inhibit corrosion.

Proteases

Proteases are the most widely used enzymes. In laundry detergents, protein stains such as grass,
blood, egg, and human sweat are removed through proteolysis. In ADD, proteases secure the
removal of proteinaceous food films, which are a particular problem with glassware and
cutlery. Serine proteases are the most important group for detergent applications. Proteases
catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of the peptide chain. The most important parameters for the
hydrolysis reaction are surface-available substrate S, E/S, pH, reaction time, and temperature.
Together with the specificity and properties of the enzyme itself, these parameters are

responsible for the course of reaction on a given protein stain.

Amylases

Native starch is only slowly degraded by a-amylases. Gelatinization and swelling are needed

to make the starch susceptible to enzymatic breakdown. For most foods, various degrees of

gelatinization result from cooking. Therefore, in detergents for laundry and automatic
