15.6 Other Dependencies and Normal Forms

Furthermore, there are no sets of sound and complete inference rules to reason
about them. In the remaining part of this section, we introduce some other types of
dependencies that have been identified. Among them, the inclusion dependencies
and those based on arithmetic or similar functions are used frequently.

15.6.2 Inclusion Dependencies

Inclusion dependencies were defined in order to formalize two types of interrela-
tional constraints:

= The foreign key (or referential integrity) constraint cannot be specified as a
functional or multivalued dependency because it relates attributes across
relations.

= The constraint between two relations that represent a class/subclass rela-
tionship (see Chapters 4 and 9) also has no formal definition in terms of the
functional, multivalued, and join dependencies.

Definition. An inclusion dependency R.X < S.Y between two sets of attri-
butes—X of relation schema R, and Y of relation schema S—specifies the con-
straint that, at any specific time when r is a relation state of R and s is a relation
state of S, we must have

Tx(r(R)) & Ty(s(S))

The Cc (subset) relationship does not necessarily have to be a proper subset. Obviously,
the sets of attributes on which the inclusion dependency is specified—X of R and Y of
S—must have the same number of attributes. In addition, the domains for each pair of
corresponding attributes should be compatible. For example, if X = {Aj, Ao, ... , An}
and Y = {B;, B, ... , B,}, one possible correspondence is to have dom(A;) compatible
with dom(B)) for 1 < i <n. In this case, we say that A; corresponds to Bj.

For example, we can specify the following inclusion dependencies on the relational
schema in Figure 14.1:

DEPARTMENT.Dmgr_ssn < EMPLOYEE.Ssn

WORKS_ON.Ssn < EMPLOYEE.Ssn

EMPLOYEE.Dnumber < DEPARTMENT.Dnumber

PROJECT.Dnum < DEPARTMENT.Dnumber

WORKS_ON.Pnumber < PROJECT.Pnumber

DEPT_LOCATIONS.Dnumber < DEPARTMENT.Dnumber
All the preceding inclusion dependencies represent referential integrity
constraints. We can also use inclusion dependencies to represent class/subclass
relationships. For example, in the relational schema of Figure 9.6, we can specify
the following inclusion dependencies:

EMPLOYEE.Ssn < PERSON.Ssn

ALUMNUS.Ssn < PERSON.Ssn

STUDENT.Ssn < PERSON.Ssn.
