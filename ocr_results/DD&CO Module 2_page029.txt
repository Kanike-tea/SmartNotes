the inputs of the latches through the combinational circuit. If the inputs applied to the latches change
while the clock pulse is still at the logic-1 level, the latches will respond to new values and a new output
state may occur. The result is an unpredictable situation, since the state of the latches may keep changing
for as long as the clock pulse stays at the active level. Because of this unreliable operation, the output of
a latch cannot be applied directly or through combinational logic to the input of the same or another latch
when all the latches are triggered by a common clock source.

Flip-flop circuits are constructed in such a way as to make them operate properly when they are part of
a sequential circuit that employs a common clock. As shown in below Fig(a), a positive level response
in the enable input allows changes in the output when the D input changes while the clock pulse stays at
logic 1. The key to the proper operation of a flip-flop is to trigger it only during a signal transition. This
can be accomplished by eliminating the feedback path that is inherent in the operation of the sequential
circuit using latches. A clock pulse goes through two transitions: from 0 to 1 and the return from | to 0.
As shown in below Fig, the positive transition is defined as the positive edge and the negative transition
as the negative edge. There are two ways that a latch can be modified to form a flip-flop. One way is to
employ two latches in a special configuration that isolates the output of the flip-flop and prevents it from
being affected while the input to the flip-flop is changing. Another way is to produce a flip-flop that
triggers only during a signal transition (from 0 to | or from 1 to 0) of the synchronizing signal (clock)
and is disabled during the rest of the clock pulse.

Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop

The construction of a D flip-flop with two D latches and an inverter is shown in Fig below. The first
latch is called the master and the second the slave. The circuit samples the D input and changes its output
Q only at the negative edge of the synchronizing or controlling clock (designated as Clk). When the
clock is 0, the output of the inverter is 1. The slave latch is enabled, and its output Q is equal to the
master output Y . The master latch is disabled because Clk = 0. When the input pulse changes to the
logic-1 level, the data from the external D input are transferred to the master. The slave, however, is
disabled as long as the clock remains at the | level, because its enable input is equal to 0. Any change in
the input changes the master output at Y, but cannot affect the slave output. When the clock pulse returns
to 0, the master is disabled and is isolated from the D input. At the same time, the slave is enabled and
the value of Y is transferred to the output of the flip-flop at Q . Thus, a change in the output of the flip-
flop can be triggered only by and during the transition of the clock from | to 0.
