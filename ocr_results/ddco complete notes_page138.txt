2) control hazards or instruction hazards: The pipeline may also be stalled
because of a delay in the availability of an instruction.

For example, this may be a result of a miss in the cache .

3) A third type of hazard known as a structural hazard: This is the
situation when two instructions require the use of a given hardware
resource at the same time.

The effect of a cache miss on pipelined operation is illustrated in Figure.
Instruction I1 is fetched from the cache in cycle 1, and its execution proceeds
normally. However, the fetch operation for instruction I2, which is started in
cycle 2, results in a cache miss. The instruction fetch unit must now suspend
any further fetch requests and wait for I2 to arrive. We assume that
instruction I2 is received and loaded into buffer B1 at the end of cycle 5. The
pipeline resumes its normal operation at that point.

Figure 8.4 Pipeline stall caused by a cache miss in F2 Eg: for Instruction Hazard

An alternative representation of the operation of a pipeline in the case of a
cache miss is shown in Figure b. This figure gives the function performed by
each pipeline stage in each clock cycle. Note that the Decode unit is idle in
cycles 3 through 5, the Execute unit is idle in cycles 4 through 6, and the
Write unit is idle in cycles 5 through 7. Such idle periods are called stalls.
They are also often referred to as bubbles in the pipeline.
