1.7. Connected and Disconnected Graphy 43

p Let x be the number of vertices in one of the components of G, Then the other component
has n ~ x vertices. Since both components are complete graphs, the number of edges they have
are Lx(x~ 1) and 5(n ~ x)(n = x= 1) tespectively *, Therefore, the total number of edges in G

Therefore, m is minimum when 2x — n = 0, or x = n/2. And
