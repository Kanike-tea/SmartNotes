Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems

24.1 Introduction to NOSQL Systems

24.1.1 Emergence of NOSQL Systems

Many companies and organizations are faced with applications that store vast
amounts of data. Consider a free e-mail application, such as Google Mail or Yahoo
Mail or other similar service—this application can have millions of users, and each
user can have thousands of e-mail messages. There is a need for a storage system
that can manage all these e-mails; a structured relational SQL system may not be
appropriate because (1) SQL systems offer too many services (powerful query lan-
guage, concurrency control, etc.), which this application may not need; and (2) a
structured data model such the traditional relational model may be too restrictive.
Although newer relational systems do have more complex object-relational model-
ing options (see Chapter 12), they still require schemas, which are not required by
many of the NOSQL systems.

As another example, consider an application such as Facebook, with millions of
users who submit posts, many with images and videos; then these posts must be
displayed on pages of other users using the social media relationships among the
users. User profiles, user relationships, and posts must all be stored in a huge collec-
tion of data stores, and the appropriate posts must be made available to the sets of
users that have signed up to see these posts. Some of the data for this type of appli-
cation is not suitable for a traditional relational system and typically needs multiple
types of databases and data storage systems.

Some of the organizations that were faced with these data management and storage
applications decided to develop their own systems:

= Google developed a proprietary NOSQL system known as BigTable, which is
used in many of Google’s applications that require vast amounts of data stor-
age, such as Gmail, Google Maps, and Web site indexing. Apache Hbase is an
open source NOSQL system based on similar concepts. Google’s innovation
led to the category of NOSQL systems known as column-based or wide
column stores; they are also sometimes referred to as column family stores.

= Amazon developed a NOSQL system called DynamoDB that is available
through Amazon’s cloud services. This innovation led to the category known
as key-value data stores or sometimes key-tuple or key-object data stores.

= Facebook developed a NOSQL system called Cassandra, which is now open
source and known as Apache Cassandra. This NOSQL system uses concepts
from both key-value stores and column-based systems.

= Other software companies started developing their own solutions and making
them available to users who need these capabilities—for example, MongoDB
and CouchDB, which are classified as document-based NOSQL systems or
document stores.

= Another category of NOSQL systems is the graph-based NOSQL systems,
or graph databases; these include Neo4J and GraphBase, among others.
