do so in a controlled manner so that the result of the updates is correct. For exam-
ple, when several reservation agents try to assign a seat on an airline flight, the
DBMS should ensure that each seat can be accessed by only one agent at a time for
assignment to a passenger. These types of applications are generally called online
transaction processing (OLTP) applications. A fundamental role of multiuser
DBMS software is to ensure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and
efficiently.

The concept of a transaction has become central to many database applications. A
transaction is an executing program or process that includes one or more database
accesses, such as reading or updating of database records. Each transaction is sup-
posed to execute a logically correct database access if executed in its entirety with-
out interference from other transactions. The DBMS must enforce several
transaction properties. The isolation property ensures that each transaction
appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though hundreds of
transactions may be executing concurrently. The atomicity property ensures that
either all the database operations in a transaction are executed or none are. We dis-
cuss transactions in detail in Part 9.

The preceding characteristics are important in distinguishing a DBMS from tradi-
tional file-processing software. In Section 1.6 we discuss additional features that
characterize a DBMS. First, however, we categorize the different types of people
who work in a database system environment.
