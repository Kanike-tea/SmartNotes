Overall, the ECG is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring heart-related issues and helps to provide

important information about the heart's function and health.

10. What are pacemakers? Explain the basic design and construction of pacemakers.
Ans. A pacemaker is a small device that is surgically implanted in the chest to regulate the heartbeat. It is
used to treat heart rhythm disorders, such as bradycardia (a slow heartbeat) or arrhythmias (abnormal heart

rhythms), by delivering electrical impulses to the heart to regulate its rhythm.

The basic design of a pacemaker consists of:

Generator: The generator is the main component of the pacemaker and contains a battery and electronic
circuitry to generate and control the electrical impulses.

Leads: Leads are thin wires that connect the generator to the heart and carry the electrical impulses from
the generator to the heart.

Electrodes: The electrodes are located at the end of the leads and are used to deliver the electrical impulses
to the heart.

Pacemakers can be designed to work in different ways, including:
