b) Enzymes in Bio bleaching

Ans. Bio-bleaching is the process of using microbial enzymes instead of harsh chemicals to remove
color and impurities from materials like paper pulp, textiles, and laundry. This eco-friendly
method reduces the use of chlorine and other toxic substances, making it a sustainable alternative in

industries.

How Bio-Bleaching Works

Microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) produce enzymes that break down natural pigments, lignin, and

stains. The most commonly used enzymes are:

e Laccases — Break down lignin in wood pulp and remove stains from textiles

e Xylanases — Help in bleaching paper pulp by breaking hemicellulose.

e Manganese Peroxidases & Lignin Peroxidases — Degrade lignin, making bleaching more

effective.

e Proteases & Lipases — Used in detergent formulations to remove protein- and fat-based stains in

laundry.

c) Enzymes in detergent formulation

Ans. Enzymes find use as functional ingredients in detergents and contribute to cleaning of laundry

and dishes in an efficient, environmentally mild, and energy-saving manner. Proteases, lipases,

amylases are the major class of detergent enzymes, each provides specific benefits for application

in laundry and automatic dishwashing. Proteases are the first to be used extensively in laundry

detergents, which not only raise the level of cleaning, but also provide environmental benefits.

Lipases and amylases are joined proteases in improving detergent efficacy, especially for

household laundering at lower temperatures and, in industrial cleaning operations, at lower pH

levels. Cellulases contribute to overall fabric care by rejuvenating or maintaining the new

appearance of washed garments.
