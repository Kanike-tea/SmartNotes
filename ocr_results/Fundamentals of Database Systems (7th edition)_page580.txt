from 512 to 8192 bytes. A disk with hard-coded sectors often has the sectors subdi-
vided or combined into blocks during initialization. Blocks are separated by fixed-
size interblock gaps, which include specially coded control information written
during disk initialization. This information is used to determine which block on the
track follows each interblock gap. Table 16.2 illustrates the specifications of typical
disks used on large servers in industry. The 10K prefix on disk names refers to the
rotational speeds in rpm (revolutions per minute.

There is continuous improvement in the storage capacity and transfer rates associ-
ated with disks; they are also progressively getting cheaper—currently costing only
a fraction of a dollar per megabyte of disk storage. Costs are going down so rapidly
that costs as low as $100/TB are already on the market.

A disk is a random access addressable device. Transfer of data between main mem-
ory and disk takes place in units of disk blocks. The hardware address of a block—
a combination of a cylinder number, track number (surface number within the
cylinder on which the track is located), and block number (within the track)—is
supplied to the disk I/O (input/output) hardware. In many modern disk drives, a
single number called LBA (logical block address), which is a number between 0 and
n (assuming the total capacity of the disk is n + 1 blocks), is mapped automatically
to the right block by the disk drive controller. The address of a buffer—a contiguous
