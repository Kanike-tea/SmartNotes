. Specify the following queries in relational algebra on the database schema

given in Exercise 5.16:

a.

List the number of courses taken by all students named John Smith in
Winter 2009 (i.e., Quarter=W09).

. Produce a list of textbooks (include Course#, Book_isbn, Book_title) for

courses offered by the ‘CS’ department that have used more than two books.

. List any department that has all its adopted books published by ‘Pearson

Publishing’.

. Specify the following queries in relational algebra on the database schema in

Exercise 5.17:

a.

For the salesperson named ‘Jane Doe’, list the following information for
all the cars she sold: Serial#, Manufacturer, Sale_price.

. List the Serial# and Model of cars that have no options.
. Consider the NATURAL JOIN operation between SALESPERSON and

change the order of relations)? Explain with an example.

. Write a query in relational algebra involving selection and one set opera-

tion and say in words what the query does.

Specify queries a, b, c, e, f, i, and j of Exercise 8.16 in both tuple and domain
relational calculus.

Specify queries a, b, c, and d of Exercise 8.17 in both tuple and domain rela-
tional calculus.
