of the application. These consist of the userdefined operations (or transactions) that will be

applied to the database, including both retrievals and updates.

Once the requirements have been collected and analyzed, the next step is to create a conceptual
schema for the database, using a high-level conceptual data model. This step is called conceptual
design. The conceptual schema is a concise description of the data requirements of the users and
includes detailed descriptions of the entity types, relationships, and constraints; these are expressed

using the concepts provided by the high-level data model.

The next step in database design is the actual implementation of the database, using a commercial
DBMS. Most current commercial DBMSs use an implementation data model—such as the
relational or the object-relational database model—so the conceptual schema is transformed from
the high-level data model into the implementation data model. This step is called logical design or
data model mapping; its result is a database schema inthe implementation data model of the

DBMS.

The last step is the physical design phase, during which the internal storage structures, file
organizations, indexes, access paths, and physical design parameters for the database files are
specified. In parallel with these activities, application programs are designed and implemented as

database transactions corresponding to the highlevel transaction specifications.

3.2 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys

The ER model describes data as entities, relationships, and attributes.

3.2.1 Entities and Attributes

Entity: a thing in the real world with an independent existence. An entity may be an object
with a physical existence (for example, a particular person, car, house, or employee) or it may
be an object with a conceptual existence (for instance, a company, a job, or a university

course).
