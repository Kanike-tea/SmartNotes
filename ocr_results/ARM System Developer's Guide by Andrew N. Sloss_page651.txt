638 Appendix B ARM and Thumb Instruction Encodings

For example if there are two op bits value 1 and 0, then the binary value 10 indicates
instruction number 2 in the list (the third instruction).

= The instruction operands have the same name as in the instruction description of
Appendix A.

The table uses the following abbreviations:

= Lis 1 if the L suffix applies for LDC and STC operations.

= Mis 1 if CPS changes processor mode. mode is defined in Table B.3.

= opland op2 are the opcode extension fields in coprocessor instructions.

= post indicates a postindexed addressing mode such as [Rn], Rm or [Rn], #immed.
= pre indicates a preindexed addressing mode such as [Rn, Rm] or [Rn, #immed].
= register_list is a bit field with bit k set if register Rk appears in the register list.

= rotis a byte rotate. The second operand is Rm ROR (8*rot).

= rotate is a bit rotate. The second operand is #immed ROR (2*rotate).

«= shiftand sh encode a shift type and direction. See Table B.4.

= Uis the up/down select for addressing modes. If U = 1, then we add the offset to the
base address, as in [Rn] , #4 or [Rn, Rm]. If U = 0, then we subtract the offset from the
base address, as in [Rn,#-4] or [Rn] ,-Rm.

= unindexed indicates an addressing mode of the form [Rn] , {option}.
= Ris 1 if the R (round) instruction suffix is present.

= Tis 1 if the T suffix is present on load and store instructions.

= Wis 1 if ! (writeback) is specified in the instruction mnemonic.

= Xis1 if the X (exchange) instruction suffix is present.

= xand yare 0 for the B suffix, 1 for the T suffix.

= “is 1 if the “ suffix is applied in LDM or STM instructions.

B.2 THUMB INSTRUCTION SET ENCODINGS

Table B.5 summarizes the bit encodings for the 16-bit Thumb instruction set. This table is
useful if you need to decode a Thumb instruction by hand. We’ve expanded the table
to aid quick manual decode. The table contains instruction definitions up to archi-
tecture THUMBvy3. Any bitmaps not listed are either unpredictable or undefined for
THUMBv3.
