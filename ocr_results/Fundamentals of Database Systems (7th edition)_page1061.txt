27.2.2 Vector Space Model

The vector space model provides a framework in which term weighting, ranking of
retrieved documents, and determining the relevance of feedback are possible.
Using individual terms as dimensions, each document is represented by an
n-dimensional vector of values. The values themselves may be a Boolean value to
represent the existence or absence of the term in that document; alternately, they
may be a number representative of the weight or frequency in the document.
Features are a subset of the terms in a set of documents that are deemed most relevant
to an IR search for this particular set of documents. The process of selecting these
important terms (features) and their properties as a sparse (limited) list out of the
very large number of available terms (the vocabulary can contain hundreds of thou-
sands of terms) is independent of the model specification. The query is also speci-
fied as a terms vector (vector of features), and this is compared to the document
vectors for similarity/relevance assessment.

The similarity assessment function that compares two vectors is not inherent to the
model—different similarity functions can be used. However, the cosine of the angle
between the query and document vector is a commonly used function for similarity
assessment. As the angle between the vectors decreases, the cosine of the angle
approaches one, meaning that the similarity of the query with a document vector
increases. Terms (features) are weighted proportional to their frequency counts to
reflect the importance of terms in the calculation of relevance measure. This is dif-
ferent from the Boolean model, which does not take into account the frequency of
words in the document for relevance match.

In the vector model, the document term weight Wij (for term i in document j) is
represented based on some variation of the TF (term frequency) or TF-IDF (term
frequency-inverse document frequency) scheme (as we will describe below). TF-IDF
is a statistical weight measure that is used to evaluate the importance of a document
word in a collection of documents. The following formula is typically used:

Ml

In the formula given above, we use the following symbols:

cosine(d; ,q)=
il

d; is the document vector for document j.
qis the query vector.

w; is the weight of term i in document j.
Wig is the weight of term i in query vector q.

|V| is the number of dimensions in the vector that is the total number of
important keywords (or features).

TF-IDF uses the product of normalized frequency of a term i (TF,) in document
D and the inverse document frequency of the term i (IDF;) to weight a term in a
