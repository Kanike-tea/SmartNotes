Now, assume that the theorem holds for all graphs with m = k number of edges, where kis
a non-negative integer.

Consider a graph Gy+1 with k + 1 edges and n vertices. First, suppose that Gx+1 has no
cycles in it. Then a diagram of Grs1 Will be of the form shown in Figure 2.21(b)* in which the
number of vertices will be exactly one more than the number of edges, and the diagram will
determine only one region Reo — the entire plane region (as in Figure 2.21(b)). Thus, for Gres
we have, in this case, n = (k+1)+1 and r = 1, so that

n-(k+1)+r=2.

This means that the result (1) is the true when m = k + 1 as well, if Ges contains no cycles i
it.

Next, suppose G;,1 contains at least one cycle. Let r be the number of regions which #
diagram of G,,1 determine. Consider an edge e in a cycle and remove it from Gust: bled
resulting graph, Gj41 — e, will have n vertices and (k + 1) — 1 = k edges, and its diagram will
determine r-1 regions. Since Gy, — e has k edges, the theorem holds for this graph (by
induction assumption made), That is, we have

r-lsk=n+2, or n-(k+l)+r=2.
This means that in this case also the result (1) is true when m = k + 1 as well *
