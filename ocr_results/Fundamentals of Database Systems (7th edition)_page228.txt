join conditions if needed. ORDER BY specifies an order for displaying the results
of a query. Two additional clauses GROUP BY and HAVING will be described in
Section 7.1.8.

In Chapter 7, we will present more complex features of SQL retrieval queries. These
include the following: nested queries that allow one query to be included as part of
another query; aggregate functions that are used to provide summaries of the infor-
mation in the tables; two additional clauses (GROUP BY and HAVING) that can be
used to provide additional power to aggregate functions; and various types of joins
that can combine records from various tables in different ways.

6.4 INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE
Statements in SQL

In SQL, three commands can be used to modify the database: INSERT, DELETE, and
UPDATE. We discuss each of these in turn.

6.4.1 The INSERT Command

In its simplest form, INSERT is used to add a single tuple (row) to a relation (table).
We must specify the relation name and a list of values for the tuple. The values
should be listed in the same order in which the corresponding attributes were speci-
fied in the CREATE TABLE command. For example, to add a new tuple to the
EMPLOYEE relation shown in Figure 5.5 and specified in the CREATE TABLE
EMPLOYEE ... command in Figure 6.1, we can use U1:

U1: INSERTINTO = EMPLOYEE
VALUES ( Richard’, ‘K’, ‘Marini’, 653298653’, ‘1962-12-30’, ‘98
Oak Forest, Katy, TX’, ‘M’, 37000, ‘653298653’, 4 );

A second form of the INSERT statement allows the user to specify explicit attribute
names that correspond to the values provided in the INSERT command. This is use-
ful if a relation has many attributes but only a few of those attributes are assigned
values in the new tuple. However, the values must include all attributes with NOT
NULL specification and no default value. Attributes with NULL allowed or DEFAULT
values are the ones that can be left out. For example, to enter a tuple for a new
EMPLOYEE for whom we know only the Fname, Lname, Dno, and Ssn attributes, we
can use U1A:

U1A: INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (Fname, Lname, Dno, Ssn)
VALUES (‘Richard’, ‘Marini’, 4, “653298653’);

Attributes not specified in U1A are set to their DEFAULT or to NULL, and the values
are listed in the same order as the attributes are listed in the INSERT command itself.
It is also possible to insert into a relation multiple tuples separated by commas in a
single INSERT command. The attribute values forming each tuple are enclosed in
parentheses.
