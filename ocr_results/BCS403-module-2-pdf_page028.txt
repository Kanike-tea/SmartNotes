In general, the DIVISION operation is applied to two relations R(Z) + S(X), where the attributes of
R are a subset of the attributes of S; that is, X © Z.Let Y be the set of attributes of R that are not
attributes of S; that is, Y = Z — X (and hence Z = X U Y). The result of DIVISION is a relation T(Y)
that includes a tuple t if tuples tr appear in R with tr [Y] =t, and with tr [X] = ts for every tuple ts in

S. This means that, for a tuple t to appear in the result T of t

Figure below illustrates a DIVISION operation where Y= {A}, Y= {B}, and Z = {A, B}.

The tuples (values) b1 and 54 appear in R in combination with all three tuples in S; that is why they
appear in the resulting relation 7. All other values of B in R do not appear with all the tuples in S and
are not selected: b2 does not appear with a2, and b3 does not appear with al.

The DIVISION operation can be expressed as a sequence of 2, x, and — operations as follows:

Tl —n{R)
T2 — {Sx T1)—R)
T< T1-T2
