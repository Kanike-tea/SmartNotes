Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design

multilevel indexes. B*-trees have become a commonly accepted default structure
for generating indexes on demand in most relational DBMSs. Section 17.4 is devoted
to alternative ways to access data based on a combination of multiple keys. In Sec-
tion 17.5, we discuss hash indexes and introduce the concept of logical indexes,
which give an additional level of indirection from physical indexes and allow the
physical index to be flexible and extensible in its organization. In Section 17.6, we
discuss multikey indexing and bitmap indexes used for searching on one or more keys.
Section 17.7 covers physical design and Section 7.8 summarizes the chapter.

17.1 Types of Single-Level Ordered Indexes

The idea behind an ordered index is similar to that behind the index used in a text-
book, which lists important terms at the end of the book in alphabetical order along
with a list of page numbers where the term appears in the book. We can search the
book index for a certain term in the textbook to find a list of addresses—page num-
bers in this case—and use these addresses to locate the specified pages first and then
search for the term on each specified page. The alternative, if no other guidance is
given, would be to sift slowly through the whole textbook word by word to find the
term we are interested in; this corresponds to doing a linear search, which scans the
whole file. Of course, most books do have additional information, such as chapter
and section titles, which help us find a term without having to search through the
whole book. However, the index is the only exact indication of the pages where each
term occurs in the book.

For a file with a given record structure consisting of several fields (or attributes), an
index access structure is usually defined on a single field of a file, called an indexing
field (or indexing attribute).! The index typically stores each value of the index field
along with a list of pointers to all disk blocks that contain records with that field
value. The values in the index are ordered so that we can do a binary search on the
index. If both the data file and the index file are ordered, and since the index file is
typically much smaller than the data file, searching the index using a binary search
is a better option. Tree-structured multilevel indexes (see Section 17.2) implement
an extension of the binary search idea that reduces the search space by two-way
partitioning at each search step to an n-ary partitioning approach that divides the
search space in the file n-ways at each stage.

There are several types of ordered indexes. A primary index is specified on the
ordering key field of an ordered file of records. Recall from Section 16.7 that an
ordering key field is used to physically order the file records on disk, and every
record has a unique value for that field. If the ordering field is not a key field—that
is, if numerous records in the file can have the same value for the ordering field—
another type of index, called a clustering index, can be used. The data file is called
a clustered file in this latter case. Notice that a file can have at most one physical
ordering field, so it can have at most one primary index or one clustering index, but

'We use the terms field and attribute interchangeably in this chapter.
