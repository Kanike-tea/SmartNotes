most one department and a department can have at most one manager. The rela-
tionship type WORKS_ON (Figure 3.13) is of cardinality ratio M:N, because the
miniworld rule is that an employee can work on several projects and a project can
have several employees.

Cardinality ratios for binary relationships are represented on ER diagrams by dis-
playing 1, M, and N on the diamonds as shown in Figure 3.2. Notice that in this
notation, we can either specify no maximum (N) or a maximum of one (1) on par-
ticipation. An alternative notation (see Section 3.7.4) allows the designer to specify
a specific maximum number on participation, such as 4 or 5.

Participation Constraints and Existence Dependencies. The participation
constraint specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its being related
to another entity via the relationship type. This constraint specifies the minimum
number of relationship instances that each entity can participate in and is some-
times called the minimum cardinality constraint. There are two types of participa-
tion constraints—total and partial—that we illustrate by example. If a company
policy states that every employee must work for a department, then an employee
entity can exist only if it participates in at least one WORKS_FOR relationship
instance (Figure 3.9). Thus, the participation of EMPLOYEE in WORKS_FOR is
called total participation, meaning that every entity in the total set of employee
entities must be related to a department entity via WORKS_FOR. Total participation
is also called existence dependency. In Figure 3.12 we do not expect every
employee to manage a department, so the participation of EMPLOYEE in the
