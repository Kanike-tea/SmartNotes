2.4 The Database System Environment

buffering of disk pages. The DBMS also interfaces with compilers for general-
purpose host programming languages, and with application servers and client pro-
grams running on separate machines through the system network interface.

2.4.2 Database System Utilities

In addition to possessing the software modules just described, most DBMSs have
database utilities that help the DBA manage the database system. Common utili-
ties have the following types of functions:

= Loading. A loading utility is used to load existing data files—such as text
files or sequential files—into the database. Usually, the current (source) for-
mat of the data file and the desired (target) database file structure are speci-
fied to the utility, which then automatically reformats the data and stores it
in the database. With the proliferation of DBMSs, transferring data from
one DBMS to another is becoming common in many organizations. Some
vendors offer conversion tools that generate the appropriate loading pro-
grams, given the existing source and target database storage descriptions
(internal schemas).

= Backup. A backup utility creates a backup copy of the database, usually by
dumping the entire database onto tape or other mass storage medium. The
backup copy can be used to restore the database in case of catastrophic disk
failure. Incremental backups are also often used, where only changes since
the previous backup are recorded. Incremental backup is more complex, but
saves storage space.

= Database storage reorganization. This utility can be used to reorganize a
set of database files into different file organizations and create new access
paths to improve performance.

= Performance monitoring. Such a utility monitors database usage and pro-
vides statistics to the DBA. The DBA uses the statistics in making decisions
such as whether or not to reorganize files or whether to add or drop indexes
to improve performance.

Other utilities may be available for sorting files, handling data compression,
monitoring access by users, interfacing with the network, and performing other
functions.

2.4.3 Tools, Application Environments,
and Communications Facilities
Other tools are often available to database designers, users, and the DBMS. CASE

tools!? are used in the design phase of database systems. Another tool that can be
quite useful in large organizations is an expanded data dictionary (or data repository)

'2although CASE stands for computer-aided software engineering, many CASE tools are used primarily
for database design.
