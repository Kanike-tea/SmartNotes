By choosing f(x) = =. and g(y) -£ ‘we obtain y = net sinys LZ, ;

Thus the required stream function y = S(yt-# )-e“*siny

5. If Q(z) = log (z-a), z#a represents the complex potential, show that the.
equipotential lines are a family of circles and stream lines are a ‘family of straight lines.

>> Q(z) = log(z-a)
o+iy = log (x+iy—a) = log[(x-a)+iy]
Using log (A+iB) = log VA? +B? +i tan”! (B/A) we have

otiy= log Vix-a)? +12 titan! Ft

o(x, y) = constant and y( x, y) = constant respectively represents equipotential
lines and stream lines. ;

That is, log V(x-a)°+y* = c, (say) and ww 2] = cy (say)

or (x-a)+y? = (e1 and y = (tanc,)x-atanc,

or (x-a ty =? nantly
and y= mxte +++(2)

where r, m, c are all arbitrary constants. It is evident that (1) is a circle with centre
(a, 0) and radiusr and (2) isa straight line.

This proves the required result.
