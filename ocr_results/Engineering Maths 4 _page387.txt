Sampling Distributions

Let us suppose that we have different samples of size n drawn from a population. For
each and every sample-of size n we can compute quantities like mean, standard
deviation etc. Obviously these will not be the same. Suppose we group these,
characteristics according to their frequencies, the frequency distributions so generated
are called sampling distributions. These canbe distinguished as sampling distribution

of mean, standard deviation ete. The sanipling distribution of large samples is assumed to
be a normal distribution. : |

The standard deviation of asampling distribution is also called theStandard Error (S.E). °

The reciprocal of the standard error is called precision.
¢ Sampling distribution of the means .
Sample mean is a statistic and we discuss the sampling distribution of this statistic.

We consider all possible random samples of size n and determine the meari of each

one of these samples. We discuss the sampling distribution of the sample means for
the two possible types of random sampling (with/without replacment) ‘associated with
afinite population. ' ea i 8 ew i

Case - (1) Random sampling with replacement. -

Here the items are drawn one by one and. are put back to the population before
the next draw. If N is the size of the finite population and n is the size of the sample

then we have N” samples.

The mean jz of the frequency distribution of the sample means will be equal to the
population mean (1). . .

The variance 02 of the frequency distribution of the sample means, will be equai to
0°/n where 0° is the variance of the population. 1

Thus we have, Wz =p and oe =0/n

oz isalso called the standard error of thé means.

Case - (2) Random sampling without replacement -

Here the items are drawn one by one and are not put back to the population before the
next draw. In this case there willbe N. samples and we have the following results
