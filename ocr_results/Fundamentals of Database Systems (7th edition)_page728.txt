698 — Chapter 19 Query Optimization

definition here. We will state some transformation rules that are useful in query
optimization, without proving them:

1. Cascade of o. A conjunctive selection condition can be broken up into a
cascade (that is, a sequence) of individual 6 operations:
Ge, AND cy AND... AND ¢,,(R) = Ge, (Ge, (---(6,,,(R))---))

2. Commutativity of o. The 6 operation is commutative:
Ge, (G.,(R)) = Ge, (6-,(R))

3. Cascade of m. In a cascade (sequence) of 1 operations, all but the last one
can be ignored:

Mist Mist, (---Mrist,,(R))---)) = Mist, (R)

4. Commuting o with 1. If the selection condition c involves only those attri-
butes Aj, ... , Ay in the projection list, the two operations can be commuted:

TAs Ay oA (Oe (R)) = Oe (MAy, Ay, ... A, (R))

5. Commutativity of p< (and x). The join operation is commutative, as is the x

operation:
Ro, S=Sm,R
RxS=SxXR

Notice that although the order of attributes may not be the same in the rela-
tions resulting from the two joins (or two Cartesian products), the meaning
is the same because the order of attributes is not important in the alternative
definition of relation.

6. Commuting o with > (or x). Ifall the attributes in the selection condition c
involve only the attributes of one of the relations being joined—say, R—the
two operations can be commuted as follows:

G, (RoaS) = (6, (R)) pa S
Alternatively, if the selection condition c can be written as (c, AND cz), where

condition c; involves only the attributes of R and condition c, involves only
the attributes of S, the operations commute as follows:

G, (Rea S) = (6,, (R)) » (G-, (S))
The same rules apply if the > is replaced by a x operation.

7. Commuting x with » (or x). Suppose that the projection list is L={Aj, ...,
Aj By, ... , By}, where Aj, ... , A,, are attributes of R and B,, ... , B,, are
attributes of S. If the join condition c involves only attributes in L, the two
operations can be commuted as follows:

Ty (Ro S) = (Tay, ..., A, (R)) Pte (ay, ...B,, (S))

If the join condition c contains additional attributes not in L, these must be added
to the projection list, and a final z operation is needed. For example, if attributes
