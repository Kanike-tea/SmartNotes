DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

2. Destroy: The Destroy operation destroys the memory space allocated for the specified
data structure.

3. Selection: The Selection operation deals with accessing a particular data within a data
structure.

4. Updating: The Update operation updates or modifies the data in the data structure.

5. Searching: The Searching operation finds the presence of the desired data item in the

list of data items.

6. Sorting: Sorting is the process of arranging all the data items in the data structure in a
particular order, say for example, either in ascending order or in descending order.
7. Merging: Merging is a process of combing the data items of two different sorted list

into a single list.

REVIEW OF POINTERS AND DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION

Pointers to data significantly improve performance for repetitive operations such as
traversing strings, lookup tables, control tables and tree structures. In particular, it is often
much cheaper in time and space to copy and dereference pointers than it is to copy and access
the data to which the pointers point. Pointers are also used to hold the addresses of entry
points for called subroutines in procedural programming and for run-time linking to dynamic
link libraries (DLLs).

Pointer: A pointer is a special variable which contains address of a memory location. Using
this pointer, the data can be accessed. For example, assume that a program contains four
occurrences of a constant 3.1459. During the compilation process, four copies of 3.1459 can

be created as shown below:

However, it is more efficient to use one copy of 3.1459 and three pointers referencing a
single copy, since less space is required for a pointer when compared to floating point

number. This can be represented pictorially as shown below:
