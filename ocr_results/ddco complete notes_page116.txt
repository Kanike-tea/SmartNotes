The following steps are necessary to transfer the bus mastership from CPU to
one of the DMAcontroller:

The DMA controller request the processor to obtain the bus mastership by
activating BR (Busrequest) signal

In response to this-signal the CPU transfers the bus mastership to

requested devices DMAcontroller1 in the form of BG (Bus grant).

When the bus mastership is obtained from CPU the DMA controller1 blocks the
propagation of busgrant signal from one device to another device.

The BG signal is connected to DMA controller2 from DMA controller1 in as daisy
fashion style isas shown in the figure.

When the DMA controllerl has not sent BR request, it transfers the bus
mastership to DMAcontroller2 by unblocking bus grant signal.

When the DMA controller1 receives the bus grant signal, it blocks the signal from
passing to DMA controller2 and enables BBSY signal. When BBSY signal is set to 1
the set of devices connected to system bus doesn’t have any rights to obtain the bus
mastership from the CPU.

e In this technique 2 or more devices trying to.access system bus at the same
time may participatein bus arbitration process.
e The schematic diagram of distributed bus arbitration is as shown in the figure
