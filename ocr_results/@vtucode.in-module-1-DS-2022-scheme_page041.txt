DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

Delete an item in a stack

element delete(int *top)
{
/* return the top element from the stack */
if (*top == -1)
return stack-empty(); /* returns an error key */
return stack[(*top)--];

For deletion, the stack-empty function should print an error message and return an item of

type element with a key field that contains an error code.

STACK USING DYNAMIC ARRAYS

+ Shortcoming of static stack implementation: is the need to know at compile-time, a good
bound(MAX_STACK_ SIZE) on how large the stack will become.
+ This shortcoming can be overcome by

— using a dynamically allocated array for the elements &

— then increasing the size of the array as needed
+ Initially, capacityn=1 where capacity=maximum no; of stack-elements that may be stored in
array.

* The CreateS() function can be implemented as follows

Stack CreateS (max-stack-size") ::=
#define MAX-STACK-SIZE 100 /*maximum stack size */
typedef, struct
{
int’ key;
/* other fields */
} element;

element stack [MAX—STACK-SIZE];

int top - -1;
Boolean IsEmpty(Stack) ::= top <0;
Boolean IsFullI (Stack) ::= top >= MAX-STACK-SIZE-1;

* Once the stack is full, realloc() function is used to increase the size of array.
+ In array-doubling, we double array-capacity whenever it becomes necessary to increase the

capacity of an array.
