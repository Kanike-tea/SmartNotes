Query by Example (QBE)

Query by Example (QBE) is a method of query creation that allows the user to search for
documents based on an example in the form of a selected text string or in the form of a document
name or a list of documents. Because the QBE system formulates the actual query, QBE is easier to
learn than formal query languages, such as the standard Structured Query Language (SQL), while
still enabling powerful searches.

Selections in QBE
QBE uses skeleton tables to represent table name and fieldnames like:

Table name Field1 Field2 ne

For selection, P operator along with variable name/constant name is used to display one or more
fields.

Example 1:

Consider the relation: student (name, roll, marks)

The following query can be represented as:

SQL: select name from student where marks>50;

student name roll marks
P.X >50

Here X is a constant; alternatively we can use _X as a variable.

Example 2:

For the relation given above
The following query can be represented as:

SQL: select * from student where marks>50 and marks <80;
student name roll marks
P. _X
CONDITION
_X>50 A _X<80

We can use condition box to represent complex conditions.
Example 3:

For the relation given above

The following query can be represented as:

SQL: select name, roll from student where marks<50 or marks >80;

student name roll marks
PA PB <50
PA PB >80

OR operation retrieves results in multiple rows.

Example 4:

(Joins in QBE)

Consider the following tables:

Student (name, roll, marks)

Grades (roll, grade)

The following query can be represented as:
