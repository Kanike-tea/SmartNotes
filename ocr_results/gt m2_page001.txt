exactly once? Such a walk is now called an Euler line, and a graph that consists
of an Euler line is called an Euler graph. More formally:

If some closed walk in a graph contains all the edges of the graph, then the
walk is called an Euler line and the graph an Euler graph.

By its very definition a walk is always connected. Since the Euler line (which
is a walk) contains all the edges of the graph, an Euler graph is always
connected, except for any isolated vertices the graph may have. Since isolated
vertices do not contribute anything to the understanding of an Euler graph, it is
hereafter assumed that Euler graphs do not have any isolated vertices and are
therefore connected.

Now we shall state and prove an important theorem, which will enable us to
tell immediately whether or not a given graph is an Euler graph.

THEOREM 2-4

A given connected graph G is an Euler graph if and only if all vertices of G
are of even degree.

Proof: Suppose that G is an Euler graph. It therefore contains an Euler line
(which is a closed walk). In tracing this walk we observe that every time the
walk meets a vertex v it goes through two “new” edges incident on v—with one
we “entered” v and with the other “exited.” This is true not only of all
intermediate vertices of the walk but also of the terminal vertex, because we
“exited” and “entered” the same vertex at the beginning and end of the walk,
respectively. Thus if G is an Euler graph, the degree of every vertex is even.

To prove the sufficiency of the condition, assume that all vertices of G are of
even degree. Now we construct a walk starting at an arbitrary vertex v and going
through the edges of G such that no edge is traced more than once. We continue
tracing as far as possible. Since every vertex is of even degree, we can exit from
every vertex we enter; the tracing cannot stop at any vertex but v. And since v is
also of even degree, we shall eventually reach v when the tracing comes to an
end. If this closed walk h we just traced includes all the edges of G, G is an Euler
graph. If not, we remove from G all the edges in h and obtain a subgraph h' of G
formed by the remaining edges. Since both G and h have all their vertices of
even degree, the degrees of the vertices of h' are also even. Moreover, h' must
touch h at least at one vertex a, because G is connected. Starting from a, we can
again construct a new walk in graph h’. Since all the vertices of h’ are of even
degree, this walk in h’ must terminate at vertex a; but this walk in h' can be
combined with h to form a new walk, which starts and ends at vertex v and has
