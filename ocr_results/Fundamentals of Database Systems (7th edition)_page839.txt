Compare binary locks to exclusive/shared locks. Why is the latter type of
locks preferable?

Describe the wait-die and wound-wait protocols for deadlock prevention.

Describe the cautious waiting, no waiting, and timeout protocols for dead-
lock prevention.

What is a timestamp? How does the system generate timestamps?

Discuss the timestamp ordering protocol for concurrency control. How
does strict timestamp ordering differ from basic timestamp ordering?

Discuss two multiversion techniques for concurrency control. What is a cer-
tify lock? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using certify locks?

How do optimistic concurrency control techniques differ from other con-
currency control techniques? Why are they also called validation or certifi-
cation techniques? Discuss the typical phases of an optimistic concurrency
control method.

What is snapshot isolation? What are the advantages and disadvantages of
concurrency control methods that are based on snapshot isolation?

How does the granularity of data items affect the performance of concurrency
control? What factors affect selection of granularity size for data items?

What type of lock is needed for insert and delete operations?

What is multiple granularity locking? Under what circumstances is it used?
What are intention locks?

When are latches used?

What is a phantom record? Discuss the problem that a phantom record can
cause for concurrency control.

How does index locking resolve the phantom problem?

What is a predicate lock?

ability of schedules. (Hint: Show that if a serializability graph for a schedule
has a cycle, then at least one of the transactions participating in the schedule
does not obey the two-phase locking protocol.)

Modify the data structures for multiple-mode locks and the algorithms for
read_lock(X), write_lock(X), and unlock(X) so that upgrading and downgrad-
ing of locks are possible. (Hint: The lock needs to check the transaction id(s)
that hold the lock, if any.)
