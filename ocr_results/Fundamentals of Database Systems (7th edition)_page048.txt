18 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

accounting office keeps data on registration and related billing information,
whereas the registration office keeps track of student courses and grades. Other
groups may further duplicate some or all of the same data in their own files.

This redundancy in storing the same data multiple times leads to several problems.
First, there is the need to perform a single logical update—such as entering data on
a new student—multiple times: once for each file where student data is recorded.
This leads to duplication of effort. Second, storage space is wasted when the same
data is stored repeatedly, and this problem may be serious for large databases.
Third, files that represent the same data may become inconsistent. This may happen
because an update is applied to some of the files but not to others. Even if an
update—such as adding a new student—is applied to all the appropriate files, the
data concerning the student may still be inconsistent because the updates are applied
independently by each user group. For example, one user group may enter a stu-
dent’s birth date erroneously as ‘JAN-19-1988’, whereas the other user groups may
enter the correct value of ‘JAN-29-1988’.

In the database approach, the views of different user groups are integrated during
database design. Ideally, we should have a database design that stores each logical
data item—such as a student’s name or birth date—in only one place in the data-
base. This is known as data normalization, and it ensures consistency and saves
storage space (data normalization is described in Part 6 of the text).

However, in practice, it is sometimes necessary to use controlled redundancy to
improve the performance of queries. For example, we may store Student_name and
Course_number redundantly in a GRADE_REPORT file (Figure 1.6(a)) because
whenever we retrieve a GRADE_REPORT record, we want to retrieve the student
name and course number along with the grade, student number, and section identi-
fier. By placing all the data together, we do not have to search multiple files to col-
lect this data. This is known as denormalization. In such cases, the DBMS should
