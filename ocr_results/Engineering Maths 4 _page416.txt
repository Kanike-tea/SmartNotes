29. One type of aircraft is is found to develop engine trouble in 5 flights out of a total of 100 and
another type in 7 flights out of a total of 200 flights. Is there a significant difference in the
two types of aircrafts so far as engine defects are concerned ?

_ >> Let p, and p, be the Proportion of defects in the two types of aircrafts.

Tap = 095: Pa = 399 = 0.085

Py = 1
_H) is the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the two type of
aircrafts.

Thus the null hypothesis is accepted both at 5 % and 1 % Jevels of significance.

30. Random sample of 1000 engineering students from a city A and 800 from city B were

taken. It was found that 400 students in each of the sample were from payment quota.
Does the data reveal a significant difference between the two cities in respect of payment

quota students?
