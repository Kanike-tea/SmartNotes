15.1 Further Topics in Functional Dependencies: Inference Rules, Equivalence, and Minimal Cover

FD2: Course# — Credit_hrs;

FD3: {Course#, Instr_name} — Text, Classroom;
FD4: Text — Publisher

FDS: Classroom — Capacity

Note that the above FDs express certain semantics about the data in the relation
CLASS. For example, FD1 states that each class has a unique Classid. FD3 states
that when a given course is offered by a certain instructor, the text is fixed and the
instructor teaches that class in a fixed room. Using the inference rules about the
FDs and applying the definition of closure, we can define the following closures:

{ Classid } * = { Classid , Course#, Instr_name, Credit_hrs, Text, Publisher,
Classroom, Capacity } = CLASS

{ Course#} * = { Course#, Credit_hrs}

{ Course#, Instr_name } * = { Course#, Credit_hrs, Text, Publisher,
Classroom, Capacity }

Note that each closure above has an interpretation that is revealing about the
attribute(s) on the left-hand side. For example, the closure of Course# has only
Credit_hrs besides itself. It does not include Instr_name because different instruc-
tors could teach the same course; it does not include Text because different instruc-
tors may use different texts for the same course. Note also that the closure of
{Course#, Instr_nam} does not include Classid, which implies that it is not a candi-
date key. This further implies that a course with given Course# could be offered by
different instructors, which would make the courses distinct classes.

15.1.2 Equivalence of Sets of Functional Dependencies

In this section, we discuss the equivalence of two sets of functional dependencies.
First, we give some preliminary definitions.

Definition. A set of functional dependencies F is said to cover another set of
functional dependencies E if every FD in E is also in F*; that is, if every
dependency in E can be inferred from F, alternatively, we can say that E is
covered by F.

Definition. Two sets of functional dependencies E and F are equivalent if
E* = F*. Therefore, equivalence means that every FD in E can be inferred from
F, and every FD in F can be inferred from E; that is, E is equivalent to F if both
the conditions—E covers F and F covers E—hold.

We can determine whether F covers E by calculating X* with respect to F for each
FD X > Y in E, and then checking whether this X* includes the attributes in Y. If
this is the case for every FD in E, then F covers E. We determine whether E and F are
equivalent by checking that E covers F and F covers E. It is left to the reader as an
exercise to show that the following two sets of FDs are equivalent:

F={A—>C,AC—> D, E- AD, E> H}
and G = {A > CD, E> AH}
