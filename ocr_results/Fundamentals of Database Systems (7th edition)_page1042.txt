management system. Whenever the inference mechanism needs to compute the fact
set corresponding to a nonrecursive rule-defined predicate p, it first locates all the
rules that have p as their head. The idea is to compute the fact set for each such rule
and then to apply the UNION operation to the results, since UNION corresponds to a
logical OR operation. The dependency graph indicates all predicates q on which each
p depends, and since we assume that the predicate is nonrecursive, we can always
determine a partial order among such predicates q. Before computing the fact set for
P, first we compute the fact sets for all predicates q on which p depends, based on their
partial order. For example, ifa query involves the predicate UNDER_40K_SUPERVISOR,
we must first compute both SUPERVISOR and OVER_40K_EMP. Since the latter two
depend only on the fact-defined predicates EMPLOYEE, SALARY, and SUPERVISE,
they can be computed directly from the stored database relations.

This concludes our introduction to deductive databases. Additional material may be
found at the book’s Web site, where the complete Chapter 25 from the third edition is
available. Information on the Web site includes a discussion on algorithms for recur-
sive query processing. We have included an extensive bibliography of work in deduc-
tive databases, recursive query processing, magic sets, combination of relational
databases with deductive rules, and GLUE-NAIL! System, at the end of this chapter.

26.6 Summary

In this chapter, we introduced database concepts for some of the common features
that are needed by advanced applications: active databases, temporal databases,
spatial databases, multimedia databases, and deductive databases. It is important to
note that each of these is a broad topic and warrants a complete textbook.
