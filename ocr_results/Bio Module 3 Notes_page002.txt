Similarly, a computer's CPU also has memory units for storing information, and the human brain
has several regions dedicated to memory storage, including the hippocampus and amygdala.

While the comparison between the human brain and a computer's CPU can provide useful insights,
it is important to note that the human brain is a vastly more complex and capable system, with
many functions that are still not fully understood.

Human Nervous System

In the human body, the neural system integrates the activities of organs based on the stimuli, which
the neurons detect and transmit. They transmit messages in the form of electrical impulses and
convey messages to and from the sense organs. Thus, the nervous coordination involves the
participation of the sense organs, nerves, spinal cord, and brain.
