The Relational Data Model and
Relational Database Constraints

Th chapter opens Part 3 of the book, which covers
relational databases. The relational data model was
first introduced by Ted Codd of IBM Research in 1970 in a classic paper (Codd,
1970), and it attracted immediate attention due to its simplicity and mathematical
foundation. The model uses the concept of a mathematical relation—which looks
somewhat like a table of values—as its basic building block, and has its theoretical
basis in set theory and first-order predicate logic. In this chapter we discuss the
basic characteristics of the model and its constraints.

The first commercial implementations of the relational model became available in
the early 1980s, such as the SQL/DS system on the MVS operating system by IBM
and the Oracle DBMS. Since then, the model has been implemented in a large num-
ber of commercial systems, as well as a number of open source systems. Current
popular commercial relational DBMSs (RDBMSs) include DB2 (from IBM), Oracle
(from Oracle), Sybase DBMS (now from SAP), and SQLServer and Microsoft
Access (from Microsoft). In addition, several open source systems, such as MySQL
and PostgreSQL, are available.

Because of the importance of the relational model, all of Part 2 is devoted to this
model and some of the languages associated with it. In Chapters 6 and 7, we describe
some aspects of SQL, which is a comprehensive model and language that is the
standard for commercial relational DBMSs. (Additional aspects of SQL will be cov-
ered in other chapters.) Chapter 8 covers the operations of the relational algebra and
introduces the relational calculus—these are two formal languages associated with
the relational model. The relational calculus is considered to be the basis for the
SQL language, and the relational algebra is used in the internals of many database
implementations for query processing and optimization (see Part 8 of the book).
