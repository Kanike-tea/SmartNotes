PREFACE

Python is a high-level, interpreted, reflective, dynamically typed, open source, multi-paradigm
and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It is quite powerful
and easy. It offers no special tools or features that let you do things that you cannot do with
other languages, but its elegant design and combination of certain features make Python a

pleasure to use.

This laboratory manual is designed to help all stakeholders, especially the students, teachers,
and instructors to develop in the student the pre-determined outcomes. It is expected from each
student that at least a day in advance, they have to thoroughly read the concerned practical
procedure that they will do the next day and understand the minimum theoretical background
associated with the practical. Every practical in this manual begins by identifying the
competency, industry-relevant skills, course outcomes, and practical outcomes which serve as
a key focal point for doing the practical. Students will then become aware about the skills they
will achieve through the procedure shown there the and necessary precautions to be taken,

which will help them to apply in solving real-world problems in their professional life.

This manual also provides guidelines to teachers and instructors to effectively facilitate
student-centered lab activities through each practical exercise by arranging and managing
necessary resources in order that the students follow the procedures and precautions

systematically ensuring the achievement of outcomes in the students.

Although all care has been taken to check for mistakes in this laboratory manual, yet it is
impossible to claim perfection especially as this is the first edition. Any such errors and

suggestions for improvement can be brought to our notice and are highly welcome.
