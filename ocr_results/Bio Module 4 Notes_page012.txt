The development of photovoltaics has been heavily influenced by the natural process of
photosynthesis, and many researchers have sought to mimic and improve upon the efficiency and
effectiveness of photosynthesis in order to develop more advanced and efficient photovoltaic
systems. The study of photosynthesis has thus played a significant role in the development of
sustainable energy systems and continues to be an important area of research in the field of
renewable energy.

New Technology Photovoltaic Cells

Photovoltaic cells, also known as solar cells, are devices that convert light energy from the
sun into electrical energy. The technology behind photovoltaic cells has advanced significantly in
recent years, leading to the development of new and improved photovoltaic cell designs and
materials.

Some of the new technologies in photovoltaic cells include:

e  Perovskite solar cells: Perovskite solar cells are a new type of photovoltaic cell that use a
crystalline material made of perovskite to convert light energy into electrical energy. They
are highly efficient and have the potential to be more affordable than traditional silicon-
