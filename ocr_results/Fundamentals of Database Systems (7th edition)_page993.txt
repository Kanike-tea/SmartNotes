26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers

Rules that specify actions that are automatically triggered by certain events have
been considered important enhancements to database systems for quite some time.
In fact, the concept of triggers—a technique for specifying certain types of active
rules—has existed in early versions of the SQL specification for relational databases,
and triggers are now part of the SQL-99 and later standards. Commercial relational
DBMSs—such as Oracle, DB2, and Microsoft SQLServer—have various versions of
triggers available. However, much research into what a general model for active
databases should look like has been done since the early models of triggers were
proposed. In Section 26.1.1, we will present the general concepts that have been
proposed for specifying rules for active databases. We will use the syntax of the
Oracle commercial relational DBMS to illustrate these concepts with specific exam-
ples, since Oracle triggers are close to the way rules are specified in the SQL stan-
dard. Section 26.1.2 will discuss some general design and implementation issues for
active databases. We give examples of how active databases are implemented in the
STARBURST experimental DBMS in Section 26.1.3, since STARBURST provides
for many of the concepts of generalized active databases within its framework. Sec-
tion 26.1.4 discusses possible applications of active databases. Finally, Section 26.1.5
describes how triggers are declared in the SQL-99 standard.

26.1.1 Generalized Model for Active Databases
and Oracle Triggers

The model that has been used to specify active database rules is referred to as
the event-condition-action (ECA) model. A rule in the ECA model has three
components:

1. The event(s) that triggers the rule: These events are usually database
update operations that are explicitly applied to the database. However, in
the general model, they could also be temporal events” or other kinds of
external events.

2. The condition that determines whether the rule action should be executed:
Once the triggering event has occurred, an optional condition may be evalu-
ated. If no condition is specified, the action will be executed once the event

2An example would be a temporal event specified as a periodic time, such as: Trigger this rule every day
at 5:30 am.
