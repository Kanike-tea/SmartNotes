In addition, the catalog stores many other types of information that are needed by
the DBMS modules, which can then look up the catalog information as needed.

Casual users and persons with occasional need for information from the database
interact using the interactive query interface in Figure 2.3. We have not explicitly
shown any menu-based or form-based or mobile interactions that are typically used

These queries are parsed and validated for correctness of the query syntax, the
names of files and data elements, and so on by a query compiler that compiles
