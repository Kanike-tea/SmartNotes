In other words,

n=3: A>C, AB, CB, A>C, B>A, BoC, A>C

For completeness, the solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem for n= 1
and n= 2 n=l: A>C
n=2: A>B, A>C, BC
The Towers of Hanoi problem for n> 1 disks may be reduced to the following sub-
problems:
(1) Move the top n - | disks from peg A to peg B
(2) Move the top disk from peg A to peg C: AC.
(3) Move the top n - 1 disks from peg B to peg C.

The general notation
e TOWER (N, BEG, AUX, END) to denote a procedure which moves the top n
disks from the initial peg BEG to the final peg END using the peg AUX as an
auxiliary.
e When n = I, the solution:
TOWER (1, BEG, AUX, END) consists of the single instruction BEG--END
e When n> 1, the solution may be reduced to the solution of the following
three sub- problems:
(a) TOWER (N -I, BEG, END, AUX)
(b) TOWER (1, BEG, AUX, END) or BEG — END
(c) TOWER (N =I, AUX, BEG, END)

void Hanoi(int n, char x, char y, char z)
{
if (n > 1)
{
Hanoi (n-1,x,Z,y)7
printf ("Move disk %d from %c to %c.\n",n,x,Z);
Hanoi (n-1,y,x,z)7
}
else
{
printf ("Move disk %d from %c to %c.\n",n,x,Z);

}
