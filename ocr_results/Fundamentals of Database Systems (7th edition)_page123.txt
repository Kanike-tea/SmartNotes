3.10 Another Example: A UNIVERSITY Database

= A department offers a number of courses (COURSE), each of which has a
unique course name (CoName), a unique code number (CCode), a course
level (Level: this can be coded as 1 for freshman level, 2 for sophomore, 3 for
junior, 4 for senior, 5 for MS level, and 6 for PhD level), a course credit
hours (Credits), and a course description (CDesc). The database also keeps
track of instructors (INSTRUCTOR); and each instructor has a unique iden-
tifier (Id), name (IName), office (IOffice), phone (IPhone), and rank (Rank);
in addition, each instructor works for one primary academic department.

= The database will keep student data (STUDENT) and stores each student’s
name (SName, composed of first name (FName), middle name (MName),
last name (LName)), student id (Sid, unique for every student), address
(Addr), phone (Phone), major code (Major), and date of birth (DoB). A stu-
dent is assigned to one primary academic department. It is required to keep
track of the student’s grades in each section the student has completed.

= Courses are offered as sections (SECTION). Each section is related to a single
course and a single instructor and has a unique section identifier (Secld). A
section also has a section number (SecNo: this is coded as 1, 2, 3, .. . for mul-
tiple sections offered during the same semester/year), semester (Sem), year
(Year), classroom (CRoom: this is coded as a combination of building code
(Bldg) and room number (RoomNo) within the building), and days/times
(DaysTime: for example, ‘MWF 9am-9.50am’ or “TR 3.30pm-5.20pm’—
restricted to only allowed days/time values). (Note: The database will keep
track of all the sections offered for the past several years, in addition to the
current offerings. The Secld is unique for all sections, not just the sections for
a particular semester.) The database keeps track of the students in each section,
and the grade is recorded when available (this is a many-to-many relationship
between students and sections). A section must have at least five students.

The ER diagram for these requirements is shown in Figure 3.20 using the min-max ER
diagrammatic notation. Notice that for the SECTION entity type, we only showed
SecID as an underlined key, but because of the miniworld constraints, several other
combinations of values have to be unique for each section entity. For example, each of
the following combinations must be unique based on the typical miniworld constraints:

1. (SecNo, Sem, Year, CCode (of the COURSE related to the SECTION)): This
specifies that the section numbers of a particular course must be different
during each particular semester and year.

N

. (Sem, Year, CRoom, DaysTime): This specifies that in a particular semester
and year, a classroom cannot be used by two different sections at the same
days/time.

3. (Sem, Year, DaysTime, Id (of the INSTRUCTOR teaching the SECTION)):

This specifies that in a particular semester and year, an instructor cannot

teach two sections at the same days/time. Note that this rule will not apply if

an instructor is allowed to teach two combined sections together in the par-
ticular university.

Can you think of any other attribute combinations that have to be unique?
