Numerical solution of. second order ordinary differential equations
, ‘Antepduction and pre-amble

The given second order ODE with two initial conditions will reduce to two first order
Simultaneous ODEs which can be solved. -

We present the method explicitly.

Let y” = a(x, y,y’) with the inital conditions ¥(%) = Yo and y’ (x) = Yo
be the given second onder DE. .

Now, Jet y = fas this pres y™ a: -—
The given second order DE assumes the form : a = 8%, ¥, Z) with the conditions

, ¥(%) = Yo ‘and z(%) = 9 where Yo, isbe denoted by 25.
Hence we now have two first onder simultaneous ODEs,

at = 2. and a a y, Z) with ¥(X%) = Yo and 2(%) =z

Faking f(x, y, Z) = z,wenowhave the following system of equations forsolving.
