Additionally, smart biomaterials can respond to environmental stimuli, enhancing scaffold
functionality.

Therefore, the skeletal and muscular systems are natural scaffolds that exhibit remarkable
mechanical and biological properties, serving as models for developing synthetic scaffolds in
tissue engineering. Understanding their architecture—both macro and micro—is essential for
creating materials that can integrate with the human body and support tissue regeneration
effectively. By mimicking nature’s design, researchers aim to develop scaffolds that restore
function in damaged bones and muscles, promoting healing and improving patient outcomes.

Ans. (a) GPS system existing in birds

Biomimicry, or the practice of using designs and processes found in nature to solve human
problems, has led to the development of various technologies inspired by birds' flight. Some
examples include:

: Wing design: The shape of bird wings has inspired the design of aircraft wings, which
have evolved to be more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient as a result. The study of bird flight
has also led to the development of winglets, small structures at the tip of wings that reduce drag
and increase lift.

: Flapping-wing drones: Researchers have developed drones that use flapping wings to
fly, mimicking the way birds and insects fly. These drones can be used for various applications,
such as monitoring crops and wildlife, inspecting buildings and infrastructure, and search and
rescue operations.

: Soaring algorithms: Soaring refers to the flight technique used by birds and certain
aircraft to stay aloft and travel long distances with minimal energy expenditure. It involves
utilizing rising air currents, such as thermals, ridge lift, wind shear, or atmospheric waves, to
gain altitude and maintain flight. Birds use thermals, or columns of rising warm air, to gain
altitude and soar. Researchers have developed algorithms inspired by bird flight to help gliders
and other aircraft use thermals more efficiently, leading to longer and more sustainable flights.

: Landing gear: The legs and feet of birds have inspired the design of landing gear for
aircraft, with shock-absorbing and retractable structures that help absorb impact upon landing.
