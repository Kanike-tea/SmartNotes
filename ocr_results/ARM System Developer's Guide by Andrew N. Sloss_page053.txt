2.7.1. ARM7 FAMILY

The ARM7 core has a Von Neumann-style architecture, where both data and instructions
use the same bus. The core has a three-stage pipeline and executes the architecture ARMv4T
instruction set.

The ARM7TDMI was the first of a new range of processors introduced in 1995 by ARM.
It is currently a very popular core and is used in many 32-bit embedded processors. It
provides a very good performance-to-power ratio. The ARM7TDMI processor core has
been licensed by many of the top semiconductor companies around the world and is
the first core to include the Thumb instruction set, a fast multiply instruction, and the
EmbeddedICE debug technology.
