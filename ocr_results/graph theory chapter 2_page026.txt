Does there exist a'simple planar graph with five regions such tat there le an
edge between every pair of regions?
p Suppose there is a simple planar graph G of the desired type! Then, its dual G* will have
five vertices such that there is an edge between every pair of vertices, This means that G* =
Ks. Consequently, it follows that G* is nonplanar and therefore G is nonplanar. This is a
Hence, a simple planar graph of the desired type does not exist, .
Prove that the sum of the degrees of the regions of a planar graph G is equal to
twice the number of edges in G,
» Consider the dual G* of the given graph G. By the handshaking property, the sum of the
degrees of the vertices of G* is equal to the number of edges in G*. Since the degree of a vertex
in G" is equal to the degree of the corresponding region in G and since there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the edges in G” and those in G, it follows that the sum of the degrees
of the regions of G is equal to twice the number of edges in G. .
