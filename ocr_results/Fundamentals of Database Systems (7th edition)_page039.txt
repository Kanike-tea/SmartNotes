1.2 An Example

single character from the set {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘F’, ‘}. We may also use a coding
scheme to represent the values of a data item. For example, in Figure 1.2 we rep-
resent the Class of a STUDENT as 1 for freshman, 2 for sophomore, 3 for junior,
4 for senior, and 5 for graduate student.

To construct the UNIVERSITY database, we store data to represent each student,
course, section, grade report, and prerequisite as a record in the appropriate file.
Notice that records in the various files may be related. For example, the record for
Smith in the STUDENT file is related to two records in the GRADE_REPORT file that
specify Smith’s grades in two sections. Similarly, each record in the PREREQUISITE
file relates two course records: one representing the course and the other represent-
ing the prerequisite. Most medium-size and large databases include many types of
records and have many relationships among the records.

Database manipulation involves querying and updating. Examples of queries are as
follows:

= Retrieve the transcript—a list of all courses and grades—of ‘Smith’

= List the names of students who took the section of the ‘Database’ course
offered in fall 2008 and their grades in that section

= List the prerequisites of the ‘Database’ course
Examples of updates include the following:

= Change the class of ‘Smith’ to sophomore
= Create a new section for the ‘Database’ course for this semester
= Enter a grade of ‘A’ for ‘Smith’ in the ‘Database’ section of last semester

These informal queries and updates must be specified precisely in the query lan-
guage of the DBMS before they can be processed.

At this stage, it is useful to describe the database as part of a larger undertaking
known as an information system within an organization. The Information Tech-
nology (IT) department within an organization designs and maintains an informa-
tion system consisting of various computers, storage systems, application software,
and databases. Design of a new application for an existing database or design of a
brand new database starts off with a phase called requirements specification and
analysis. These requirements are documented in detail and transformed into a
conceptual design that can be represented and manipulated using some comput-
erized tools so that it can be easily maintained, modified, and transformed into a
database implementation. (We will introduce a model called the Entity-Relation-
ship model in Chapter 3 that is used for this purpose.) The design is then translated
to a logical design that can be expressed in a data model implemented in a com-
mercial DBMS. (Various types of DBMSs are discussed throughout the text, with an
emphasis on relational DBMSs in Chapters 5 through 9.)

The final stage is physical design, during which further specifications are provided for
storing and accessing the database. The database design is implemented, populated
with actual data, and continuously maintained to reflect the state of the miniworld.
