Results of two natural join operations. (a) proj_dept < project « dept.
(b) dept_locs < department + dept_locations.

Notice that if no combination of tuples satisfies the join condition, the result of a
JOIN is an empty relation with zero tuples. In general, if R has ng tuples and S has
ng tuples, the result of a JOIN operation R > join condition> § Will have between zero
and ng * ng tuples. The expected size of the join result divided by the maximum
size np * ns leads to a ratio called join selectivity, which is a property of each join
condition. If there is no join condition, all combinations of tuples qualify and the
JOIN degenerates into a CARTESIAN PRODUCT, also called CROSS PRODUCT or
CROSS JOIN.

As we can see, a single JOIN operation is used to combine data from two relations so
that related information can be presented in a single table. These operations are
also known as inner joins, to distinguish them from a different join variation called
outer joins (see Section 8.4.4). Informally, an inner join is a type of match-and-
combine operation defined formally as a combination of CARTESIAN PRODUCT
and SELECTION. Note that sometimes a join may be specified between a relation
and itself, as we will illustrate in Section 8.4.3. The NATURAL JOIN or EQUUOIN
operation can also be specified among multiple tables, leading to an n-way join. For
example, consider the following three-way join:

((PROJECT ™ pnum=DnumberO EPARTMENT) >< Mgr_ssn=SsnEMPLOYEE)
