Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts

discussed in this chapter. Srikant and Agrawal (1995) proposes mining generalized
rules. Savasere et al. (1998) present the first approach to mining negative associa-
tions. Agrawal et al. (1996) describe the Quest system at IBM. Sarawagi et al. (1998)
describe an implementation where association rules are integrated with a relational
database management system. Piatesky-Shapiro and Frawley (1992) have contrib-
uted papers from a wide range of topics related to knowledge discovery. Zhang et al.
(1996) present the BIRCH algorithm for clustering large databases. Information
about decision tree learning and the classification algorithm presented in this chap-
ter can be found in Mitchell (1997).

Adriaans and Zantinge (1996), Fayyad et al. (1997), and Weiss and Indurkhya (1998)
are books devoted to the different aspects of data mining and its use in prediction.
The idea of genetic algorithms was proposed by Holland (1975); a good survey of
genetic algorithms appears in Srinivas and Patnaik (1994). Neural networks have a
vast literature; a comprehensive introduction is available in Lippman (1987).

Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar (2006) provides a comprehensive introduction to data
mining and has a detailed set of references. Readers are also advised to consult pro-
ceedings of two prominent annual conferences in data mining: the Knowledge
Discovery and Data Mining Conference (KDD), which has been running since 1995,
and the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM), which has been run-
ning since 2001. Links to past conferences may be found at http://dblp.uni-trier.de.
