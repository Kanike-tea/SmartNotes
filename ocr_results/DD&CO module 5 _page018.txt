o Different segments may take different times to operate on the incominginformation.

o Some segments are skipped for certain operations.
o Two or more segments may require memory access at the same time, causing one
segment to wait until another is finished with the memory.

Example: four-segment instruction pipeline:

* Assume that:
o The decoding of the instruction can be combined with the calculation of the effective
address into one segment.
o The instruction execution and storing of the result can be combined into onesegment.
« Fig 9-7 shows how the instruction cycle in the CPU can be processed with a four- segment
pipeline.
o Thus up to four suboperations in the instruction cycle can overlap and up tofour different
instructions can be in progress of being processed at the sametime.

e  Aninstruction in the sequence may be causes a branch out of normal sequence.
o» In that case the pending operations in the last two segments are completedand all
information stored in the instruction buffer is deleted.

o Similarly, an interrupt request will cause the pipeline to empty and start againfrom a new
address value.
