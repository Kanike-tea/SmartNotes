or classes), and relationships. The internal nodes represent individual objects or
composite attributes. The leaf nodes represent actual data values of simple
(atomic) attributes.

There are two main differences between the semistructured model and the object
model that we discussed in Chapter 12:

1. The schema information—names of attributes, relationships, and classes
(object types) in the semistructured model—is intermixed with the objects
and their data values in the same data structure.

2. In the semistructured model, there is no requirement for a predefined
schema to which the data objects must conform, although it is possible
to define a schema if necessary. The object model of Chapter 12 requires
a schema.

In addition to structured and semistructured data, a third category exists, known as
unstructured data because there is very limited indication of the type of data. A
typical example is a text document that contains information embedded within it.
Web pages in HTML that contain some data are considered to be unstructured
data. Consider part of an HTML file, shown in Figure 13.2. Text that appears
between angled brackets, <...>, isan HTML tag. A tag with a slash, </...>, indicates
an end tag, which represents the ending of the effect of a matching start tag. The
tags mark up the document! in order to instruct an HTML processor how to dis-
play the text between a start tag and a matching end tag. Hence, the tags specify
document formatting rather than the meaning of the various data elements in the
document. HTML tags specify information, such as font size and style (boldface,
italics, and so on), color, heading levels in documents, and so on. Some tags provide
text structuring in documents, such as specifying a numbered or unnumbered list
ora table. Even these structuring tags specify that the embedded textual data is to be
displayed in a certain manner rather than indicating the type of data represented in
the table.

HTML uses a large number of predefined tags, which are used to specify a variety of
commands for formatting Web documents for display. The start and end tags spec-
ify the range of text to be formatted by each command. A few examples of the tags
shown in Figure 13.2 follow:

= The <HTML> ... </HTML> tags specify the boundaries of the document.

= The document header information—within the <HEAD> ... </HEAD>
tags—specifies various commands that will be used elsewhere in the docu-
ment. For example, it may specify various script functions in a language
such as JavaScript or PERL, or certain formatting styles (fonts, paragraph
styles, header styles, and so on) that can be used in the document. It can also
specify a title to indicate what the HTML file is for, and other similar infor-
mation that will not be displayed as part of the document.

'That is why it is known as HyperText Markup Language.
