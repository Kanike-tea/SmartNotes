Chapter 19 Query Optimization

American National Standards Institute). The computation clause not only allows
for ease of application development but also offers the Oracle RDBMS an opportu-
nity to perform better optimization.

19.9.5 Hints

An interesting addition to the Oracle query optimizer is the capability for an applica-
tion developer to specify hints (also called query annotations or directives in other
systems) to the optimizer. Hints are embedded in the text of an SQL statement. Hints
are commonly used to address the infrequent cases where the optimizer chooses a
suboptimal plan. The idea is that an application developer occasionally might need
to override the optimizer decisions based on cost or cardinality mis-estimations. For
example, consider the EMPLOYEE table shown in Figure 5.6. The Sex column of that
table has only two distinct values. If there are 10,000 employees, then the optimizer,
in the absence of a histogram on the Sex column, would estimate that half are male
and half are female, assuming a uniform data distribution. If a secondary index
exists, it would more than likely not be used. However, if the application developer
knows that there are only 100 male employees, a hint could be specified in an SQL
query whose WHERE-clause condition is Sex=“M’ so that the associated index would
be used in processing the query. Various types of hints can be specified for different
operations; these hints include but are not limited to the following:

The access path for a given table
The join order for a query block

.
.
= A particular join method for a join between tables
.

The enabling or disabling of a transformation

19.9.6 Outlines

In Oracle RDBMSs, outlines are used to preserve execution plans of SQL state-
ments or queries. Outlines are implemented and expressed as a collection of
hints, because hints are easily portable and comprehensible. Oracle provides an
extensive set of hints that are powerful enough to specify any execution plan, no
matter how complex. When an outline is used during the optimization of an SQL
statement, these hints are applied at appropriate stages by the optimizer (and
other components). Every SQL statement processed by the Oracle optimizer
automatically generates an outline that can be displayed with the execution plan.
Outlines are used for purposes such as plan stability, what-if analysis, and perfor-
mance experiments.

19.9.7 SQL Plan Management

Execution plans for SQL statements have a significant impact on the overall perfor-
mance of a database system. New optimizer statistics, configuration parameter
changes, software updates, introduction of new query optimization and processing
techniques, and hardware resource utilizations are among a multitude of factors
