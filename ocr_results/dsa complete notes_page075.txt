Analysis of Polynomial function
The number of non zero terms in A and in B are the most important factors in the time complexity

Therefore, let m and n be the number of nonzero terms in A and B, respectively.
A(x)= am-1xm-1 + a0x0
B(x)= bm-1xn-1 + bOx0

If m > 0 and n > 0, the while loop is entered. Each iteration of the loop requires O(1) time.At each
iteration, either a or b moves to the next term or both move to the next term. Since the iteration
terminates when either a or b reaches the end of the list, therefore, the number of iterations is bounded
bym+n- 1.

The time for the remaining two loops is bounded by O(n +m). The first loop can iterate m times and
the second can iterate n times. So, the asymptotic computing time of this algorithm is O(n +m).

Erasing a circular list

If we wish to compute more polynomials, it would be useful to reclaim the NODEs that are being
used. This function erases a circular list pointed by ptr and adds the NODE to the availability list.
void cerase(POLY *ptr)

{
POLY* temp;
if (ptr )
{
temp = ptr>link ptr-
>link=avail avail =
temp;
*ptr = NULL;
