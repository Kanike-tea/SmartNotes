> Let us consider the one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the two graphs under _
which the vertices A, B, C, D, P, Q, R, S of the first graph correspond to the vertices A’, B’,C’,
D’, P’, O', R’, S’ respectively of the second graph, and vice-versa. In this correspondence, the
edges determined by the corresponding vertices correspond so that the adjacency of vertices is
retained. As such, the two graphs are isomorphic. |
We note that the first graph is the hypercube Q3; see Figure 1.40. The second graph is just
another drawing of Q3. |

Show that the following two graphs are isomorphic:
