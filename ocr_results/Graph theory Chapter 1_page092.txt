1.10. Hamilton cycles and Hamilton paths 95
1 Se TFET

We observe that three edges are incident at every vertex of the graph. Of these three edges
only two can be included in a Hamilton cycle (if it exists). Thus, at each of the 10 vertices of
the graph one edge has to be excluded. By actual counting, we find that the number of edges
to be excluded is six. (For example, the edges AL, BM, CN, DE, PM, QE). Consequently, the
number of edges that remian in the graph is 15 — 6 = 9. These edges are insufficient to form a
Hamilton cycle in the graph.

Thus, the Peterson graph does not contain a Hamilton cycle in it.

By examining Figure 1.131, we note that the edges AB, BC, CD, DE, EQ, QM, MP, PL,
LN form a path and this path includes all the vertices. This path is therefore a Hamilton path.
Thus, the Peterson graph does have a Hamilton path in it. =

> By examining the given graph, we notice that in the graph there is a cycle AELSMNPQR-
CDFBA which contains all the vertices of the graph. This cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle. Since
the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle in it, the graph is a Hamiltonian graph. 5
