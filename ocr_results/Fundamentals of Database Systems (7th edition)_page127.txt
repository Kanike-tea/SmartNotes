b. During a particular semester and year, an instructor can teach only one
section at a particular DaysTime value.

c. During a particular semester and year, the section numbers for sections
offered for the same course must all be different.

Can you think of any other similar constraints?

Composite and multivalued attributes can be nested to any number of lev-
els. Suppose we want to design an attribute for a STUDENT entity type to
keep track of previous college education. Such an attribute will have one
entry for each college previously attended, and each such entry will be com-
posed of college name, start and end dates, degree entries (degrees awarded
at that college, if any), and transcript entries (courses completed at that col-
lege, if any). Each degree entry contains the degree name and the month and
year the degree was awarded, and each transcript entry contains a course
name, semester, year, and grade. Design an attribute to hold this informa-
tion. Use the conventions in Figure 3.5.

Show an alternative design for the attribute described in Exercise 3.17 that
uses only entity types (including weak entity types, if needed) and relation-
ship types.

Consider the ER diagram in Figure 3.21, which shows a simplified schema
for an airline reservations system. Extract from the ER diagram the require-
ments and constraints that produced this schema. Try to be as precise as
possible in your requirements and constraints specification.

In Chapters 1 and 2, we discussed the database environment and database
users. We can consider many entity types to describe such an environment,
such as DBMS, stored database, DBA, and catalog/data dictionary. Try to
specify all the entity types that can fully describe a database system and its
environment; then specify the relationship types among them, and draw an
ER diagram to describe such a general database environment.

- Design an ER schema for keeping track of information about votes taken in

the U.S. House of Representatives during the current two-year congress-
ional session. The database needs to keep track of each U.S. STATE’s Name
(e.g., ‘Texas’, ‘New York’, ‘California’) and include the Region of the state
(whose domain is {‘Northeast’, ‘Midwest’, ‘Southeast’, ‘Southwest’, ‘West’}).
Each CONGRESS_PERSON in the House of Representatives is described by
his or her Name, plus the District represented, the Start_date when the con-
gressperson was first elected, and the political Party to which he or she
belongs (whose domain is {‘Republican’, ‘Democrat’, ‘Independent’,
“Other’}). The database keeps track of each BILL (i.e., proposed law),
including the Bill_name, the Date_of_vote on the bill, whether the bill
Passed_or_failed (whose domain is {‘Yes’, ‘No’}), and the Sponsor (the
congressperson(s) who sponsored—that is, proposed—the bill). The data-
base also keeps track of how each congressperson voted on each bill (domain
