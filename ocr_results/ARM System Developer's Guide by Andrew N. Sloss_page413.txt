11.3 SUMMARY

The fundamental components that make up an embedded operating system executing on

al

n ARM processor are the following:

The initialization sets up all of the internal variables, data structures, and hardware
devices used by the operating system.

Memory handling organizes the memory to accommodate the kernel plus the various
applications to be executed.

All interrupts and exceptions require a handler. For unused interrupts and exceptions,
a dummy handler must be installed.

A periodic timer is required for preemptive operating systems. The timer produces an
interrupt that causes the scheduler to be called.

A scheduler is an algorithm that determines the new task to be executed.

A context switch saves the state of the current task and loads the state of the next
task.

These components are exemplified in the operating system called the Simple Little

Operating System (SLOS):

Initialization—The initialization sets up all the functions of SLOS, including the bank
mode stacks, process control blocks (PCB) for each application, device drivers, and
so on.
