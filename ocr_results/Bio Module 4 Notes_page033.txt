Denticles on shark skin are like tiny bumps or ridges. They disrupt the flow of water
around the shark's body, making it smoother and reducing turbulence. This disruption
reduces the resistance the shark experiences as it swim, allowing it to move faster and
with less effort.

Turbulence in Water

Turbulence is when a fluid, like water or air, becomes chaotic and unpredictable.
Insteadof flowing smoothly, it swirls and forms irregular patterns. This turbulence creates
resistance or drag, which makes it harder for things to move through the fluid. In
swimming, reducing turbulence is important because it helps to minimize resistance,
allowing swimmers to move more easily and efficiently through the water.

Reducing Drag

When a shark swims through the water, the water normally flows smoothly over its body.
However, the denticles on the shark's skin disrupt this smooth flow. They create small
disturbances in the water, which helps to break up turbulent currents that can slow the
shark down. By reducing turbulence, the denticles make the flow of water around the
shark's body smoother. This smoother flow reduces the resistance or drags the shark
experiences as it moves through the water, allowing it to swim more efficiently.

Frictionless Swim Suits

Shark skin has inspired the development of friction-reducing swim suits, which are
designed to improve the performance of swimmers by reducing drag in the water.

Friction-reducing swim suits use a similar structure to that of shark skin to reduce drag
and improve swimmer performance. These suits are made from high-tech materials
that mimicthe properties of shark skin, such as the shape and size of the denticles.

Materials Used
The materials used to create friction-reducing swim suits inspired by shark skin include:

e Polyurethane: A type of polymer that is commonly used in the production of swim suits, as
it is durable and can be molded into a variety of shapes.

e  Lycra/Spandex: Lycra and spandex are made from the same synthetic fiber, which is
technically called elastane. Elastane fibers are typically composed of a polymer called
polyurethane which is then blended with other fibers like nylon, polyester, or cotton) that is
known for its stretch and flexibility.

e High-tech fabrics: A range of high-tech fabrics have been developed specifically for use in
swim suits. These fabrics are designed to be lightweight, water-repellent, and hydrodynamic,
and often incorporate materials such as silicone or Teflon to reduce drag.

Examples

e Speedo Fastskin: This swim suit was designed based on the structure of shark skin and is
made from a high-tech fabric that incorporates a range of materials to reduce drag and
turbulence in the water.
