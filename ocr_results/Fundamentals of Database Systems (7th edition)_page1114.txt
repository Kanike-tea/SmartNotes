1084 Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts

A strong positive association has been shown between soft drinks and chips. If we
find a large support for the fact that when customers buy Days chips they predomi-
nantly buy Topsy and not Joke and not Wakeup, that would be interesting because
we would normally expect that if there is a strong association between Days and
Topsy, there should also be such a strong association between Days and Joke or
Days and Wakeup.?

In the frozen yogurt and bottled water groupings shown in Figure 28.3, suppose
the Reduce versus Healthy-brand division is 80-20 and the Plain and Clear
brands division is 60-40 among respective categories. This would give a joint
probability of Reduce frozen yogurt being purchased with Plain bottled water as
48% among the transactions containing a frozen yogurt and bottled water. If this
support, however, is found to be only 20%, it would indicate a significant nega-
tive association among Reduce yogurt and Plain bottled water; again, that would
be interesting.

The problem of finding negative association is important in the above situations
given the domain knowledge in the form of item generalization hierarchies (that is,
the beverage given and desserts hierarchies shown in Figure 28.3), the existing pos-
itive associations (such as between the frozen yogurt and bottled water groups), and
the distribution of items (such as the name brands within related groups). The
scope of discovery of negative associations is limited in terms of knowing the item
hierarchies and distributions. Exponential growth of negative associations remains
a challenge.

28.2.7 Additional Considerations for Association Rules

The mining of association rules in real-life databases is complicated by the following
factors:

= The cardinality of itemsets in most situations is extremely large, and the vol-
ume of transactions is very high as well. Some operational databases in
retailing and communication industries collect tens of millions of transac-
tions per day.

= Transactions show variability in such factors as geographic location and sea-
sons, making sampling difficult.

= Item classifications exist along multiple dimensions. Hence, driving the dis-
covery process with domain knowledge, particularly for negative rules, is
extremely difficult.

= Quality of data is variable; significant problems exist with missing, errone-
ous, conflicting, as well as redundant data in many industries.

5For simplicity we are assuming a uniform distribution of transactions among members of a hierarchy.
