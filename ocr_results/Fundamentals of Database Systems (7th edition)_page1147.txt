Review Questions

Administration of a data warehouse will require far broader skills than are needed for
traditional database administration. Often, different parts of a large organization view
the data differently. A team of highly skilled technical experts with overlapping areas of
expertise will likely be needed, rather than a single individual. The team must also pos-
sess a thorough knowledge of the business and specifically the rules and regulations, the
constraints and the policies of the enterprise. Like database administration, data ware-
house administration is only partly technical; a large part of the responsibility requires
working effectively with all the members of the organization who have an interest in the
data warehouse. However difficult that can be at times for database administrators, it is
that much more challenging for data warehouse administrators because the scope of
their responsibilities is considerably broader than that faced by database administrators.

Design of the management function and selection of the management team for a
database warehouse are crucial. Managing the data warehouse in a large organiza-
tion will surely be a major task. Many commercial tools are available to support
management functions. Effective data warehouse management will be a team func-
tion that requires a wide set of technical skills, careful coordination, and effective
leadership. Just as we must prepare for the evolution of the warehouse, we must also
recognize that the skills of the management team will, of necessity, evolve with it.

29.8 Summary

In this chapter, we surveyed the field known as data warehousing. Data warehousing
can be seen as a process that requires a variety of activities to precede it. In contrast,
data mining (see Chapter 28) may be thought of as an activity that draws knowledge
from an existing data warehouse or other sources of data. We first introduced in Sec-
tion 29.1 key concepts related to a data warehouse and defined terms such as OLAP
and DSS and contrasted them with OLTP. We presented a general architecture of
data warehousing systems. We discussed in Section 29.2 the fundamental characteris-
tics of data warehouses and their different types. We then discussed in Section 29.3
the modeling of data in warehouses using what is popularly known as the multidi-
mensional data model. Different types of tables and schemas were discussed. We gave
an elaborate account of the processes and design considerations involved in building
a data warehouse in Section 29.4. We then presented the typical special functionality
associated with a data warehouse in Section 29.5. The view concept from the rela-
tional model was contrasted with the multidimensional view of data in data ware-
houses in Section 29.6. We finally discussed in Section 29.7 the difficulties of
implementing data warehouses and the challenges of data warehouse administration.

Review Questions
29.1. What is a data warehouse? How does it differ from a database?

29.2. Define the following terms: OLAP (online analytical processing), ROLAP
(relational OLAP), MOLAP (multidimensional OLAP), and DSS (decision-
support systems).
