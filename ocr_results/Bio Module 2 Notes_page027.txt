e Laccases are copper-containing oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of lignin, a
complex polymer found in plant cell walls, as well as other compounds such as phenols
and aryl alcohols.

e Peroxidases are enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide to oxidize organic compounds.

e Manganese peroxidases are enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide to oxidize lignin and
other compounds.

The lignolytic enzymes used in bio-bleaching are typically produced by fungi or bacteria, and
are immobilized on a support, such as a ceramic bead or a cellulosic matrix, to ensure stability
and prolonged activity. The immobilized enzymes are then added to the fibers, where they

catalyze the oxidation of colored impurities, resulting in a brighter and more uniform color.

Enzymes in Food Processing

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in food processing,
improving texture, flavor, and shelf life. They are widely used in industries like dairy, baking,

rewing, and meat processing to enhance efficiency and product quality.

1. Major Types of Enzymes Used in Food Processing
A. Carbohydrases (Break Down Carbohydrates)

[Enzyme |/Function [Applications

\Amylase |[Breaks starch into sugars Baking, brewing, syrup production
