SPARSE MATRIX REPRESENTATION

* We can classify uniquely any element within a matrix by using the triple . Therefore, we

can use an array of triples to represent a sparse matrix.

+ Sparse matrix contains many zero entries.

+ When a sparse matrix is represented as a 2-dimensional array, we waste space For ex, if

100* 100 matrix contains only 100 entries then we waste 9900 out of 10000 memory spaces.

+ Solution: Store only the non-zero elements.

Structure Sparse Matrix is

objects: a set of triples, <row, column, value>, where row and column are
integers and form a unique combifiatilon, andvalue comes from the set
item.

functions:

for all a,

= x € item, d, j, max_col, max_row € index
Sparse_Marix Create (max_

, max _01)

return a Sparse matrix that can hold up to max_items = max
_row *max{ cob and whoSe maximum row size is max_row and
whose maximum jcolumn’ size is max_col.

Sparse_Matrix(Pranspose(a) ::=

return the matrix produced by interchanging the row and
column value of every triple.

Sparse |MatPix Add(a, b) ::=
if the dimensions of a and b are the same

xeturn the matrix produced by adding corresponding items,
namely those with identical row and col values.

else
return error
Sparse Matrix Multiply(a, b) ::=
if number of columns in a equals number of rows in b
xeturn the matrix d produced by multiplying a by b according

to the formula:d [i] [j]=U(ali] [k] -b[k][j]) where d (i, j)
is the (i,j)th element

else
return error.
