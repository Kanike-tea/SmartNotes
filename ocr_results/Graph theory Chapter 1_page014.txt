[ A complete bipartite graph G = (V;, V2; E) in which the bipartites V; and V2 contain r and
5 vertices respectively, with r < s, is denoted by K;,s. In this graph, each of r vertices in V; is

joined to each of s vertices in V7, Thus, K;,, has r + s vertices and rs edges; that is K,,s is of
order r + s and of size rs; it is therefore a (r + 5, rs) graph,

Figures 1.21(a) to 1.21(d) depict some complete bipartite graphs. Observe that in Figure
1.21 (a), the bipartites are V, = {A} and V. = (P,Q, R}; the vertex A is joined to each of
‘the vertices P, Q, R by an edge. In Figure 1, 21(b), the bipartites are V; = {A} and Vz =
(M,N, P,Q, R}; the vertex A is joined to each of the vertices M,N, P,Q, R by an oa

in Figure 1.21(c), the bipartites are V, = {A, B} and V2 = {P, Q, R}; each of the vertices A
and Bis joined to each of the vertices P, Q, R by an edge. In Figure 1.21(d), the bipartites are
V, = {A,B,C} and V2 = {P, Q, R); each of the vertices A, B, C is joined to each of the vertices
P,O,R.

Of these complete bipartite graphs, the graph K3,3 shown in Figure 1.21(d) is of great
importance. This is known as the Kuratowski’s second graph.

It is to be noted that a bipartite graph G is not a complete graph even if G is a complete
bipartite graph. Because, in such a graph, there exists no edge between two vertices if they
_ belong to the same bipartite.

Draw a diagram of the graph G = (V,E) in each of the following cases:
(i) V={A,B,C,D},  E ={AB,AC,AD, CD}

(i) V = (vy,¥2, 03, v4, 5}, E= Magee v2v3, v4vs}

ii) V = (P,0,R,8,T), E={PS,OR,QS)

(iY) V = (v1, v2, 3, v4, V5, Veh E = {V1¥4, V1¥6, V4V6, V3V2, V3V5, V2V5}
