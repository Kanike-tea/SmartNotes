Now, among the vertices C, v1, D, E,F, two vertices which carry the smallest weights are
Candy, Add their weights (8 and 9)'to get'a new weight 17. Assign this weight to a new
‘ertex vy and draw a tree having v2 as the root and C and y, as its children, Rearrange the
Yertices present at this stage (namely v2, Dy’E, F) in the non-decreasing order of their weights.
The resulting graph is shown below, '
