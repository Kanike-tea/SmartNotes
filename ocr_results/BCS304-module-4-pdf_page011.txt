4.5 Counting Binary trees
4.5.1: Distinct Binary tree

if n= 0 orn = 1, there is only one binary tree. If n = 2, then there are two distinct trees and if n

= 3.

4.5.2 Stack permutations:

Suppose we have the preorder sequence: ABCDEFGHI and the inorder sequence:

BCAEDGHFI of the binary tree. To construct the binary tree from these sequences, we
look at the first letter in the preorder sequence, A. This letter must be the root of the tree by
definition of the preorder traversal (VLR. }. We also know by definition of the inorder
traversal {LVR} that all nodes preceding A in the inorder sequence (B Q are in the left
subtree, while the remaining nodes {ED GHFI) are in the right subtree. Figure 5.49(a) is

imation to the correct tree. Moving right in the preorder sequence, we find

our first approx
B has an empty left

B as the next root. Since no node precedes B in the inorder sequence,
which means that C is in its right subtree. Figure 5.49(b) is the nex
we arrive at the binary tree of Figure 5.49(c). By formalizing this
we can verify that every binary tree has a

subtree, t approximation.

Continuing in this way,
