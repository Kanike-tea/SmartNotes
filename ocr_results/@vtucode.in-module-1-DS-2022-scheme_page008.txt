RECURSIVE ALGORITHMS

+ A function calls itself either directly or indirectly during execution.

+ Recursive-algorithms when compared to iterative-algorithms are normally compact and
easy to understand.

¢ Various types of recursion:

1) Direct recursion: where a recursive-function invokes itself.
2) Indirect recursion: A function which contains a call to another function which in

turn calls another function and so on and eventually calls the first function.

void f1() void £2() void £3()
{ { {

£2()7 £3(); £1);
} } }

For example:
1. FACTORIAL

“The product of the positive integers from 1 to n, is called "n factorial" and is denoted by
nl? n! =1*2 * 3. (n-2)*(n - 1)*n
It is also convenient to define 0! =1, so that the function is defined for all nonnegative
integers.
Definition: (Factorial Function)
a) If n=0,then n! =1.
b) If n>0, then n! = n*(n +1)!

Observe that this definition of n! is recursive, since it refers to itself when it uses (n - 1)!
(a) The value of nhis explicitly given when n=0 (thus 0 is the base value)

(b) The value of n! for arbitrary nis defined in terms of a smaller value of n which is
closer to the base value 0.

The following are two procedures that each calculate n factorial .

Using for loop: This procedure evaluates N! using an iterative loop process
Procedure: FACTORIAL (FACT, N)

This procedure calculates N! and returns the value in the variable FACT.

If N =0, then: Set FACT: = 1, and Return.

Set FACT: = 1. [Initializes FACT for loop.]

Repeat for K = 1 to N.
