concept of triggers and the CREATE TRIGGER statement. Then, in Section 7.3, we
described the SQL facility for defining views on the database. Views are also called
virtual or derived tables because they present the user with what appear to be tables;
however, the information in those tables is derived from previously defined tables.
Section 7.4 introduced the SQL ALTER TABLE statement, which is used for modify-
ing the database tables and constraints.

Table 7.2 summarizes the syntax (or structure) of various SQL statements. This
summary is not meant to be comprehensive or to describe every possible SQL
construct; rather, it is meant to serve as a quick reference to the major types of
constructs available in SQL. We use BNF notation, where nonterminal symbols
