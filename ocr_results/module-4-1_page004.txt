BINARY TREES
Definition: A binary tree T is defined as a finite set of nodes such that,
e Tis empty or
e T consists of a root and two disjoint binary trees called the left subtree and the right

subtree.

Different kinds of Binary Tree

1. Skewed Tree
A skewed tree is a tree, skewed to the left or skews to the right.
or
It is a tree consisting of only left subtree or only right subtree.
e A tree with only left subtrees is called Left Skewed Binary Tree.
e A tree with only right subtrees is called Right Skewed Binary Tree.

2.Complete Binary Tree

A binary tree T is said to complete if all its levels, except possibly the last level, have the
maximum number node 2, i > 0 and if all the nodes at the last level appears as far left as
possible.
