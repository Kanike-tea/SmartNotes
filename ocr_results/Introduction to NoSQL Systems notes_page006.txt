5. Use Cases of MongoDB and Document Databases

Content Management Systems (CMS): Store articles, media, and user-generated
content with flexible fields.

E-commerce: Manage product catalogs with varying attributes like size, color, price,
and reviews.

loT and Real-Time Analytics: Handle time-series data from sensors and devices in a
scalable manner.

Mobile and Web Apps: Store user sessions, activity logs, and preferences without
rigid schema enforcement.

Customer Data Platforms: Manage user profiles with changing fields like purchase
history, preferences, and feedback.

6. Limitations of Document-Based Databases

While document databases are powerful and flexible, they are not suited for every use

case:

No Join Support: Joins are not natively supported like in relational databases.
Workarounds include embedding documents or manual aggregation.

Large Document Size: Storing too much data in a single document can cause
performance issues. MongoDB limits document size to 16MB.

Not Ideal for Complex Transactions: Although MongoDB has added multi-document
ACID transactions, relational databases still perform better in transaction-heavy
environments.

7. Conclusion

Document-based NoSQL systems, especially MongoDB, offer a flexible, scalable, and
developer-friendly alternative to relational databases. They are well-suited for modern

applications that handle diverse and evolving data structures. By storing all related data in

single, self-contained documents, these databases simplify application logic and improve

performance for many real-world workloads. With strong community support and

enterprise features, MongoDB has become the go-to choice for many organizations

building cloud-native, real-time, and scalable applications.
