Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

In most instances, spatial items are a discrete version of continuous variables. For
example, in the United States income regions may be defined as regions where the
mean yearly income is within certain ranges, such as, below $40,000, from $40,000
to $100,000, and above $100,000.

= Spatial clustering attempts to group database objects so that the most similar
objects are in the same cluster, and objects in different clusters are as dissimi-
lar as possible. One application of spatial clustering is to group together seis-
mic events in order to determine earthquake faults. An example of a spatial
clustering algorithm is density-based clustering, which tries to find clusters
based on the density of data points in a region. These algorithms treat clus-
ters as dense regions of objects in the data space. Two variations of these
algorithms are density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise
(DBSCAN)?® and density-based clustering (DENCLUE).”? DBSCAN is a
density-based clustering algorithm because it finds a number of clusters
starting from the estimated density distribution of corresponding nodes.

26.3.6 Applications of Spatial Data

Spatial data management is useful in many disciplines, including geography, remote
sensing, urban planning, and natural resource management. Spatial database man-
agement is playing an important role in the solution of challenging scientific prob-
lems such as global climate change and genomics. Due to the spatial nature of
genome data, GIS and spatial database management systems have a large role to
play in the area of bioinformatics. Some of the typical applications include pattern
recognition (for example, to check if the topology of a particular gene in the genome
is found in any other sequence feature map in the database), genome browser devel-
opment, and visualization maps. Another important application area of spatial data
mining is the spatial outlier detection. A spatial outlier is a spatially referenced
object whose nonspatial attribute values are significantly different from those of
other spatially referenced objects in its spatial neighborhood. For example, if a
neighborhood of older houses has just one brand-new house, that house would be
an outlier based on the nonspatial attribute ‘house_age’. Detecting spatial outliers is
useful in many applications of geographic information systems and spatial data-
bases. These application domains include transportation, ecology, public safety,
public health, climatology, and location-based services.

26.4 Multimedia Database Concepts

Multimedia databases provide features that allow users to store and query differ-
ent types of multimedia information, which includes images (such as photos or
drawings), video clips (such as movies, newsreels, or home videos), audio clips

28D SCAN was proposed by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jérg Sander, and Xiaowei Xu (1996).
?°DENCLUE was proposed by Hinnenberg and Gabriel (2007).
