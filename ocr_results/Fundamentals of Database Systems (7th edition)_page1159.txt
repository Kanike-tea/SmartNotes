30.2 Discretionary Access Control Based on Granting and Revoking Privileges

about information collection, told in advance what will be done with their informa-
tion, and given a reasonable opportunity to approve or disapprove of such use of the
information. A related concept, trust, relates to both security and privacy and is seen
as increasing when it is perceived that both security and privacy are provided for.

30.2 Discretionary Access Control Based
on Granting and Revoking Privileges

The typical method of enforcing discretionary access control in a database system
is based on the granting and revoking of privileges. Let us consider privileges in the
context of a relational DBMS. In particular, we will discuss a system of privileges
somewhat similar to the one originally developed for the SQL language (see Chap-
ters 7 and 8). Many current relational DBMSs use some variation of this technique.
The main idea is to include statements in the query language that allow the DBA
and selected users to grant and revoke privileges.

30.2.1 Types of Discretionary Privileges

In SQL2 and later versions,’ the concept of an authorization identifier is used to
refer, roughly speaking, to a user account (or group of user accounts). For simplic-
ity, we will use the words user or account interchangeably in place of authorization
identifier. The DBMS must provide selective access to each relation in the database
based on specific accounts. Operations may also be controlled; thus, having an
account does not necessarily entitle the account holder to all the functionality pro-
vided by the DBMS. Informally, there are two levels for assigning privileges to use
the database system:

= The account level. At this level, the DBA specifies the particular privileges
that each account holds independently of the relations in the database.

= The relation (or table) level. At this level, the DBA can control the privilege
to access each individual relation or view in the database.

The privileges at the account level apply to the capabilities provided to the account
itself and can include the CREATE SCHEMA or CREATE TABLE privilege, to create a
schema or base relation; the CREATE VIEW privilege; the ALTER privilege, to apply
schema changes such as adding or removing attributes from relations; the DROP
privilege, to delete relations or views; the MODIFY privilege, to insert, delete, or
update tuples; and the SELECT privilege, to retrieve information from the database
by using a SELECT query. Notice that these account privileges apply to the account
in general. If a certain account does not have the CREATE TABLE privilege, no rela-
tions can be created from that account. Account-level privileges are not defined as
part of SQL2; they are left to the DBMS implementers to define. In earlier versions
of SQL, a CREATETAB privilege existed to give an account the privilege to create
tables (relations).
