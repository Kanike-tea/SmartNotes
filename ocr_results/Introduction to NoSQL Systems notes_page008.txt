4. Use Cases of Key-Value Stores

Key-value databases are used in a wide range of applications where speed and simplicity
are essential:

« Caching: Store frequently accessed data (e.g., Redis used to cache web pages or
user sessions).

« Session Management: Store user sessions for websites and applications.

« User Preferences and Profiles: Quickly retrieve and update settings for individual

users.
« Real-Time Data: Store live analytics data, leaderboard scores, or sensor readings.

« Shopping Cart Data: Temporary storage of e-commerce cart items for quick
retrieval and updates.

Example:
plaintext
CopyEdit
Key: user123

Value: {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "age": 30}

To retrieve this data: GET user123

5. Advantages of Key-Value Stores

« High Performance: Optimized for speed with constant time complexity for
read/write operations.

« Simplicity: Minimal overhead; easy to implement and use.
e Scalability: Designed for horizontal scaling in distributed environments.

e Flexibility: Can store any type of value; does not require a rigid schema.

6. Limitations of Key-Value Stores
Despite their speed and simplicity, key-value databases are not suitable for every scenario:

e Lack of Structure: There is no querying based on values; data must be retrieved by
key only.
