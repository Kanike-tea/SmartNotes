+ The memory is implemented using the dynamic components (SIMM, DIMM).

The access time for main-memory is about 10 times longer than the
access time for Ll cache.

Cache Memory

It is the fast access memory located in between processor and main memory

as shown inthe fig. It is designed to reduce the access time.

The cache memory holds the copy of recently accessed data and instructions.
e The processor needs less access time to read the data and instructions from

the cache memory as compared to main memory .
e Hence by incorporating cache memory, in between processor and main
memory, itis possible to enhance the performance of the system.
* The effectiveness of cache mechanism is based on the property of

“Locality of Reference”.

Locality of Reference

* Many instructions in the localized areas of program are executed repeatedly during
sometime of execution

+ Remainder of the program is accessed relatively infrequently

+ There are 2 types of locality reference:
1) Temporal

> The recently executed instructions are likely to be executed again and again.

> Eg -instruction in loops, nested loops and few function calls.
2) Spatial
> Instructions in close proximity to recently executed instruction are likely to be
executed soon. (near by instructions)
- If active segment of program is placed in cache-memory, then total execution time
can be reduced.
+ Cache Block / cache line refers to the set of contiguous address locations of some

size.

+ The Cache-memory stores a reasonable number of blocks at a given time.
