65. Two boys’ B, , By and two girls G, ' G, are throwing ball from one.to the other. Each
~ boy throws the ball to the other boy with probability 1/2 and to each girl with probability °
1/4. On the otherhand each girl throws the ball to each boy with probability 1/2 and
never to the other girl. In the lon 1g run how often does each receive the ball.

We need to find the fixed probab

ility vector v= (a,b,c, d)
such that uP =v _ :

"+ «+ Refering to Problem -53, Wehave v = (1/3, 1/3, V6, 1/6)

Thus we can say that in-the long run each boy receives the ball 1/3 of the time
and each girl 1/6 of the time.
