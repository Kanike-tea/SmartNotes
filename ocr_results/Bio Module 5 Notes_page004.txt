The Process

Harvesting muscle tissue: A small sample of muscle tissue is taken, typically from a
donor or an animal model.

Cell removal: The living cells within the muscle tissue are removed using a process
called decellularization. This involves treating the tissue with specific chemical solution or
enzymes that break down and wash away the cellular components, while preserving the
ECM.

ECM scaffold: The remaining ECM, which forms the structure of the muscle, is now a
scaffold. It consists of proteins, such as collagen and elastin, and other molecules that
provide support and signals for tissue growth.

Seeding cells: The decellularized muscle scaffold is then seeded with desired cells. These
can be stem cells or specialized cells relevant to the type of tissue being regenerated. The
cells are introduced onto the scaffold, allowing them to attach and populate the structure.
Tissue growth: Over time, the seeded cells proliferate and differentiate, meaning they
multiply and transform into specific cell types required for the desired tissue. The ECM
scaffold guides the cells' growth, providing physical support, and biochemical cues to
influence their behavior.

Tissue integration: As the cells continue to grow, they populate the scaffold and form
new tissue. The new tissue integrates with the surrounding native tissue, gradually
replacing the decellularized scaffold with functional, regenerated tissue.

By utilizing the decellularized muscle scaffold, the process of tissue generation takes

advantage of the existing three-dimensional architecture and mechanical properties of the
muscle. This approach has the potential to address challenges in tissue engineering, such as
creating a suitable environment for cell growth, promoting vascularization, and facilitating
functional integration of regenerated tissues.
