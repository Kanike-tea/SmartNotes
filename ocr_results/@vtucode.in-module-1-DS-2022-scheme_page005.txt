DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

+ If we frequently allocate the memory space, then it is better to define a macro as shown

below:

#define MALLOC (p,s)
if(! ((p)==malloc(s)))
} printf ("insufficient memory");

exit (0);

¢ Now memory can be initialized using following:

MALLOC (pi, sizeof (int));
MALLOC (pf, sizeof (float) )

DANGLING REFERENCE

+ Whenever all pointers to a dynamically allocated area of storage are lost, the storage is lost
to the program. This is called a dangling reference.

POINTERS CAN BE DANGEROUS

1) Set all pointers to NULL when they are not actually pointing to an object. This makes
sure that you will not attempt to access an area of memory that is either
— out of range of your program or
— that does not contain a pointer reference to a legitimate object
2) Use explicit type casts when converting between pointer types.
pi=malloc(sizeof(int)); //assign to pi a pointer to int
pf=(float*)pi; //casts an ‘int’ pointer to a ‘float’ pointer
3) Pointers have same size as data type 'int'. Since int is the default type specifier, some
programmers omit return type when defining a function. The return type defaults to
‘int’ which can later be interpreted as a pointer. Therefore, programmer has to define

explicit return types for functions.

void swap(int *p,int *q) //both parameters are pointers to ints

{
int temp=*p; //declares temp as an int and assigns to it the contents
of what p points to

*p=*q; //stores what q points to into the location where p
points
*q=temp;

//places the contents temp in location pointed to by q
