Fig 3: Logical and physical caches

The improvement a cache provides is possible because computer programs execute in
nonrandom ways. Predictable program execution is the key to the success of cached systems. If a
program’s accesses to memory were random, a cache would provide little improvement to
overall system performance. The principle of locality of reference explains the performance

improvement provided by the addition of a cache memory to a system.

This principle states that, computer software programs frequently run small loops of code that
repeatedly operate on local sections of data memory. The repeated use of the same code or data

in memory, or those very near, is the reason a cache improves performance. By loading the
