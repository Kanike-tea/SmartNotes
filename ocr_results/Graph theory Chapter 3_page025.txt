3.3.1 Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search

In this subsection, we present two methods of finding a spanning tree of a connected graph.
The first of these is known as the depth-first search (DFS) and the second i is known as the
breadth-first search (BFS).

DFS Algorithm

Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph of order n, with vertices labeled v;, V2, +9 Yn in some
specified order. The DFS algorithm specifies the following steps for determining a spanning
tree T of G wherein the variable v stands for the vertex being considered.

Step 1. Assign the first vertex v; to the variable v and initialize T as the tree consisting of just
this vertex. (The vertex v; will turn out tobe the root of T aie

Step 2. Select the smallest subscript k for 2 < k < n, such that 0 md €E aad vg has 00%
already been included in T.

If no such subscript.is found, then go to Step 3. Otherwise, perform the following:
(i) Attach the edge {v, v;} to T

(ii) Assign vy; to v

(iii) Return to Step 2.
