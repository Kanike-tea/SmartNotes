Recall that the Petersen graph is a 3-regular :
fe graph is repeated in Figure 2.15(a) ie = tipanegt : ae — see Figure 1,37.
Now, consider the graph shown in Figure 2.15(b). We verify that this graph is another
representation of the Petersen graph. Suppose we delete the edges {C, D} = (2. re alon
wit their end vertices from this graph, The resulting graph is Ks. Thus, the Petersen graph
contains K3,3 as a subgraph. Therefore, the Petersen graph is eh (by Kuroto .’ski’s
theorem). ‘
