Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

2.13. Choose a database application with which you are familiar. Design a schema
and show a sample database for that application, using the notation of Fig-
ures 1.2 and 2.1. What types of additional information and constraints
would you like to represent in the schema? Think of several users of your
database, and design a view for each.

2.14. Ifyou were designing a Web-based system to make airline reservations and sell
airline tickets, which DBMS architecture would you choose from Section 2.5?
Why? Why would the other architectures not be a good choice?

2.15. Consider Figure 2.1. In addition to constraints relating the values of col-
umns in one table to columns in another table, there are also constraints that
impose restrictions on values in a column or a combination of columns
within a table. One such constraint dictates that a column or a group of col-
umns must be unique across all rows in the table. For example, in the
STUDENT table, the Student_number column must be unique (to prevent two
different students from having the same Student_number). Identify the col-
umn or the group of columns in the other tables that must be unique across
all rows in the table.

Selected Bibliography

Many database textbooks, including Date (2004), Silberschatz et al. (2011), Ramak-
rishnan and Gehrke (2003), Garcia-Molina et al. (2002, 2009), and Abiteboul et al.
(1995), provide a discussion of the various database concepts presented here.
Tsichritzis and Lochovsky (1982) is an early textbook on data models. Tsichritzis
and Klug (1978) and Jardine (1977) present the three-schema architecture, which
was first suggested in the DBTG CODASYL report (1971) and later in an American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) report (1975). An in-depth analysis of the rela-
tional data model and some of its possible extensions is given in Codd (1990). The
proposed standard for object-oriented databases is described in Cattell et al. (2000).
Many documents describing XML are available on the Web, such as XML (2005).

Examples of database utilities are the ETI Connect, Analyze and Transform tools
(http://www.eti.com) and the database administration tool, DBArtisan, from
Embarcadero Technologies (http://www.embarcadero.com).
