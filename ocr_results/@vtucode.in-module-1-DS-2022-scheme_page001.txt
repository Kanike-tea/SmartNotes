DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

Field: is a single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity. Record
is the collection of field values of a given entity.

File: is the collection of records of the entities in a given entity set.

Each record in a file may contain many field items but the value in a certain field may
uniquely determine the record in the file. Such a field K is called a primary key and the
values k1, k2, ..... in such a field are called keys or key values.

Records may also be classified according to length.

A file can have fixed-length records or variable-length records.

¢ In fixed-length records, all the records contain the same data items with the same amount of
space assigned to each data item.

e In variable-length records file records may contain different lengths. Example: Student
records have variable lengths, since different students take different numbers of courses.
Variable-length records have a minimum and a maximum length. The above organization of
data into fields, records and files may not be complex enough to maintain and efficiently
process certain collections of data. For this reason, data are also organized into more complex

types of structures.

CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES
Data Structures can be divided into two categories,
i) Primitive Data Structures

ii) Non-Primitive Data Structures

-—> void

— ‘Character

[—> Primitive > Integer
> Float
Data Structures >| — Double

Linear Non- Linear
> Arrays > Trees
> Structure > Graphs

> Stacks

> Queues
