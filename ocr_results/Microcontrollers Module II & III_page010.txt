The long multiply instructions (SMLAL, SMULL, UMLAL, and UMULL) produce a 64-bit
result. The result is too large to fit a single 32-bit register so the result is placed in two
registers labeled RdLo and RdHi. RdLo holds the lower 32 bits of the 64-bit result, and RdHi
holds the higher 32 bits of the 64-bit result. Example 3.12 shows an example of a long

unsigned multiply instruction.
Example 2:
UMULL 10,r1,12, 13 ; [rl 10] = 12*r3

The instruction multiplies registers r2 and r3 and places the result into register r0 and rl.
Register r0 contains the lower 32 bits, and register r1 contains the higher 32 bits of the 64-bit

result.

2.8 Branch Instructions

A branch instruction changes the flow of execution or is used to call a routine. This type of

instruction allows programs to have subroutines, if-then-else structures, and loops.

The change of execution flow forces the program counter pc to point to a new address. The

ARMvVS5E instruction set includes four different branch instructions.

Syntax: B{<cond>} label
BL {<cond>} label
BX{<cond>}Rm

BLX{<cond>} label | Rm
