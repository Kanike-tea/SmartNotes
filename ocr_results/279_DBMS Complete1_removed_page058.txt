Relational Algebra:

Basic operations:

1.

akwnD

6.

Selection (o) Selects a subset of rows from relation.
Projection (z) Selects a subset of columns from relation.
Cross-product (x) Allows us to combine two relations.
Set-difference (11) Tuples in relation. 1, but not in relationn. 2.
Union (U) Tuples in reln. 1 and in reln. 2.

Rename( p) Use new name for the Tables or fields.

Additional operations:

7.

Intersection (9), Join’), Division(+): Not essential, but (very!) useful.

Since each operation returns a relation, operations can be composed! (Algebra is

Projection
> Deletes

“closed”.)

attributes that are not in projection list.

> Schema of result contains exactly the fields in the projection list, with the same names that

they ha

d in the (only) input relation. ( Unary Operation)

» Projection operator has to eliminate duplicates! (as it returns a relation which is a set)
o Note: real systems typically don’t do duplicate elimination unless the user explicitly

Tritle( BOOK) =

Selection

asks for it. (Duplicate values may be representing different real world entity or
relationship).
Example: Consider the BOOK table:

Acc-No _| Title Author

100 “DBMS” “Silbershatz”

200 “DBMS” “Ramanuj”

300 “COMPILER” | “Silbershatz”

400 “COMPILER” | “Ullman”

500 “OS” “Sudarshan”

600 “DBMS” “Silbershatz”
Title
“DBMS”
“COMPILER”

>» Selects rows that satisfy selection condition.

> No duplicates in result

> Schema of result identical to schema of (only) input relation.

> Result relation can be the input for another relational algebra operation! (Operator
composition.)

Example: For the example given above:
OAce-no>300( BOOK) =
Acc- | Title Author
No

400 |“COMPILER | “Ullman”

500__| “OS” “Sudarshan”
