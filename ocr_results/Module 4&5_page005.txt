Microcontrollers - BCS402

Each exception is dealt with according to the priority level set out in Table 3. The following is a

summary of the exceptions and how they should be handled, starting with the highest.

The Reset exception is the highest priority exception and is always taken whenever it is signaled.

The reset handler initializes the system, including setting up memory and caches.

External interrupt sources should be initialized before enabling IRQ or FIQ interrupts to avoid
the possibility of spurious interrupts occurring before the appropriate handler has been set up.

The reset handler must also set up the stack pointers for all processor modes.

During the first few instructions of the handler, it is assumed that no exceptions or interrupts will
occur. The code should be designed to avoid SWIs, undefined instructions, and memory accesses
that may abort, that is, the handler is carefully implemented to avoid further triggering of an

exception.

Data Abort exceptions occur when the memory controller or MMU indicates that an invalid
memory address has been accessed (for example, if there is no physical memory for an address)
or when the current code attempts to read or write to memory without the correct access
permissions. An FIQ exception can be raised within a Data Abort handler since FIQ exceptions
are not disabled. When the FIQ is completely serviced, control is returned back to the Data Abort

handler.

A Fast Interrupt Request (FIQ) exception occurs when an external peripheral sets the FIQ pin to
nFIQ. An FIQ exception is the highest priority interrupt. The core disables both IRQ and FIQ
exceptions on entry into the FIQ handler. Thus, no external source can interrupt the processor
unless the IRQ and/or FIQ exceptions are re enabled by software. It is desirable that the FIQ
handler (and also the abort, SWI, and IRQ handlers) is carefully designed to service the

exception efficiently.

An Interrupt Request (IRQ) exception occurs when an external peripheral sets the IRQ pin to
nIRQ. An IRQ exception is the second-highest priority interrupt. The IRQ handler will be
entered if neither an FIQ exception nor Data Abort exception occurs. On entry to the IRQ
handler, the IRQ exceptions are disabled and should remain disabled until the current interrupt

source has been cleared.
