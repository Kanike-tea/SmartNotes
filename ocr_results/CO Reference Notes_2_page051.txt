Main memory address

Fiqure 8.16 —_Direct-mapped cache.

« The memory-address is divided into 3 fields:
1) Low Order 4 bit field
> Selects one of 16 words in a block.
2) 7 bit cache-block field
> 7-bits determine the cache-position in which new block must be stored.
3) 5 bit Tag field
> 5-bits memory-address of block is stored in 5 tag-bits associated with cache-location.
¢ As execution proceeds,5-bit tag field of memory-address is compared with tag-bits associated
with cache-location.If they match, then the desired word is in that block of the cache.
Otherwise, the block containing required word must be first read from the memory.
And then the word must be loaded into the cache.

© The memory-block can be placed into any cache-block position. (Figure 8.17).

© 12 tag-bits will identify a memory-block when it is resolved in the cache.

© Tag-bits of an address received from processor are compared to the tag-bits of each block of cache.
© This comparison is done to see if the desired block is present.
