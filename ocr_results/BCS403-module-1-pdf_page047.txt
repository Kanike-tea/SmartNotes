entity to which each dependent is related. Each employee entity is said to own the dependent entities that

are related to it.

A weak entity type always has a total participation constraint (existence dependency) with respect to its
identifying relationship because a weak entity cannot be identified without an owner entity. A weak entity
type normally has a partial key, which is the attribute that can uniquely identify weak entities that are
related to the same owner entity. In our example, if we assume that no two dependents of the same

employee ever have the same first name, the attribute Name of DEPENDENT is the partial key.
In ER diagrams, both a weak entity type and its identifying relationship are distinguished by surrounding

their boxes and diamonds with double lines. The partial key attribute is underlined with adashed or dotted

line.
