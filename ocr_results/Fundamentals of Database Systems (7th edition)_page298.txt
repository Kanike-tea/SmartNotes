Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus

INTERSECTION operation in Q? can be replaced by a NATURAL JOIN. As an exercise,
try to do each of these sample queries using different operations.'* We showed how to
write queries as single relational algebra expressions for queries Q1, Q4, and Q6. Try
to write the remaining queries as single expressions. In Chapters 6 and 7 and in Sec-
tions 8.6 and 8.7, we show how these queries are written in other relational languages.

8.6 The Tuple Relational Calculus

In this and the next section, we introduce another formal query language for the
relational model called relational calculus. This section introduces the language
known as tuple relational calculus, and Section 8.7 introduces a variation called
domain relational calculus. In both variations of relational calculus, we write one
declarative expression to specify a retrieval request; hence, there is no description
of how, or in what order, to evaluate a query. A calculus expression specifies what is
to be retrieved rather than how to retrieve it. Therefore, the relational calculus is
considered to be a nonprocedural language. This differs from relational algebra,
where we must write a sequence of operations to specify a retrieval request in a par-
ticular order of applying the operations; thus, it can be considered as a procedural
way of stating a query. It is possible to nest algebra operations to form a single
expression; however, a certain order among the operations is always explicitly spec-
ified in a relational algebra expression. This order also influences the strategy for
evaluating the query. A calculus expression may be written in different ways, but
the way it is written has no bearing on how a query should be evaluated.

It has been shown that any retrieval that can be specified in the basic relational alge-
bra can also be specified in relational calculus, and vice versa; in other words, the
expressive power of the languages is identical. This led to the definition of the con-
cept of a relationally complete language. A relational query language L is considered
relationally complete if we can express in L any query that can be expressed in
relational calculus. Relational completeness has become an important basis for
comparing the expressive power of high-level query languages. However, as we saw
in Section 8.4, certain frequently required queries in database applications cannot
be expressed in basic relational algebra or calculus. Most relational query languages
are relationally complete but have more expressive power than relational algebra or
relational calculus because of additional operations such as aggregate functions,
grouping, and ordering. As we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the
relational calculus is important for two reasons. First, it has a firm basis in mathe-
matical logic. Second, the standard query language (SQL) for RDBMSs has its basic
foundation in the tuple relational calculus.

Our examples refer to the database shown in Figures 5.6 and 5.7. We will use the
same queries that were used in Section 8.5. Sections 8.6.6, 8.6.7, and 8.6.8 discuss
dealing with universal quantifiers and safety of expression issues. Students inter-
ested in a basic introduction to tuple relational calculus may skip these sections.

'2When queries are optimized (see Chapters 18 and 19), the system will choose a particular sequence
of operations that corresponds to an execution strategy that can be executed efficiently.
