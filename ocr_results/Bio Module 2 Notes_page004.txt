Properties of PHA

ae ta

Biodegradable Biocompatible Thermostable

Properties of PHA
PHAs have several properties that make them ideal for use as bioplastics, including:

e Biodegradability: PHAs are biodegradable and can break down into water and carbon
dioxide, reducing their impact on the environment.

¢ Biocompatibility: PHAs are biocompatible and can be used in medical devices, such
assutures and implants, without causing adverse reactions in the body.

e Mechanical properties: PHAs have similar mechanical properties to traditional
petroleum-based plastics, making them suitable for various applications.

e Processing: PHAs can be processed using conventional plastic processing techniques,

suchas injection molding, blow molding, and extrusion.
