coatings can be used on the exterior of buildings to reduce the need for cleaning and
maintenance, while super hydrophobic coatings can be used to prevent icing on aircraft wings.

44.1 Super Hydrophobic Effect

The Principle of Super hydrophobic Surfaces

The super hydrophobic effect refers to the ability of certain surfaces to repel water and
resist wetting. Super hydrophobic surfaces are characterized by a high contact angle between
water droplets and the surface, typically over 150 degrees, and a low contact angle hysteresis,
meaning that the droplets roll off the surface with ease.

The super hydrophobic effect is achieved through the use of various techniques. These
techniques create a surface structure that traps air between the surface and the water droplets,
reducing the contact area between them and making it more difficult for the droplets to wet the
surface.

Materials and Examples

Super hydrophobic surfaces are created by modifying the surface chemistry and
structure of materials to achieve extremely high water repellency. Several materials and
coating techniques are used to prepare super hydrophobic surfaces. Here are some commonly
used materials and examples:

e Fluoropolymers: Fluoropolymer-based coatings are widely used for super hydrophobic
surfaces due to their low surface energy and water-repellent properties. Examples
include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)
coatings.

e  Silica-based Nanoparticles: Silica nanoparticles can be functionalized and applied to
surfaces to create super hydrophobicity. These nanoparticles create a rough surface
structure that traps air pockets, preventing water from wetting the surface. Additionally,
the surface can be modified with hydrophobic molecules. Examples include silica
nanoparticles coated with hydrophobic agents like alkylsilanes.

e Carbon-based Materials: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and carbon nanofibers
