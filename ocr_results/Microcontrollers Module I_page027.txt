There are three hardware extensions ARM wraps around the core:
i) Cache and tightly coupled memory
ii) Memory management

iii) Coprocessor interface.

Cache and Tightly Coupled Memory

The cache is a block of fast memory placed between main memory and the core. It allows for
more efficient fetches from some memory types. With a cache the processor core can run for
the majority of the time without having to wait for data from slow external memory.

Most ARM-based embedded systems use a single-level cache internal to the processor. ARM
has two forms of cache. The first is found attached to the Von Neumann-style cores. It

combines both data and instruction into a single unified cache, as shown in Figure 10.

The second form, attached to the Harvard-style cores as shown in figure 11, has separate
caches for data and instruction. A cache provides an overall increase in performance but at

the expense of predictable execution.

But for real-time systems it is paramount that code execution is deterministic— the time

taken for loading and storing instructions or data must be predictable. This is achieved using
