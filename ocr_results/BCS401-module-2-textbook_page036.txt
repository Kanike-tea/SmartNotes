Thus, to multiply two 2 x 2 matrices, Strassen’s algorithm makes seven multipli-
cations and 18 additions/subtractions, whereas the brute-force algorithm requires
eight multiplications and four additions. These numbers should not lead us to
multiplying 2 x 2 matrices by Strassen’s algorithm. Its importance stems from its
asymptotic superiority as matrix order n goes to infinity.

Let A and B be twon x n matrices where n is a power of 2. (Ifn is nota power

of 2, matrices can be padded with rows and columns of zeros.) We can divide A,
B, and their product C into four n/2 x n/2 submatrices each as follows:

It is not difficult to verify that one can treat these submatrices as numbers to
get the correct product. For example, Cog can be computed either as Agg * Bog +
Aoy * Big or as M; + My— Ms + M7 where M;, My, Ms, and M; are found by
Strassen’s formulas, with the numbers replaced by the corresponding submatrices.
If the seven products of n/2 x n/2 matrices are computed recursively by the same
method, we have Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication.

Let us evaluate the asymptotic efficiency of this algorithm. If M(n) is the
number of multiplications made by Strassen’s algorithm in multiplying two n x n
matrices (where n isa power of 2), we get the following recurrence relation for it:

M(n)=7M(n/2) forn>1, M()=1.

Since n =2*,
M2") =7M 2-4 =70 M2) = Puy
=7TM(2t)...= 72k = 7,

Since k = log, n,
M(n) = 782" = p!027 = 92-807,

which is smaller than n required by the brute-force algorithm.

Since this savings in the number of multiplications was achieved at the expense
of making extra additions, we must check the number of additions A(n) made by
Strassen’s algorithm. To multiply two matrices of order n > 1, the algorithm needs
to multiply seven matrices of order n/2 and make 18 additions/subtractions of
matrices of size n/2; when n = 1, no additions are made since two numbers are
