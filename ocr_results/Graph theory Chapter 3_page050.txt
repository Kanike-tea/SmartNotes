4. Prefix coden an Weighted tree lw

Accordingly, the code for the given word ENGINEERING is

0110111001001011 100010111

Obtain an optimal prefix code for the message LETTER RECEIVED. Indicate
‘the code. ar
p The given message consists of letters L, E, T, R, C, I, V, D with frequencies 1,5, 2,2, 1, 1,
|, | respectively. Further, there is one blank space (2) between the two words of the message.

First, we arrange the letters and © in the non-decreasing order of their weights (frequen-
cies), Their representation as isolated vertices is shown below /

We now construct an optimal tree having these symbols as leaves by using the Huffman’s
ure. The graphs obtained.in successive steps of the procedure are shown below in Fig-
3,54(ii)-(ix) in the order of their oceurrence,, The labeled version of the final graph is
