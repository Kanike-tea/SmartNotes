in the source code. The main disadvantages are the loss of flexibility in
changing the query at runtime, and the fact that all changes to queries must
go through the whole recompilation process. In addition, because the que-
ries are known beforehand, the choice of program variables to hold the
query results is a simple task, and so the programming of the application is
generally easier. However, for complex applications where queries have to
be generated at runtime, the function call approach will be more suitable.

5. Library of Classes and Function Calls Approach. This approach provides
more flexibility in that queries can be generated at runtime if needed. How-
ever, this leads to more complex programming, as program variables that
match the columns in the query result may not be known in advance.
Because queries are passed as statement strings within the function calls, no
checking can be done at compile time. All syntax checking and query valida-
tion has to be done at runtime by preparing the query, and the programmer
must check and account for possible additional runtime errors within the
program code.

6. Database Programming Language Approach. This approach does not suf-
fer from the impedance mismatch problem, as the programming language
data types are the same as the database data types. However, programmers
must learn a new programming language rather than use a language they are
already familiar with. In addition, some database programming languages
are vendor-specific, whereas general-purpose programming languages can
easily work with systems from multiple vendors.

10.6 Summary

In this chapter we presented additional features of the SQL database language. In
particular, we presented an overview of the most important techniques for database
programming in Section 10.1. Then we discussed the various approaches to data-
base application programming in Sections 10.2 to 10.4.

In Section 10.2, we discussed the general technique known as embedded SQL,
where the queries are part of the program source code. A precompiler is typically
used to extract SQL commands from the program for processing by the DBMS, and
replacing them with function calls to the DBMS compiled code. We presented an
overview of embedded SQL, using the C programming language as host language in
our examples. We also discussed the SQL] technique for embedding SQL in Java
programs. The concepts of cursor (for embedded SQL) and iterator (for SQLJ) were
presented and illustrated by examples to show how they are used for looping over
the tuples in a query result, and extracting the attribute value into program vari-
ables for further processing.

In Section 10.3, we discussed how function call libraries can be used to access SQL
databases. This technique is more dynamic than embedding SQL, but requires
more complex programming because the attribute types and number in a query
result may be determined at runtime. An overview of the SQL/CLI standard was
