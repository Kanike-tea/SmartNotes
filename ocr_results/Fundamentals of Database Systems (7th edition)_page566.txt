Consider the example of normalizing the LOTS relation in Sections 14.4
and 14.5. Determine whether the decomposition of LOTS into {LOTS1AX,
LOTS1AY, LOTS1B, LOTS2} has the lossless join property by applying
Algorithm 15.3 and also by using the test under property NJB from Sec-
tion 14.5.1.

Show how the MVDs Ename —» and Ename —» Dname in Figure 14.15(a)
may arise during normalization into 1NF of a relation, where the attributes
Pname and Dname are multivalued.

Apply Algorithm 15.2(a) to the relation in Exercise 14.24 to determine a key
for R. Create a minimal set of dependencies G that is equivalent to F, and apply
the synthesis algorithm (Algorithm 15.4) to decompose R into 3NF relations.

Repeat Exercise 15.26 for the functional dependencies in Exercise 14.25.

Apply the decomposition algorithm (Algorithm 15.5) to the relation R and
the set of dependencies F in Exercise 15.24. Repeat for the dependencies G in
Exercise 15.25.

Apply Algorithm 15.2(a) to the relations in Exercises 14.27 and 14.28 to
determine a key for R. Apply the synthesis algorithm (Algorithm 15.4) to
decompose R into 3NF relations and the decomposition algorithm (Algo-
rithm 15.5) to decompose R into BCNF relations.

Consider the following decompositions for the relation schema R of Exer-

cise 14.24. Determine whether each decomposition has (1) the dependency

preservation property, and (2) the lossless join property, with respect to F.

Also determine which normal form each relation in the decomposition is in.

a. D, = {Rj, Ro, Rs, Ry Rs}; Ry = {A, B, Ch, Ry = {A, D, E}, R3 = {B, Fh,
Ry={F, G, H}, Rs = {D, 1 J}

b. Dy = {Rj, Ro, R3}; Ry = {A, B, C, D, E}, Ry = {B, F, G, H}, R3 = {D, LJ}

c. Ds = {Ry, Ro, Ry, Ry Rs}; Ry = {A, B, C, D}, Ry = {D, E}, Rs = {B, Fh,
Ry ={F, G, H}, Rs = {D, LJ}

Laboratory Exercises

Note: These exercises use the DBD (Data Base Designer) system that is described
in the laboratory manual. The relational schema R and set of functional dependen-
cies F need to be coded as lists. As an example, R and F for Problem 14.24 are

coded as:
R=[a, b,c, d,e,f,g,h, i,j]
F={[fa, b],[el],
(lal,{4, el],
