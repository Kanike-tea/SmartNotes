There is some similarity between Figures 17.1, 17.2, and 17.3 and Figures 16.11
and 16.12. An index is somewhat similar to dynamic hashing (described in Sec-
tion 16.8.3) and to the directory structures used for extendible hashing. Both are
searched to find a pointer to the data block containing the desired record. A main
difference is that an index search uses the values of the search field itself, whereas a
hash directory search uses the binary hash value that is calculated by applying the
hash function to the search field.
