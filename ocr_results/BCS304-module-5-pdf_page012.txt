Figure : Extended binary trees corresponding to above binary Trees

1) Height-Biased Leftist Trees.

shortest (x) = ( if.x is an external node
7 | 1 + min (shortest (left child (x)), shortest (right —child (x))} otherwise

Definition: A /eftist sree is a binary tree such that if it is not empty, then

shortest (left —child (x)) 2 shortest (right — child (x))

for every internal node +.

» Definition of A Min (Max) Leftist Tree

» Amin leftist tree is a leftist tree in which the key value in each node is smaller than
the key value in its children (if any).

A max leftist tree is a leftist tree in which the key value in each node is greater than
the key value in its children (if any).

» Amin(max) leftist tree is a leftist tree that is also a min(max) tree
Example of min leftist tree :
