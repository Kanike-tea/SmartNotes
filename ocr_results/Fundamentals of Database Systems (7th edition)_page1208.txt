QBE also has data definition capabilities. The tables of a database can be specified
interactively, and a table definition can also be updated by adding, renaming, or
removing a column. We can also specify various characteristics for each column,
such as whether it is a key of the relation, what its data type is, and whether an index
should be created on that field. QBE also has facilities for view definition, authoriza-
tion, storing query definitions for later use, and so on.

QBE does not use the linear style of SQL; rather, it is a two-dimensional language
because users specify a query moving around the full area of the screen. Tests on
users have shown that QBE is easier to learn than SQL, especially for nonspecialists.
In this sense, QBE was the first user-friendly visual relational database language.

More recently, numerous other user-friendly interfaces have been developed for
commercial database systems. The use of menus, graphics, and forms is now becom-
ing quite common. Filling forms partially to issue a search request is akin to using
QBE. Visual query languages, which are still not so common, are likely to be offered
with commercial relational databases in the future.
