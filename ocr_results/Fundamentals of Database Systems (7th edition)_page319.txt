Relational Database
Design by ER- and
EER-to-Relational Mapping

Ts chapter discusses how to design a relational
database schema based on a conceptual schema
design. Figure 3.1 presented a high-level view of the database design process. In this
chapter we focus on the logical database design step of database design, which is
also known as data model mapping. We present the procedures to create a rela-
tional schema from an entity-relationship (ER) or an enhanced ER (EER) schema.
Our discussion relates the constructs of the ER and EER models, presented in
Chapters 3 and 4, to the constructs of the relational model, presented in Chapters 5
through 8. Many computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools are based on
the ER or EER models, or other similar models, as we have discussed in Chapters 3
and 4. Many tools use ER or EER diagrams or variations to develop the schema
graphically and collect information about the data types and constraints, then con-
vert the ER/EER schema automatically into a relational database schema in the
DDL of a specific relational DBMS. The design tools employ algorithms similar to
the ones presented in this chapter.

We outline a seven-step algorithm in Section 9.1 to convert the basic ER model
constructs—entity types (strong and weak), binary relationships (with various
structural constraints), n-ary relationships, and attributes (simple, composite,
and multivalued)—into relations. Then, in Section 9.2, we continue the mapping
algorithm by describing how to map EER model constructs—specializa-
tion/generalization and union types (categories)—into relations. Section 9.3 sum-
marizes the chapter.
