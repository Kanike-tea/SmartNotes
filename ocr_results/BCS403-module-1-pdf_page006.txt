Database Management System [BCS403]

A fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that the database system contains not

only the database itself but also a complete definition or description of the database structure

and constraints. This meta-data (i.e., data about data) is stored in the so-called system catalog,

which contains a description of the structure of each file, the type and storage format of each

field, and the various constraints on the data (i.e., conditions that the data must satisfy).

The system catalog is used not only by users but also by the DBMS software, which certainly

needs to "know" how the data is/structured/organized in order to interpret it in a manner
