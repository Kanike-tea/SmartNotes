Constructing a binary tree from its inorder and preorder sequences
4.5.3 Matrix multiplication

Suppose that we wish to compute the product of n matrices: M; * Mo * + ** * Mp. Since matrix

multiplication is associative, we can perform these multiplications in any order. We would like
to know how many different ways we can perform these multiplications.

For example, if n = 3, there are two possibilities:

(M, *M,)*M,
M, * (M,* My)

(MM, * M,)* My) M,
(M, *(M,*M;))*M,
M, * (M, * My)* M4)
(M, * (Mf, * (My * M4)
((M, * My) * (My © M4)

The number of distinct ways to obtain Mii and Mi +1 are bi and bp.i, respectively. Therefore,
letting

b1= 1, we have
a-t

b, = ¥ bb, 40>)
jel

Then we see that bn is the sum of all the possible binary trees formed in the following way: a
root and two subtrees with b, and by.i-1 nodes, for 0 < i <n. This explanation says that
