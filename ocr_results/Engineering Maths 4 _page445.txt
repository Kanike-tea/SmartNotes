Since all the entries in P? are positive we'conclude that the tp:m -P is regular. ‘
Hence the Markov chain having tp.m P is irreducible. ;
Next we shall find the fixed probability vector of P.

If v = (x, y, z) weshallfind v suchthat vP = v' where _

> g [Sy t8z, 4x+3z, 2x+3y] =[x, y, z]

> Sy+3z = 6x ; 4x+3z = by ; 2x+3y = 6

Solvingthesebyusing x+y+z = 1 we obtain
x= 1/43, y = 10/27, z = 8/27

Thus 0 = | 1/3, 10/27, 8/27) is the required stationary probability vector.

60. A habitual gambler is a member of two clubs A and B. He visits either of the clubs everyday
for playing cards. He never visits club A on two consecutive days. But, if he visits club B
on a particular day, then the next day he is as likely to visit club B or club A. Find the
transition matrix of this Markov chain. Also,

(a) show that the matrix is a regular stochastic matrix and find the unique fixed probability :

vector. ‘

(b) if the person had visited club B on Monday, find the probability that he visits club A on

Thursday.
>> The transition matrix P of the Markov chain is formulated as follows.

The first row corresponds to the fact that he never goes to club A on two consecittive
days which implies that he is sure to visit club B. The second row corresponds to the
fact that if he goes to B on a particular day he visits B or A on the following day.

Probability of going to A is 1/2 and probability of going to B is.also 1/2. mot
