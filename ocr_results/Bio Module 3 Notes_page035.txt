O Diabetes: People with uncontrolled diabetes are at a higher risk of developing blockages in
their blood vessels, due to damage to the blood vessels from high levels of glucose.

Oi Age: As people age, the blood vessels can become stiff and less flexible, increasing the risk
of blockages.

U Genetics: Some people may be predisposed to developing blockages in their blood vessels due
to genetic factors.

O Poor diet: A diet high in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol can increase the risk of
developing blockages in the blood vessels.

The blockages in blood vessels can have serious health consequences, such as heart attacks and
stroke. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly,
and avoiding smoking, can help reduce the risk of developing blockages in blood vessels.

Design of Stents

Stents are small, metal mesh devices that are used to treat blockages in blood vessels. They are
typically used in procedures such as angioplasty, where a balloon catheter is used to open up a
blocked blood vessel and a stent is placed to keep it open.

The design of stents can vary depending on the type of stent and the specific medical condition
it is used to treat. Some common design features of stents include:

1 Shape: Stents can be designed in a variety of shapes, including cylindrical, helical, and
spiralled, to match the shape of the blood vessel and provide adequate support.

O Material: Stents can be made of different materials, including stainless steel, cobalt
chromium, and nitinol (a type of metal that is flexible and can return to its original shape after
being expanded).

J Coating: Stents can be coated with different materials to prevent blood clots from forming
and reduce the risk of restenosis (recurrent blockage of the blood vessel).

0 Expansion mechanism: Stents can be designed to expand in different ways, such as by
balloon inflation or self-expansion, depending on the type of stent and the specific medical
condition it is used to treat.
