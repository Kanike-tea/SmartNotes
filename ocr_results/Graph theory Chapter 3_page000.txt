Trees

In this chapter we consider an important class of graphs, called Trees. Some
basic properties of trees and their immediate consequences and related con-
cepts are presented. The topic of Prefix Codes is introduced and illustrated.

3.1 Trees and their Basic properties
Oh graph is said to be atree if itis connected and has no cycles)

— Itimmediately follows that a tree has to be a simple graph; because loops and parallel edges
form cycles. ~~ :
The graphs shown in Figure 3.1 are all trees. We observe that each of these trees possesses

at least two pendant vertices. A pendant vertex of a tree is also called a leaf.

Figure 3.1

A graph which is a tree is usually denoted by T (instead of G) to emphasize the structure.

The graphs shown in Figure 3-2 are not trées. Observe that the first of these contains a cycle
Whereas the second is not connected. However, each component of the second (disconnected)
Staph is a tree. Such a graph is called a forest.
