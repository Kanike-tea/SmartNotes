c)IE (Interrupt enable) bit:
e The DMA controller enables the interrupt enable bit after the completion of

DMA operationd)Interrupt request (IRQ):

e The DMA controller requests the CPU to transfer new block of data
from source todestination by activating this bit.

The computer with DMA controller is as shown in the fig.:

e The DMA controller connects two external devices namely disk 1 and disk 2
to system bus asshown in the above fig.

e The DMA controller also interconnects high speed network devices to system
bus as shownin the above fig.

e Let us consider direct data transfer operation by means of DMA controller
without the involvement of CPU in between main memory and disk 1 as
indicated by dotted lines (in the fig.).

e To establish direct data transfer operation between main memory and disk
1. DMA controller request the processor to obtain 3 parameters namely:
1)Starting address of the memory block.
2)No of words to be transferred.
3)Type of operation (Read or Write).

e After receiving these 3 parameters from processor, DMA controller directly
transfers block ofdata main memory and external devices (disk 1).
