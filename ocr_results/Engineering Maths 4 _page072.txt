TL. Obtain the series solution of the equation Fi —2xy = 0
x fi

>> We have, y’>2xy =0

[Note that the coefficient ofy’=1= Po(x) # Oat x = 0]

_Let y= o a, x” ts .-. (2)

ie the series solution of the given d.e.

‘y’= ze a, rx. vets
Now @) Become .

z are toy ax” =0

ie, »y a,rx-1-2 x att =0

0 a 0

"We equate the coefficients of various powers of x to zero.
- [ Note that on sioing § anes forr=0,1, 2, 3, +++ the first summation has terms with
powers of x:x', x9, x1, 2, ... and the second summation has ie with powers

xt, x2, .-. We independently equate the coefficient of x1 and x to zero first and
; subsequently equate the coefficient of x’ in general to zero |

Coeff. ofa ':a)(0)=0 => a, #0
Coeff. of x°: a, (1) =6 > 4, =0

Now we shall equate the coefficient of x’ (r > 1) to zero.
