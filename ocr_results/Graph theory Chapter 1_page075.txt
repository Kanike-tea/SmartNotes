The following theorems contain some useful results

Teas 1. If a graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree,

the number of edges present in a walk is called the length of thy

involving connectedness.

then there must be a path

connecting these vertices. :
Proof: Denote the two vertices of odd degree by v1 and vz. Suppose there is no path connecting |
these. Then the graph is disconnected, and v; and v2 belong to two different components, say
H, and Hp. Consequently, each of H; and H; contains only one vertex of odd degree. ‘This
is not possible, because Hy and H are graphs and in a graph the number of vertices of odd |

degrees is always even * Hence, there must be a path connecting v; and v2. This completes the
proof.

Theorem 2. A simple graph with n vertices and k components can hav
sn — k(n - k + 1) number of edges.

Proof: In the given graph G let n; be the num
number of vertices in the second component, and so on,
in the kth component. Then
