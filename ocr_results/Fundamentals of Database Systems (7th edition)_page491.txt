14.1 Informal Design Guidelines for Relation Schemas

applied to any given design and do not require step-by-step analysis and normaliza-
tion. Sections 14.5 to 14.7 discuss further normal forms up to the fifth normal form.
In Section 14.6 we introduce the multivalued dependency (MVD), followed by the
join dependency (JD) in Section 14.7. Section 14.8 summarizes the chapter.

Chapter 15 continues the development of the theory related to the design of good
relational schemas. We discuss desirable properties of relational decomposition—
nonadditive join property and functional dependency preservation property. A
general algorithm that tests whether or not a decomposition has the nonadditive
(or lossless) join property (Algorithm 15.3 is also presented). We then discuss prop-
erties of functional dependencies and the concept of a minimal cover of dependen-
cies. We consider the bottom-up approach to database design consisting of a set of
algorithms to design relations in a desired normal form. These algorithms assume
as input a given set of functional dependencies and achieve a relational design in a
target normal form while adhering to the above desirable properties. In Chapter 15
we also define additional types of dependencies that further enhance the evaluation
of the goodness of relation schemas.

If Chapter 15 is not covered in a course, we recommend a quick introduction to the
desirable properties of decomposition from Section 15.2. and the importance of the
non-additive join property during decomposition.

14.1 Informal Design Guidelines
for Relation Schemas

Before discussing the formal theory of relational database design, we discuss four
informal guidelines that may be used as measures to determine the quality of relation
schema design:

= Making sure that the semantics of the attributes is clear in the schema

= Reducing the redundant information in tuples

= Reducing the NULL values in tuples

= Disallowing the possibility of generating spurious tuples

These measures are not always independent of one another, as we will see.

14.1.1 Imparting Clear Semantics to Attributes in Relations

Whenever we group attributes to form a relation schema, we assume that attri-
butes belonging to one relation have certain real-world meaning and a proper
interpretation associated with them. The semantics of a relation refers to its mean-
ing resulting from the interpretation of attribute values in a tuple. In Chapter 5 we
discussed how a relation can be interpreted as a set of facts. If the conceptual
design described in Chapters 3 and 4 is done carefully and the mapping procedure
in Chapter 9 is followed systematically, the relational schema design should have a
clear meaning.
