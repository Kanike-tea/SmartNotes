Figure Standstone directory layout.

The object file produced by the assembler is placed under the build/obj directory. The object file
is then linked, and the final Sandstone image is placed under the sand/build/image directory. This

image includes both the Sandstone code and the payload.

The payload image, the image that is loaded and booted by Sandstone, is found under the

sand/payload directory.

For information about the Sandstone build procedure, take a look at the readme.txt file under the
sand directory. This file contains a description of how to build the example binary image for the
ARM Evaluator-7T.

Sandstone Code Structure

Sandstone consists of a single assembly file. The file structure is broken down into a number of
steps, where each step corresponds to a stage in the execution flow of Sandstone as shown in

following table.
