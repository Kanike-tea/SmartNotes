Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts

identified by certain sequences of nucleotide symbols in the DNA sequence.
The area known as authentication is a form of identification. It ascertains
whether a user is indeed a specific user or one from an authorized class, and
it involves comparing parameters or images or signals against a database.

= Classification. Data mining can partition the data so that different classes or
categories can be identified based on combinations of parameters. For exam-
ple, customers in a supermarket can be categorized into discount-seeking
shoppers, shoppers in a rush, loyal regular shoppers, shoppers attached to
name brands, and infrequent shoppers. This classification may be used in
different analyses of customer buying transactions as a post-mining activity.
Sometimes classification based on common domain knowledge is used as an
input to decompose the mining problem and make it simpler. For instance,
health foods, party foods, and school lunch foods are distinct categories in
the supermarket business. It makes sense to analyze relationships within
and across categories as separate problems. Such categorization may be used
to encode the data appropriately before subjecting it to further data mining.

= Optimization. One eventual goal of data mining may be to optimize the use
of limited resources such as time, space, money, or materials and to maxi-
mize output variables such as sales or profits under a given set of constraints.
As such, this goal of data mining resembles the objective function used in
operations research problems that deals with optimization under constraints.

The term data mining is popularly used in a broad sense. In some situations, it
includes statistical analysis and constrained optimization as well as machine learn-
ing. There is no sharp line separating data mining from these disciplines. It is
beyond our scope, therefore, to discuss in detail the entire range of applications that
make up this vast body of work. For a detailed understanding of the topic, readers
are referred to specialized books devoted to data mining.

28.1.4 Types of Knowledge Discovered during Data Mining

The term knowledge is broadly interpreted as involving some degree of intelligence.
There is a progression from raw data to information to knowledge as we go through
additional processing. Knowledge is often classified as inductive versus deductive.
Deductive knowledge deduces new information based on applying prespecified logi-
cal rules of deduction on the given data. Data mining addresses inductive knowledge,
which discovers new rules and patterns from the supplied data. Knowledge can be
represented in many forms: In an unstructured sense, it can be represented by rules or
propositional logic. In a structured form, it may be represented in decision trees,
semantic networks, neural networks, or hierarchies of classes or frames. It is common
to describe the knowledge discovered during data mining as follows:

= Association rules. These rules correlate the presence of a set of items with
another range of values for another set of variables. Examples: (1) When a
female retail shopper buys a handbag, she is likely to buy shoes. (2) An X-ray
image containing characteristics a and b is likely to also exhibit characteristic c.
