increased.
' For good performance the table size is increased when loading density exceeds a prescribed
threshold such as 0.75 rather when the table is full.
' When the hash table is resized
= Hash function changes
= Home bucket of each key may change

Example:

Suppose the table T has 11 memory locations T[1]...... T[11] and suppose the file f contains 8
records with the following hash addresses

Records | A B Cc D E xX Y Z
H(K) 4 8 2 ll 4 11 5 1

Suppose these 8 records are entered into the hash table in the above order the hash table will look as
shown below.

Table T | X Cc Z A E Y - B - -
Address | 1 2 6 7 8 9 10 11

The average number S of probes for a successful search is S= (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3)/8=13/8=1.6
The average number U of probes for a unsuccessful search is

U= (746454443424 1424 14+1+8)/11=40/11=3.6

Example-2

Assume a 13 bucket table with 1 slot per bucket

Identifier Additive Transform x Hash

Searching a key using linear Probing

* Compute h(k)
«Examine the hash table in the order ht[h(k) +i]%b, 0<=i <=b-1, untill one of the follwing
happens
= The bucket ht[h(k) +i]%b contains the key k and the desired pair is found
= ht[h(k) +i]%b is empty; k is not in the table.
= Return to ht[h(k)], the table is full and k is not in the table
