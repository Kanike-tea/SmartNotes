Heart as a Pump System:

Architecture: The heart is a complex pump system that circulates blood throughout the body.

Left Atrium
receives oxygenated
blood from the lungs
and pumps it to the left
ventricle

Right Atrium
collects the oxygen-poor
blood from the body and

then drains the blood into

the right ventricle.

Left Ventricle
pushes oxygenated
blood into your aorta,
from which the blood is
pumped to the entire
body.

Right Ventricle
pumps the blood low in
oxygen to the lungs. The
lungs then "refill" the
blood with oxygen.

It consists of four chambers: the right atrium, the left atrium, the right ventricle, and the
left ventricle. Blood enters the right atrium from the body and is pumped into the right ventricle,
which then pumps the blood to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygenated blood returns to the
heart and enters the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the left ventricle. The left ventricle
then pumps the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.

Between each chamber, there are one-way valves that ensure the blood flows in the
correct direction and prevent backflow. The heart is also surrounded by the pericardium, a sac
that contains a small amount of fluid and helps to protect and lubricate the heart as it beats.

The Heart Beat
The heart's pumping action is controlled by a complex network of electrical and chemical
signals, which generate the rhythm of the heartbeat.
