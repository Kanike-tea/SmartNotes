VIRTUAL MEMORY ADDRESS TRANSLATION
¢ All programs and data are composed of fixed length units called Pages (Figure 8.25).
The Page consists of a block-of-words. The words occupy contiguous locations in the memory.
The pages are commonly range from 2K to 16K bytes in length.
¢ Cache Bridge speed-up the gap between main-memory and secondary-storage.
¢ Each virtual-address contains
1) Virtual Page number (Low order bit) and
2) Offset (High order bit).
Virtual Page number + Offset > specifies the location of a particular word within a page.
¢ Page-table: It contains the information about
— memory-address where the page is stored &
— current status of the page.
¢ Page-frame: An area in the main-memory that holds one page.
¢ Page-table Base Register: It contains the starting address of the page-table.
. Virtual Page Number + Page-table Base register > Gives the starting
address of the page if that page currently resides in memory.
¢ Control-bits in Page-table: The Control-bits is used to
1) Specify the status of the page while it is in memory.
2) Indicate the validity of the page.
3) Indicate whether the page has been modified during its stay in the memory.

TRANSLATION LOOKASIDE BUFFER (TLB)
e The Page-table information is used by MMU for every read/write access (Figure 8.26).
e The Page-table is placed in the memory but a copy of small portion of the page-table is located within
MMU. This small portion is called TLB (Translation LookAside Buffer).
e TLB consists of the page-table entries that corresponds to the most recently accessed pages.
e  TLB also contains the virtual-address of the entry.
