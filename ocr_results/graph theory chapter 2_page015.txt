Find the minimum number of vertices necessary for a connected simple Bray,

with 11 edges to be planar.
> By Corollary 1, we should have m < 3n ~ 6, orn 2 4(m + 6). Therefore, when m

= il, We
should have n > 17/3. Thus, the minimum number of vertices is 6. :
Show that the condition m < 3n ~ 6 is not a sufficient condition for a connectgg

simple graph with n vertices and m edges to be planar.
> Consider the Kuratowski’s second graph K33 which is simple and connected and which has
n = 6 vertices and m = 9 edges (see Figure 2.6). We check that, for this graph, m < 3n-6, But

the graph is non-planar. This counterexample proves the required result. Fs

Remark: In the above example, we have shown that the converse of the second part of Corol.
lary 1 need not be true.

Show that there does not exist a connected simple planar grapn with m =7
edges and with degree 6 = 3'.

> Suppose there is a graph G of the desired type. Then, for this graph, the inequality 6 <
(2m/n) gives 3n < 14. On the other hand, Corollary 1 requires 7 < 3n — 6, or 3n > 13. Thus,

we should have 13 < 3n < 14 which is not Possible (because n has to be a positive integer).
Hence the graph of the desired type does not exist. bg
Show that every connected simple planar graph G with less than 12 vertices
must have a vertex of degree < 4.

> Suppose every vertex of G has degree

greater than 4. Then, if dy,d>,d3,...,dy are te
degrees of n vertices of G, we have qd

On the other hand, Corollary 1 requires m < 3n~6, Thus, we should have, in view of (i)

Hence, if G has less than 12 vertices, it must have a vertex of degree < 4 s
