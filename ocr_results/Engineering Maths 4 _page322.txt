variance / S.D of the given distribution.

"| Hence we can say that the variance / S.D of the normal distribution is equal to the

Note : The graph of the probability function f(x) is a bell shaped curve symmetrical about
theline x=  andis ones the normal probability curve. The shape of the curve is as follows.
0 x,

The line x = ji divides the total area under the curve which is equal to 1,into two equal parts,

The area to the right as well-as to the left of the line x = p is 0.5
