where vp = wand v_, = v, and the edges between the vertices are understood. If there is
one u ~ y trail, it will be the one with minimum length. i

If, in the trail (i), no vertex is repeated then it is a path from u to v, and the Proof is Ove,
Otherwise, the trail (i) will be of the form

VOVIV2 «.. Vint ViVi47 Vi-1VjVit1 «+ Vn
where vj =v; for some v; and vj.
Consider the trail
Vov1V2 +--+ Vin1ViVi4 «+ Vn

which is got by skipping the vertices Vj), vis2,...V j-1,; together with all edges fir
them. Evidently, this trail is shorter than the trail (ii) and we have a contradiction. Hence,
trail with minimum length has to be a path. This completes the proof.
