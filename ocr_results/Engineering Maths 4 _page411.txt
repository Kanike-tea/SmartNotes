21. A manufacturer claiited that atleast 95% of the equipment which he supplied to a factory
conformed to specifications . An examination of a sample of 200 pieces of equipment
revealed that 18 of them were faulty. Test his claim at a significance level.of 1% and 5%.

>> Let p be the probability of success which being the probability of the equipment ots
supplied to the factory conformal to the specifications: © °°

by data p = 0.95 and hence q = 0.05
- Hy:p = 0.95and the claim is correct:
H,:p<0.95 and the claim is false. .

We choose'the one tailed test to determine whether the supply is conformal to the
specification. : .

p= np = 200x095 = 190

o = Vnpq = ¥200x0.95x 0.05 = 3.082 °
Expected numberof equipments according to the specification= 190
‘Actual number = 182 since 18 out of 200 were faulty rs

. difference= 190- '82 = 8

a

The value of Zis greater than the critical value 1.645 at 5% level and 2.33 at 1% level of
significance. The claim of the manufacturer (null hypothesis that the claim is correct) is
rejected at 5% as: well as at 1% level of significance in accordence with the’ one
tailed test. ee ns ’ ‘
