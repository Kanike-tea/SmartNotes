Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts

including legacy databases (from hierarchical and network models; no spe-
cific knowledge of these models is needed) as well as relational databases,
which are geographically distributed so that global applications can be sup-
ported. Assume that alternative 1 is to keep all databases as they are, whereas
alternative 2 is to first convert them to relational and then support the appli-
cations over a distributed integrated database.

a. Draw two schematic diagrams for the above alternatives showing the
linkages among appropriate schemas. For alternative 1, choose the
approach of providing export schemas for each database and construct-
ing unified schemas for each application.

b. List the steps that you would have to go through under each alternative
from the present situation until global applications are viable.

c. Compare these alternatives from the issues of:

i. design time considerations
ii. runtime considerations

Selected Bibliography

The textbooks by Ceri and Pelagatti (1984a) and Ozsu and Valduriez (1999) are
devoted to distributed databases. Peterson and Davie (2008), Tannenbaum (2003),
and Stallings (2007) cover data communications and computer networks. Comer
(2008) discusses networks and internets. Ozsu et al. (1994) has a collection of papers
on distributed object management.

Most of the research on distributed database design, query processing, and optimi-
zation occurred in the 1980s and 1990s; we quickly review the important references
here. Distributed database design has been addressed in terms of horizontal and
vertical fragmentation, allocation, and replication. Ceri et al. (1982) defined the
concept of minterm horizontal fragments. Ceri et al. (1983) developed an integer
programming-based optimization model for horizontal fragmentation and alloca-
tion. Navathe et al. (1984) developed algorithms for vertical fragmentation based
on attribute affinity and showed a variety of contexts for vertical fragment alloca-
tion. Wilson and Navathe (1986) present an analytical model for optimal allocation
of fragments. Elmasri et al. (1987) discuss fragmentation for the ECR model; Karla-
palem et al. (1996) discuss issues for distributed design of object databases. Navathe
et al. (1996) discuss mixed fragmentation by combining horizontal and vertical
fragmentation; Karlapalem et al. (1996) present a model for redesign of distributed
databases.

Distributed query processing, optimization, and decomposition are discussed in
Hevner and Yao (1979), Kerschberg et al. (1982), Apers et al. (1983), Ceri and Pela-
gatti (1984), and Bodorick et al. (1992). Bernstein and Goodman (1981) discuss the
theory behind semijoin processing. Wong (1983) discusses the use of relationships
in relation fragmentation. Concurrency control and recovery schemes are discussed
in Bernstein and Goodman (1981a). Kumar and Hsu (1998) compile some articles
