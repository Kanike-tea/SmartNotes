document. The idea is that terms that capture the essence of a document occur
frequently in the document (that is, their TF is high), but if such a term were to be
a good term that discriminates the document from others, it must occur in only a
few documents in the general population (that is, its IDF should be high as well).

IDF values can be easily computed for a fixed collection of documents. In case of
Web search engines, taking a representative sample of documents approximates
IDF computation. The following formulas can be used:

Thi] Dh
isl to|V|
IDF, =log(N/n,)
In these formulas, the meaning of the symbols is:

TF, is the normalized term frequency of term iin document Dj.
fi is the number of occurrences of term i in document Dj.

IDF; is the inverse document frequency weight for term i.

Nis the number of documents in the collection.

n; is the number of documents in which term i occurs.

Note that if a term i occurs in all documents, then n; = N and hence IDF; = log(1)
becomes zero, nullifying its importance and creating a situation where division by
zero can occur. The weight of term i in document j, wip is computed based on its
TF-IDF value in some techniques. To prevent division by zero, it is common to add
a 1 to the denominator in the formulae such as the cosine formula above.

Sometimes, the relevance of the document with respect to a query (rel(Dj,Q)) is
directly measured as the sum of the TF-IDF values of the terms in the query Q:

rel(D,,Q)= ) jeg TF x IDF;

The normalization factor (similar to the denominator of the cosine formula) is
incorporated into the TF-IDF formula itself, thereby measuring relevance of a doc-
ument to the query by the computation of the dot product of the query and docu-
ment vectors.

The Rocchio" algorithm is a well-known relevance feedback algorithm based on
the vector space model that modifies the initial query vector and its weights in
response to user-identified relevant documents. It expands the original query vec-
tor q to a new vector q, as follows:
