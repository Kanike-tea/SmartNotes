27.7.7 Practical Applications of Web Analysis

Web Analytics. The goal of web analytics is to understand and optimize the per-
formance of Web usage. This requires collecting, analyzing, and monitoring the
performance of Internet usage data. On-site Web analytics measures the perfor-
mance of a Web site in a commercial context. This data is typically compared
against key performance indicators to measure effectiveness or performance of the
Web site as a whole, and it can be used to improve a Web site or improve the mar-
keting strategies.

Web Spamming. It has become increasingly important for companies and indi-
viduals to have their Web sites/Web pages appear in the top search results. To
achieve this, it is essential to understand search engine ranking algorithms and to
present the information in one’s page in such a way that the page is ranked high
when the respective keywords are queried. There is a thin line separating legitimate
page optimization for business purposes and spamming. Web spamming is thus
defined as a deliberate activity to promote one’s page by manipulating the results
returned by the search engines. Web analysis may be used to detect such pages and
discard them from search results.

Web Security. Web analysis can be used to find interesting usage patterns of Web
sites. If any flaw in a Web site has been exploited, it can be inferred using Web
analysis, thereby allowing the design of more robust Web sites. For example, the
backdoor or information leak of Web servers can be detected by using Web analysis
techniques on abnormal Web application log data. Security analysis techniques
such as intrusion detection and denial-of-service attacks are based on Web access
pattern analysis.

Web Crawlers. These are programs that visit Web pages and create copies of all
the visited pages so they can be processed by a search engine for indexing the down-
loaded pages and providing fast searches. Another use of crawlers is to automati-
cally check and maintain Web sites. For example, the HTML code and the links ina
Web site can be checked and validated by the crawler. Another unfortunate use of
crawlers is to collect e-mail addresses and other personal information from Web
pages; the information is subsequently used in sending spam e-mails.

In this section, we review a few concepts that are being considered in recent research
work in information retrieval.

27.8.1 Faceted Search

Faceted search is a technique that allows for an integrated search and navigation
experience by allowing users to explore by filtering available information. This
search technique is often used in ecommerce Web sites and applications and
