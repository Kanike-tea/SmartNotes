Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

NULL values. Incorporating different types of NULL values into relational model opera-
tions has proven difficult and is outside the scope of our presentation.

The exact meaning of a NULL value governs how it fares during arithmetic aggrega-
tions or comparisons with other values. For example, a comparison of two NULL
values leads to ambiguities—if both Customer A and B have NULL addresses, it does
not mean they have the same address. During database design, it is best to avoid
NULL values as much as possible. We will discuss this further in Chapters 7 and 8 in
the context of operations and queries, and in Chapter 14 in the context of database
design and normalization.

Interpretation (Meaning) of a Relation. The relation schema can be interpreted
as a declaration or a type of assertion. For example, the schema of the STUDENT
relation of Figure 5.1 asserts that, in general, a student entity has a Name, Ssn,
Home_phone, Address, Office_phone, Age, and Gpa. Each tuple in the relation can
then be interpreted as a fact or a particular instance of the assertion. For example,
the first tuple in Figure 5.1 asserts the fact that there is a STUDENT whose Name is
Benjamin Bayer, Ssn is 305-61-2435, Age is 19, and so on.

Notice that some relations may represent facts about entities, whereas other rela-
tions may represent facts about relationships. For example, a relation schema
MAJORS (Student_ssn, Department_code) asserts that students major in academic
disciplines. A tuple in this relation relates a student to his or her major discipline.
Hence, the relational model represents facts about both entities and relationships
uniformly as relations. This sometimes compromises understandability because
one has to guess whether a relation represents an entity type or a relationship type.
We introduced the entity-relationship (ER) model in detail in Chapter 3, where the
entity and relationship concepts were described in detail. The mapping procedures
in Chapter 9 show how different constructs of the ER/EER conceptual data models
(see Part 2) get converted to relations.

An alternative interpretation of a relation schema is as a predicate; in this case, the
values in each tuple are interpreted as values that satisfy the predicate. For example,
the predicate STUDENT (Name, Ssn, ...) is true for the five tuples in relation STUDENT
of Figure 5.1. These tuples represent five different propositions or facts in the
real world. This interpretation is quite useful in the context of logical programming
languages, such as Prolog, because it allows the relational model to be used within
these languages (see Section 26.5). An assumption called the closed world assumption
states that the only true facts in the universe are those present within the extension
(state) of the relation(s). Any other combination of values makes the predicate false.
This interpretation is useful when we consider queries on relations based on
relational calculus in Section 8.6.

5.1.3 Relational Model Notation
We will use the following notation in our presentation:

= Arelation schema R of degree n is denoted by R(Aj, Ao, ... » An)
