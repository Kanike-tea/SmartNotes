* 8. A switch board can handle only 4 telephone calls per minute. If the incoming calls
per minute follow a - Poisson distribution with parameter 3, find the probability

that the switch board is over taxed in any one minute.

9. A travel agency has 2 cars which it hires daily. The number of demands for a car
on each day is distributed as a Poisson variate with mean 1.5 Find the probability
that on a particular day (i) there was no demand (ii) a demand is refused.

11. Find the value of k such that the function
kes 1l<x<3
f(x) = .
0 otherwise

is a probability density function of a continuous random variable. Also find
. P(15 <x < 25)

12. The p.d.f of a continuous random variable is given by
kx(1-x)e&,0<x<1
p(x) =4" ;
0 otherwise
Find k and hence find the mean and the standard deviation.

13. The life of a compressor manufactured by a company is known to be 200 months
on an average following an exponential distribution. Find the probability that the
life of a compressor of that company is

(i) less than 200 months (ii) between 100 months and 25 years
