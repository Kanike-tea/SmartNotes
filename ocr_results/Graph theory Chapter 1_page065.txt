2. A trail is an open walk in which a vertex can appear more than once but an edge ca of

3. A circuit is a closed walk in which a vertex can apear more than once but an edge cana!
appear more than once.
4. A path is an open walk in which neither a vertex nor an edge can appear more than of

Every path is a trail, but a trail need not be a path.

5. A cycle is a closed walk in which neither a vertex nor an edge can appear more Mf
once. Every cycle is a circuit; but, a circuit need not be a cycle.
