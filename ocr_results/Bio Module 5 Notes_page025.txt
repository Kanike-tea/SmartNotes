Biocompatible and biodegradable materials are chosen for the fabrication of the scaffold.
Common materials include synthetic polymers, such as polycaprolactone (PCL) or poly(lactic-
co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and natural polymers, such as collagen or gelatin.

3D Printing Process:

The 3D printing process begins by loading the selected material into the 3D printer. The printer
then deposits or solidifies the material layer by layer, following the digital design. The printing
technology can vary, including extrusion-based methods, inkjet printing, or stereolithography.

J
Pore Formation:
During the printing process, the scaffold is designed to have a porous structure with
interconnected pores. These pores provide space for cell infiltration, nutrient supply, and

vascularization. Various techniques can be used to control the pore size, distribution, and
interconnectivity.

Post-Processing:

After the scaffold is printed, post-processing steps may be performed to refine the scaffold's
properties. This can include removing any support structures, sterilization, and surface treatments
to enhance biocompatibility.

Cell Seeding and Culture:

Once the scaffold is prepared, it can be seeded with bone-forming cells, such as mesenchymal
stem cells or osteoblasts. The seeded scaffold is then cultured under appropriate conditions to
promote cell attachment, proliferation, and the formation of new bone tissue within the scaffold.

J

Implantation:

Once the scaffold-based construct has undergone sufficient maturation, it can be implanted into
the patient's body. The scaffold provides structural support while the surrounding cells and blood
vessels infiltrate and replace the scaffold with newly formed bone tissue. Over time, the scaffold
degrades, leaving behind functional regenerated bone.

Materials Used for 3D Printing of Bone

Materials used for 3D printing of bones can vary, depending on the specific 3D printing
technique used and the desired outcome. Some of the most commonly used materials for 3D
printing of bones include:
