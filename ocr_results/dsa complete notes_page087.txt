Since each node in a binary tree has a maximum degree of 2, the maximum number of nodes
on level i is two times the maximum number of nodes on level i-1,

The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k is

Lemma 2: [Relation between number of leaf nodes and degree-2 nodes]: For any non empty binary
tree, T, if nO is the number of leaf nodes and n2 the number of nodes of degree 2, then nO = n2 + 1.

Proof:

Let nl be the number of nodes of degree one and n the total number of nodes. Since all
nodes in T are at most of degree two, we have

n=n0+n1+n2--------- (dd)

If we count the number of branches in a binary tree, we see that every node except the root has
a branch leading into it.

If B is the number of branches, then n = B + 1 --------- (2)

All branches stem out from a node of degree one or two.

Thus, B =n1 + 2n2. Hence, we obtain -- (-3)

Sum of the branches that stem out of a node(outdegree) is always equal to the sum of the
branches that stem into a node(indegree). Therefore Substitutuing eq(3) in eq(2)

n=B+1
n=nl+2n241 0! (4)
Subtracting Eq. (4) from Eq. (1) and rearranging terms, we get
n0=n2+1
