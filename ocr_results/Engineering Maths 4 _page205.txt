Proof :

Let us introduce a cross-cut in the form of a line segment PQ with the point P on
C, and Q on C,. Then the curve PRSPQTUQP -as shown in the figure is a simple

closed curve and f(z) is analytic inside and on the boundary of C.
Hence by Cauchy’s theorem j f(z) dz=0. f

Since C is the union of the arcs PRSP, PQ, QTUQ and QP, the theorem becomes

Thus J f(z)dz= J f(z) az.

curves Cy Cy Cy Sas C, and if f(z) is analytic in the annular region between C and,

these curves then ;
