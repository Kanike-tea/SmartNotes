(or P) is used to locate the corresponding record in the data file. Figure 17.15 illus-
trates a hash index on the Emp_id field for a file that has been stored as a sequential
file ordered by Name. The Emp_id is hashed to a bucket number by using a hashing
function: the sum of the digits of Emp_id modulo 10. For example, to find Emp_id
51024, the hash function results in bucket number 2; that bucket is accessed first. It
contains the index entry < 51024, Pr >; the pointer Pr leads us to the actual record
in the file. In a practical application, there may be thousands of buckets; the bucket
number, which may be several bits long, would be subjected to the directory
schemes discussed in the context of dynamic hashing in Section 16.8.3. Other
search structures can also be used as indexes.

17.5.2 Bitmap Indexes

The bitmap index is another popular data structure that facilitates querying on
multiple keys. Bitmap indexing is used for relations that contain a large number of
rows. It creates an index for one or more columns, and each value or value range in
