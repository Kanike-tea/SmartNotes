6. Briefly explain the role of DNA in finger printing and forensic science.
Answer:

DNA fingerprinting, also called DNA typing, DNA profiling, genetic fingerprinting,
genotyping, or identity testing, in genetics, method of isolating and identifying variable
elements within the base-pair sequence of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

The procedure for creating a DNA fingerprint consists of first obtaining a sample of cells,
such as skin, hair, or blood cells, which contain DNA. The DNA is extracted from the cells
and purified, the DNA was then cut at specific points along the strand with proteins known as
restriction enzymes. The enzymes produced fragments of varying lengths that were sorted by
placing them on a gel and then subjecting the gel to an electric current (electrophoresis): the
shorter the fragment, the more quickly it moved toward the positive pole (anode).

The sorted double-stranded DNA fragments were then subjected to a blotting technique in
which they were split into single strands and transferred to a nylon sheet. The fragments
underwent autoradiography in which they were exposed to DNA probes—pieces of synthetic
DNA that were made radioactive and that bound to the minisatellites. A piece of X-ray film
was then exposed to the fragments, and a dark mark was produced at any point where a
radioactive probe had become attached. The resultant pattern of marks could then be
analyzed.

The DNA testing process is comprised of four main steps, including extraction,
quantitation, amplification, and capillary electrophoresis.

DNA fingerprinting is a laboratory technique used to determine the probable identity of a
person based on the nucleotide sequences of certain regions of human DNA that are unique to
individuals. Forensic genetic fingerprinting can be defined as the comparison of the DNA
