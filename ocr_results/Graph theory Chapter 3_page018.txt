.2 Sorting

‘Suppose we wish to sort (— rearrange/reorganizé) a given list of n integers in nondecreasing
der. The most common (and the easiest) way of carrying out this sorting consists of two
s, In the first part, we recursively split the given list and all subsequent lists in half (or as
as possible to half) until each sublist contains a single element. In the second part, we
merge the sublists in nondecreasing order until the original n integers have been sorted. The
splitting and merging process is done by the use of balanced complete trees. This method of
01 orting alist is known as Merge Sort.

Me Using the merge-sort method, 'sort the list 7,3, 8)4,5,10,6, 2,9.
