indicating where a cache line was loaded from main memory. There are two common status
bits within the cache: the valid bit and the dirty bit. The valid bit is set when the associated
cache line contains active memory. The dirty bit is active when the cache is using a writeback
policy and new data has been written to cache memory.

The placement of a cache before or after the MMU is either physical or logical. A logical
cache is placed between the processor core and the MMU, and references code and data in
a virtual address space. A physical cache is placed between the MMU and main memory,
and references code and data memory using physical addresses.

A direct-mapped cache isa very simple cache architecture where there is a single location
in cache for a given main memory location. A direct-mapped cache is subject to thrashing.
To reduce thrashing, a cache is divided into smaller equal units called ways. The use of
ways provides multiple storage locations in cache for a single main memory address. These
caches are known as set associative caches.

The core bus architecture helps determine the design of a cached system. A Von
Neumann architecture uses a unified cache to store code and data. A Harvard architecture
uses a split cache: it has one cache for instructions and a separate cache for data.

The cache replacement policy determines which cache line is selected for replacement
ona cache miss. The configured policy defines the algorithm a cache controller uses to select
acache line from the available set in cache memory. The cache line selected for replacement
isa victim. The two replacement policies available in ARM cached cores are pseudorandom
and round-robin.
