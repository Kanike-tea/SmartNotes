Overview of Data
Warehousing and OLAP

D ata warehouses are databases that store and
maintain analytical data separately from transac-
tion-oriented databases for the purpose of decision support. Regular transaction-
oriented databases store data for a limited period of time before the data loses its
immediate usefulness and it is archived. On the other hand, data warehouses tend
to keep years’ worth of data in order to enable analysis of historical data. They
provide storage, functionality, and responsiveness to queries beyond the capabili-
ties of transaction-oriented databases. Accompanying this ever-increasing power
is a great demand to improve the data access performance of databases. In modern
organizations, users of data are often completely removed from the data sources.
Many people only need read-access to data, but still need fast access to a larger
volume of data than can conveniently be downloaded to their desktops. Often
such data comes from multiple databases. Because many of the analyses performed
are recurrent and predictable, software vendors and systems support staff are
designing systems to support these functions. Data warehouses are modeled and
structured differently, they use different types of technologies for storage and
retrieval, and they are used by different types of users than transaction-oriented
databases. Presently there is a great need to provide decision makers from middle
management upward with information at the correct level of detail to support
decision making. Data warehousing, online analytical processing (OLAP), and data
mining provide this functionality. We gave an introduction to data mining tech-
niques in Chapter 28. In this chapter, we give a broad overview of data warehous-
ing and OLAP technologies.
