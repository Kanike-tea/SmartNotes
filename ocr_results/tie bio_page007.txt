9. Define bio diesel. Write an explanatory note on biodiesels.
Answer:

“Biodiesel is a renewable, biodegradable fuel that is manufactured from vegetable oils, and
animal fats.”

Biodiesel is an alternative clean-burning renewable fuel similar to conventional diesel. It is
produced using animal fats, vegetable oils, and waste cooking oil. Due to its biodegradable
nature, it is used as a replacement for fossil diesel fuel. It can also be mixed with petroleum
diesel fuel in any proportion.

Important Features of Biodiesel

Below are certain features of the fuel:

1) Biodegradable and Renewable Fuel.

2) Safer to use and has low toxicity compared to fossil diesel fuel.

3) Lower exhaust emission rate than normal diesel fuel.

4) As per ASTM D 6751 quality parameters, the quality of diesel is analyzed.

5) Using biodiesel doesn’t require any diesel engine modification.

Biodiesel is produced from tallow, vegetable oil or animal fat, and waste oils. There are three
stages of this transformation of oil and fats to biodiesel.

a) Transesterification of the oil in which it is base-catalyzed.

b) The direct acid-catalyzed transesterification

c) Finally conversion of oil to fatty acid and then the formation of biodiesel.

The production of biodiesel involves a chemical reaction. This chemical reaction is known as
transesterification.

Benefits of Biodiesel
Biodiesel has the following benefits:
1) Biodiesel and biodiesel blends are used in almost all diesel engines and vehicles.

2) It is a carbon-neutral liquid, which means that the combustion of biodiesel never produces
the net output of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide like other mineral diesel.

3) In 2007, British Royal Train ran its train with 100% biodiesel fuel.
