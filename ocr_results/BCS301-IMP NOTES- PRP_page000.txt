Random Experiment:
An activity that yield some results called the random experiment. The random variable means a real

number, i.e. X associated with the outcomes of a random experiment.
Definition: Let S be a sample space associated with a random experiment with a real value function defined
and taking its values is called a Random variable.
The random variables are two types. They are,

i) Discrete Random Variables (DRV)

ii) Continuous Random Variables (CRV)

Discrete Random Variables: A Discrete random variable is a variable which can only take a countable
number of values.

For example, if a coin is tossed three times, the number of heads can be obtained is 0, 1, 2 or 3. The
probabilities of each of these probabilities can be tabulated as shown.

S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}

Xx 0 1 2 3
P(x) T 3 3 I
8 8 8 8

Continuous Random variables: A Continuous random variable is a random variable where the data can
take infinitely many values. For example, a random variable measuring the time taken for something to be
done is continuous since there are an infinite number of possible times that can be taken.

Ex: Temperature of the climate, Age of a person, etc.

Probability Mass Function:
Probability mass function is the probability distribution of a discrete random variable and provides the possible
values and their associated probabilities.

1. P(x) > 0

3.0<P(x%) <1

4. Mean p = Yi, xP (xi)

5. Variance a? = Yh, x? P(x;) — uw?
