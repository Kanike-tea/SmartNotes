28.2 Association Rules

28.2.5 Partition Algorithm

Another algorithm, called the partition algorithm,’ is summarized below. If we are
given a database with a small number of potential large itemsets, say, a few thou-
sand, then the support for all of them can be tested in one scan by using a partition-
ing technique. Partitioning divides the database into nonoverlapping subsets; these
are individually considered as separate databases and all large itemsets for that par-
tition, called local frequent itemsets, are generated in one pass. The apriori algo-
rithm can then be used efficiently on each partition if it fits entirely in main
memory. Partitions are chosen in such a way that each partition can be accommo-
dated in main memory. As such, a partition is read only once in each pass. The only
caveat with the partition method is that the minimum support used for each parti-
tion has a slightly different meaning from the original value. The minimum support
is based on the size of the partition rather than the size of the database for deter-
mining local frequent (large) itemsets. The actual support threshold value is the
same as given earlier, but the support is computed only for a partition.

At the end of pass one, we take the union of all frequent itemsets from each parti-
tion. This forms the global candidate frequent itemsets for the entire database.
When these lists are merged, they may contain some false positives. That is, some of
the itemsets that are frequent (large) in one partition may not qualify in several
other partitions and hence may not exceed the minimum support when the original
database is considered. Note that there are no false negatives; no large itemsets will
be missed. The global candidate large itemsets identified in pass one are verified in
pass two; that is, their actual support is measured for the entire database. At the end
of phase two, all global large itemsets are identified. The partition algorithm lends
itself naturally to a parallel or distributed implementation for better efficiency. Fur-
ther improvements to this algorithm have been suggested.*

28.2.6 Other Types of Association Rules

Association Rules among Hierarchies. There are certain types of associations
that are particularly interesting for a special reason. These associations occur among
hierarchies of items. Typically, it is possible to divide items among disjoint hierar-
chies based on the nature of the domain. For example, foods in a supermarket,
items in a department store, or articles in a sports shop can be categorized into
classes and subclasses that give rise to hierarchies. Consider Figure 28.3, which
shows the taxonomy of items in a supermarket. The figure shows two hierarchies—
beverages and desserts, respectively. The entire groups may not produce associa-
tions of the form beverages => desserts, or desserts => beverages. However,
associations of the type Healthy-brand frozen yogurt => bottled water, or Rich
