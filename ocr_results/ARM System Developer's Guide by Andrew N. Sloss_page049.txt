MPUs employ a simple system that uses a limited number of memory regions. These
regions are controlled with a set of special coprocessor registers, and each region is
defined with specific access permissions. This type of memory management is used
for systems that require memory protection but don’t have a complex memory map.
The MPU is explained in Chapter 13.

MMUsare the most comprehensive memory management hardware available on the
ARM. The MMU uses a set of translation tables to provide fine-grained control over
memory. These tables are stored in main memory and provide a virtual-to-physical
address map as well as access permissions. MMUs are designed for more sophisti-
cated platform operating systems that support multitasking. The MMU is explained in
Chapter 14.

2.5.3 COPROCESSORS

Coprocessors can be attached to the ARM processor. A coprocessor extends the processing
features of a core by extending the instruction set or by providing configuration reg-
isters. More than one coprocessor can be added to the ARM core via the coprocessor
interface.

‘The coprocessor can be accessed through a group of dedicated ARM instructions

that provide a load-store type interface. Consider, for example, coprocessor 15: The
ARM processor uses coprocessor 15 registers to control the cache, TCMs, and memory
management.

‘The coprocessor can also extend the instruction set by providing a specialized group

of new instructions. For example, there are a set of specialized instructions that can
