DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED ARRAYS ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
+ When writing programs, sometimes we cannot reliably determine how large an array must
be.
+ A good solution to this problem is to
— defer this decision to run-time &
— allocate the array when we have a good estimate of required array-size

+ Dynamic memory allocation can be performed as follows:

int i,n,*list;
printf ("enter the number of numbers to generate");
scanf ("%d", &n);7
£(n<1)
{
printf ("improper value");
exit (0);
t
MALLOC (list, n*sizeof(int));

* The above code would allocate an array of exactly the required size and hence would not

result in any wastage.

TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
+ These are created by using the concept of array of arrays.
+ A 2-dimensional array is represented as a.1-dimensional array in which each element has a
pointer to a 1-dimensional array as shown below
int x[5][7]; //we create a 1-dimensional array x whose length is 5;
/leach element of x is a 1-dimensional array whose length is 7.

+ Address of x{i][j] = x[i]+)*sizeof(int)

array:

(IT TTTtT)
(LTT)
CITI TI
