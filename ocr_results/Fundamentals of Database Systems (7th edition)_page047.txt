1.6 Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach

1.5 Workers behind the Scene

In addition to those who design, use, and administer a database, others are associ-
ated with the design, development, and operation of the DBMS software and system
environment. These persons are typically not interested in the database content
itself. We call them the workers behind the scene, and they include the following
categories:

= DBMS system designers and implementers design and implement the
DBMS modules and interfaces as a software package. A DBMS is a very
complex software system that consists of many components, or modules,
including modules for implementing the catalog, query language process-
ing, interface processing, accessing and buffering data, controlling concur-
rency, and handling data recovery and security. The DBMS must interface
with other system software, such as the operating system and compilers for
various programming languages.

= Tool developers design and implement tools—the software packages that
facilitate database modeling and design, database system design, and
improved performance. Tools are optional packages that are often pur-
chased separately. They include packages for database design, performance
monitoring, natural language or graphical interfaces, prototyping, simula-
tion, and test data generation. In many cases, independent software vendors
develop and market these tools.

= Operators and maintenance personnel (system administration personnel)
are responsible for the actual running and maintenance of the hardware and
software environment for the database system.

Although these categories of workers behind the scene are instrumental in making
the database system available to end users, they typically do not use the database
contents for their own purposes.

1.6 Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach

In this section we discuss some additional advantages of using a DBMS and the
capabilities that a good DBMS should possess. These capabilities are in addition to
the four main characteristics discussed in Section 1.3. The DBA must utilize these
capabilities to accomplish a variety of objectives related to the design, administra-
tion, and use of a large multiuser database.

1.6.1 Controlling Redundancy

In traditional software development utilizing file processing, every user group
maintains its own files for handling its data-processing applications. For example,
consider the UNIVERSITY database example of Section 1.2; here, two groups of
users might be the course registration personnel and the accounting office. In the
traditional approach, each group independently keeps files on students. The
