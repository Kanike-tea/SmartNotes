1.3.2 Specification of Views in SQL

In SQL, the command to specify a view is CREATE VIEW. The view is given a (virtual) table name
(or view name), a list of attribute names, and a query to specify the contents of the view. If none of
the view attributes results from applying functions or arithmetic operations, we do not have to
specify new attribute names for the view, since they would be the same as the names of the
attributes of the defining tables in the default case.

Example 1:

CREATE VIEW WORKS_ON1
AS SELECT Fname, Lname, Pname, Hours
FROM EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON
WHERE Ssn=Essn AND Pno=Pnumber;
Example 2:
CREATE VIEW DEPT_INFO(Dept_name, No_of_emps, Total_sal)
AS SELECT Dname, COUNT (*), SUM (Salary)
FROM DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dnumber=Dno
GROUP BY Dname;

In example 1, we did not specify any new attribute names for the view WORKS_ON1. In this
case,WORKS_ON1 inherits the names of the view attributes from the defining tables EMPLOYEE,
PROJECT, and WORKS_ON.

Example 2 explicitly specifies new attribute names for the view DEPT_INFO, using a one-to-one
correspondence between the attributes specified in the CREATE VIEW clause and those specified
in the SELECT clause of the query that defines the view.

WORKS.ON1
Fname Lname Pname Hours

DEPT_INFO
Dept_name | No_of_emps Total_sal

We can now specify SQL queries on a view—or virtual table—in the same way we specify queries
involving base tables.

For example, to retrieve the last name and first name of all employees who work on the ‘ProductX’
project, we can utilize the WORKS_ON1 view and specify the query as :
