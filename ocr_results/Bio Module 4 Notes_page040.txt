FCs typically require specialized administration techniques, such as emulsification or
encapsulation, to enhance their stability and improve their oxygen-carrying capacity. These
techniques can add complexity and cost to the administration process.

Short half-life:

PFCs have a relatively short half-life in the body, leading to the need for frequent
administration to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity. This can be impractical in
certain clinical scenarios or situations where prolonged oxygen delivery is required.

Clearance and elimination:

PFCs are primarily eliminated from the body through the lungs, and their elimination
kinetics can vary among individuals. This can impact their effectiveness and clearance rates,
potentially limiting their duration of action.

Side effects and toxicity:

PFCs have the potential for side effects and toxicity, particularly if used in excessive
amounts or for prolonged periods. Adverse effects can include respiratory distress, immune
reactions, and potential organ toxicity. The safety profile of PFCs needs to be thoroughly
studied and monitored.

Regulatory considerations:

PFCs are subject to regulatory approval and scrutiny, similar to other medical products.
Obtaining regulatory approval for PFC-based products can involve extensive testing and
evaluation to ensure their safety and efficacy.

Examples of PFCs

e  Perftoran: Perftoran is a PFC that was developed in Russia and is used in several countries,
including Russia, Ukraine, and China. It has been used in the treatment of a variety of
conditions, including trauma, heart attack, and stroke.

e Oxycyte: Oxycyte is a PFC that is being developed by Oxygen Biotherapeutics. It is currently
in clinical trials and has shown promise in increasing oxygen delivery to tissues in patients with
traumatic brain injury.

e Oxycyte PFC Emulsion: This is another PFC-based blood substitute being developed by Oxygen
Biotherapeutics. It is designed to be used as an oxygen carrier during surgery and other medical
procedures.

e Hemopure-PFC: Hemopure-PFC is a hybrid blood substitute that combines a PFC with a
hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier. It is being developed by HbO2 Therapeutics and has shown
promise in increasing oxygen delivery to tissues in preclinical studies.

It's important to note that while these technologies show promise, they are still in
development and further studies are needed to evaluate their safety and effectiveness.
