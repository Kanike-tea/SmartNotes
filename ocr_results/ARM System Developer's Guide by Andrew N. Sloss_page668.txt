D.4 STRONGARM1 INSTRUCTION CYCLE TIMINGS

Table D.7

‘The StrongARMI coreis based on five-stage pipeline. There is usually a one-cycle delay fol-
lowing a load or multiply instruction before you can use the data. Additionally, there is often
a one-cycle delay if you start a new multiply instruction immediately following a previous
multiply instruction. The multiplier circuit uses a 32-bit by 12-bit multiplier array with early
termination. The number of multiply iteration cycles M depends on the value of register Rs
according to Table D.7. Table D.8 gives the StrongARM] instruction cycle timings.
