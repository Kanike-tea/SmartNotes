elements are not shown here. The global query compiler references the global
conceptual schema from the global system catalog to verify and impose defined
constraints. The global query optimizer references both global and local conceptual
schemas and generates optimized local queries from global queries. It evaluates all
candidate strategies using a cost function that estimates cost based on response
time (CPU, I/O, and network latencies) and estimated sizes of intermediate results.
The latter is particularly important in queries involving joins. Having computed the
cost for each candidate, the optimizer selects the candidate with the minimum cost
for execution. Each local DBMS would have its local query optimizer, transaction
manager, and execution engines as well as the local system catalog, which houses the
local schemas. The global transaction manager is responsible for coordinating the
execution across multiple sites in conjunction with the local transaction manager at
those sites.

23.7.3 Federated Database Schema Architecture

Typical five-level schema architecture to support global applications in the FDBS
environment is shown in Figure 23.9. In this architecture, the local schema is the
