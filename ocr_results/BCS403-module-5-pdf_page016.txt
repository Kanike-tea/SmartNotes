the row header on the same item X, then T_ can obtain the lock because the locking

modes are compatible

(a) Read Write
Read Yes No
Write No No
(b) Read Write Certify
Read Yes Yes No
Write Yes No No
Certify No No No

Figure 22.6: Lock compatibility tables. (a) A compatibility table for read/write locking scheme.
(b) A compatibility table for read/write/certify locking scheme.

= On the other hand, an-entry of No in the table indicates that the locks are not compatible,
so T must wait until T releases the lock

= The idea behind multiversion 2PL is to allow other transactions T to read an item X
while a single transaction, T holds a write lock on X

= This is accomplished by allowing two versions for each item X; one version must always
have been written by some committed transaction

= The second version X is created when a transaction T acquires a write lock on the item

5.15Validation (Optimistic) Concurrency Control Techniques
= In optimistic concurrency control techniques, also known as validation or
certification techniques, no checking is done while the transaction is executing
= In this scheme, updates in the transaction are not applied directly to the database items

until the transaction reaches its end
