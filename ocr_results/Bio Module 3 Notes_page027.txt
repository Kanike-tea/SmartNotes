Figure: Representing the parts of nephron
The nephron is comprised of several key structures:

e Bowman's capsule: This is a cup-shaped structure that surrounds the glomerulus and
filters waste and excess fluid from the bloodstream into the renal tubule.

e Glomerulus: A network of tiny blood vessels within the Bowman's capsule that filters
waste and excess fluid from the bloodstream.

e Proximal convoluted tubule: A segment of the renal tubule that reabsorbs important
substances, such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, back into the bloodstream.

e Loop of Henle: A U-shaped segment of the renal tubule that is critical for the
reabsorption of ions and water.

e Distal convoluted tubule: A segment of the renal tubule that regulates the levels of
electrolytes and other important substances in the bloodstream.

¢ Collecting duct: A series of ducts that collect the filtrate from the renal tubules and transport
it to the renal pelvis, where it drains into the ureter and eventually into the bladder.

The nephrons are surrounded by a network of blood vessels, including the afferent arteriole
and the efferent arteriole, which bring blood into and out of the glomerulus, respectively. The
filtrate produced by the nephron passes through the renal tubules, where it is modified by
reabsorption and secretion, before being eliminated from the body as urine.
