30.7 Encryption and Public Key Infrastructures

The major liability associated with secret-key algorithms is the need for sharing the
secret key. A possible method is to derive the secret key from a user-supplied password
string by applying the same function to the string at both the sender and receiver; this
is known as a password-based encryption algorithm. The strength of the symmetric key
encryption depends on the size of the key used. For the same algorithm, encrypting
using a longer key is tougher to break than the one using a shorter key.

30.7.3 Public (Asymmetric) Key Encryption

In 1976, Diffie and Hellman proposed a new kind of cryptosystem, which they
called public key encryption. Public key algorithms are based on mathematical
functions rather than operations on bit patterns. They address one drawback of
symmetric key encryption, namely that both sender and recipient must exchange
the common key in a secure manner. In public key systems, two keys are used for
encryption/decryption. The public key can be transmitted in a nonsecure way,
whereas the private key is not transmitted at all. These algorithms—which use two
related keys, a public key and a private key, to perform complementary operations
(encryption and decryption)—are known as asymmetric key encryption
algorithms. The use of two keys can have profound consequences in the areas of
confidentiality, key distribution, and authentication. The two keys used for public
key encryption are referred to as the public key and the private key. The private key
is kept secret, but it is referred to as a private key rather than a secret key (the key
used in conventional encryption) to avoid confusion with conventional encryption.
The two keys are mathematically related, since one of the keys is used to perform
encryption and the other to perform decryption. However, it is very difficult to
derive the private key from the public key.

A public key encryption scheme, or infrastructure, has six ingredients:

1. Plaintext. This is the data or readable message that is fed into the algorithm
as input.

2. Encryption algorithm. This algorithm performs various transformations
on the plaintext.

3. and 4. Public and private keys. These are a pair of keys that have been
selected so that if one is used for encryption, the other is used for decryp-
tion. The exact transformations performed by the encryption algorithm
depend on the public or private key that is provided as input. For example, if
a message is encrypted using the public key, it can only be decrypted using
the private key.

5. Ciphertext. This is the scrambled message produced as output. It depends
on the plaintext and the key. For a given message, two different keys will
produce two different ciphertexts.

6. Decryption algorithm. This algorithm accepts the ciphertext and the
matching key and produces the original plaintext.

As the name suggests, the public key of the pair is made public for others to use,
whereas the private key is known only to its owner. A general-purpose public key
