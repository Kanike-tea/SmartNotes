(4) A single vertex in a graph G is a subgraph of G,
/ (5) A single edge in a graph G, together with its end vertices, is a subgraph of G

Spanning Subgraph

Given a graph G = (V, E), if there is a subgraph G; = (Vi, £1) of G such that V; = V, then
G, is called a spanning subgraph of G.

In other words, a subgraph G; of a graph G is a spanning subgraph of G whenever Gy
contains all vertices of G. Thus, a graph and all its spanning subgraphs have the same vertex
set. Obviously, every graph is its own spanning subgraph.

For example, for the graph shown in Figure 1.69(a), the graph shown in Figure 1.69(b) is a
spanning subgraph whereas the graph shown in Figure 1.69(c) is a subgraph but not a spanning

subgraph.
