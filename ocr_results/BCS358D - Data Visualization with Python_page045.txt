PROGRAM EXPLANATION
The below program demonstrates the usage of the difflib module to calculate the string similarity

between two given strings. Let's go through the program step by step:

1. The program begins by importing the difflib module, which provides various functions

and classes for comparing sequences.

2. The string_similarity function is defined, which takes two strings (str1 and str2) as input.
Inside the function, a SequenceMatcher object is created by passing the two input strings
as arguments, with their lowercase versions (str1 .lower() and str2.lower()). This is done

to make the comparison case-insensitive.

3. The ratio() method is called on the SequenceMatcher object, which returns the similarity

ratio between the two strings as a float value.

4. The program then proceeds to test the function. Two pairs of strings are provided for

comparison:

a. The first pair consists of the same string: 'Python Exercises'. The original strings
are printed, followed by the calculated similarity ratio between them. Since both
strings are identical, the similarity ratio is expected to be 1.0.
b. The second pair consists of slightly different strings: 'Python Exercises’ and
‘Python Exercise’. Again, the original strings are printed, followed by the
calculated similarity ratio. In this case, the similarity ratio is expected to be
slightly less than 1.0, reflecting the difference between the two strings.
The difflib.SequenceMatcher class in difflib module provides a flexible and customizable way to
compare sequences, including strings. By adjusting the parameters or using different methods of

the SequenceMatcher class, you can perform more specific types of string matching and
