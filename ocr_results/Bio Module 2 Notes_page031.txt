Firstly, the enzyme accelerates the reaction by lowering the activation energy and remains
intact at the end of the reaction by acting as a catalyst. Secondly, enzymes operate under a
milder condition. Enzymes can be used in catalytic concentrations at low temperatures and at
pH-values near to neutral. Thirdly, enzymes are the best alternative to toxic, hazardous, and
polluting chemicals. Fourthly, enzymes act only on specific substrates, for example, enzymes
used in desizing do not affect cellulose hence there is no loss of strength of cotton. Fifthly,

enzymes are easy to control because their activity depends upon optimum condition. Sixthly,

enzymes are biodegradable. At the end of the reaction in which enzymes used we can simply
drain the remaining solution because enzymes are biodegradable and do not produce toxic

waste on degradation hence there is no pollution.

Enzymes used in textile processing

Enzymatic desizing

Amylases are used to remove starch-based size for improved and uniform wet processing in
the textile industry. An amylase enzyme can be used for desizing processes at low-temperature
(30-60°C) and optimum pH is 5.5-6.5. The advantage of these enzymes is that they are specific

for starch, removing it without damaging to the support fabric.

Enzymatic Scouring

Scouring is the removal of non-cellulosic material present on the surface of the cotton. In
generally cellulase and pectinase are combined and used for Bioscouring. In this pectinase
destroy the cotton cuticle structure by digesting the pectin and removing the connection
between the cuticle and the body of cotton fiber whereas cellulase can destroy cuticle structure

by digesting the primary wall cellulose immediately under the cuticle of cotton.

Enzymatic Bleaching

The purpose of cotton bleaching is to decolorize natural pigments and to confer a pure white
appearance to the fibers. Mainly flavonoids are responsible for the color of cotton. The most
common industrial bleaching agent is hydrogen peroxide. Conventional preparation of cotton
requires high amounts of alkaline chemicals and consequently, huge quantities of rinse water
are generated. However, radical reactions of bleaching agents with the fiber can lead to a
decrease in the degree of polymerization and, thus, to severe damage. Therefore, replacement
of hydrogen peroxide by an enzymatic bleaching system would not only lead to better product
quality due to less fiber damage but also to substantial savings on washing water needed for

the removal of hydrogen peroxide. An alternative to this process is to use a combination of
