Header Linked List

A header linked list is a linked list which always contains a special NODE, called the header NODE,
at the beginning of the list. There are two types of header list.

1. A grounded header list: Last NODE contains the null pointer.
2. Circular header list: Last NODE points back to the header NODE.

Note: Unless stated it is assumed that the linked list is circular header list.

Polynomials Polynomial
Representation

We should be able to represent any number of different polynomials as long as memory is available.

In general, A polynomial is represented as :

A(X)= Am-1X™! + cece aox’
where the aj are nonzero coefficients and the e' are nonnegative integer exponents such that
em-1 >eM-2 >... > el > e020.

We represent each term as a NODE containing coefficient and exponent fields, as well as a pointer
to the next term. Assuming that the coefficients are integers, the type declarations are:

struct polyNode {int coef;
