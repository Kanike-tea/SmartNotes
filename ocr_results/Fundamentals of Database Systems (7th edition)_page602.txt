Table 16.3 Average Access Times for a File of b Blocks under Basic File Organizations

Average Blocks to Access

Type of Organization Access/Search Method a Specific Record
Heap (unordered) Sequential scan (linear search) b/2
Ordered Sequential scan b/2
Ordered Binary search log, b

This further improves the random access time on the ordering key field. (We dis-
cuss indexes in Chapter 17.) If the ordering attribute is not a key, the file is called a
clustered file.

16.8 Hashing Techniques

Another type of primary file organization is based on hashing, which provides very
fast access to records under certain search conditions. This organization is usually
called a hash file.'* The search condition must be an equality condition on a single
field, called the hash field. In most cases, the hash field is also a key field of the file,
in which case it is called the hash key. The idea behind hashing is to provide a func-
tion h, called a hash function or randomizing function, which is applied to the
hash field value of a record and yields the address of the disk block in which the
record is stored. A search for the record within the block can be carried out in a
main memory buffer. For most records, we need only a single-block access to
retrieve that record.

Hashing is also used as an internal search structure within a program whenever
a group of records is accessed exclusively by using the value of one field. We
describe the use of hashing for internal files in Section 16.8.1; then we show
how it is modified to store external files on disk in Section 16.8.2. In Sec-
tion 16.8.3 we discuss techniques for extending hashing to dynamically growing
files.

16.8.1 Internal Hashing

For internal files, hashing is typically implemented as a hash table through the use
of an array of records. Suppose that the array index range is from 0 to M - 1, as
shown in Figure 16.8(a); then we have M slots whose addresses correspond to the
array indexes. We choose a hash function that transforms the hash field value into
an integer between 0 and M — 1. One common hash function is the h(K) = K mod
M function, which returns the remainder of an integer hash field value K after divi-
sion by M; this value is then used for the record address.

184 hash file has also been called a direct file.
