Searching for relevant documents from the inverted index, given a set of query

terms, is generally a three-step process.

1. Vocabulary search. If the query comprises multiple terms, they are sepa-
rated and treated as independent terms. Each term is searched in the vocab-
ulary. Various data structures, like variations of B*-tree or hashing, may be
used to optimize the search process. Query terms may also be ordered in
lexicographic order to improve space efficiency.

2. Document information retrieval. The document information for each
term is retrieved.

3. Manipulation of retrieved information. The document information vector
for each term obtained in step 2 is now processed further to incorporate
various forms of query logic. Various kinds of queries like prefix, range,
context, and proximity queries are processed in this step to construct the

final result based on the document collections returned in step 2.
