4.1 ARM Bus Technology
Embedded systems use different bus technologies than those designed for x86 PCs.

The most common PC bus technology, the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus,

connects such devices as video cards and hard disk controllers to the x86 processor bus.

This type of technology is external or off-chip (i.c., the bus is designed to connect
mechanically and electrically to devices external to the chip) and is built into the motherboard
of a PC.

In contrast, embedded devices use an on-chip bus that is internal to the chip and that allows

different peripheral devices to be interconnected with an ARM core.
There are two different classes of devices attached to the bus.

Bus master: It is a logical device capable of initiating a data transfer with another

device across the same bus.

Bus slaves: Logical devices capable only of responding to a transfer request from a

bus master device.
A bus has two architecture levels.

The first is a physical level that covers the electrical characteristics and bus width (16,
32, or 64 bits).

The second level deals with protocol—the logical rules that govern the

communication between the processor and a peripheral.

4.2 AMBA Bus Protocol

The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) was introduced in 1996 and has

been widely adopted as the on-chip bus architecture used for ARM processors.

The first AMBA buses introduced were the ARM System Bus (ASB) and the ARM
Peripheral Bus (APB). Later ARM introduced another bus design, called the ARM High
Performance Bus (AHB).
