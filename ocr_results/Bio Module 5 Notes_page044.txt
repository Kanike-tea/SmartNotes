Functionality: DNA origami structures can be functionalized with additional molecules or
materials, such as proteins, nanoparticles, or other materials, which makes them useful for a
variety of applications.

Biocompatibility: DNA is a naturally occurring molecule, which makes it biocompatible and
less likely to cause an immune response. This makes DNA origami a promising tool for
biomedical applications, such as drug delivery.

Limitations of DNA Origami

Complexity: Creating complex DNA origami structures can be challenging and time-
consuming, and requires specialized knowledge and expertise.

Cost: The cost of producing and synthesizing the DNA required for DNA origami can be
high, making it an expensive technique.

Stability: DNA origami structures are relatively fragile and can be degraded by enzymes or
other factors, which can limit their stability and shelf-life.

Scalability: The scalability of DNA origami remains a challenge, as producing large
quantities of complex DNA origami structures is difficult and expensive.

5.2 Bio-computing

Bio-computing refers to the use of biological systems, such as cells, enzymes, and DNA,

for computing and information processing. This field combines the principles of computer

science, biology, and engineering to create novel systems for computing and data storage.

Technological Importance

The technological importance of bio-computing lies in its potential to provide new and

innovative solutions for computing and information processing. Here are some of the key ways

in which bio-computing can impact technology:

Computational power: Bio-computing systems have the potential to provide new levels of
computational power, as they can perform complex tasks and calculations using biological
processes.

Data storage: Bio-computing systems can be used to store and process large amounts of
data, as DNA has a high information density [consider that a single gram of DNA can
theoretically store up to 215 petabytes (1 petabyte = 1 million gigabytes) of data] and can be
easily synthesized and amplified.

Medical applications: Bio-computing systems can be used to develop new diagnostic and
therapeutic approaches in medicine, such as biosensors and gene therapies.

Environmental monitoring: Bio-computing systems can be used to monitor and track
environmental conditions, such as air and water quality, in real-time.
