Chapter 30 Database Security

The second level of privileges applies to the relation level, which includes base rela-
tions and virtual (view) relations. These privileges are defined for SQL2. In the fol-
lowing discussion, the term relation may refer either to a base relation or to a view,
unless we explicitly specify one or the other. Privileges at the relation level specify
for each user the individual relations on which each type of command can be
applied. Some privileges also refer to individual columns (attributes) of relations.
SQL2 commands provide privileges at the relation and attribute level only. Although
this distinction is general, it makes it difficult to create accounts with limited privi-
leges. The granting and revoking of privileges generally follow an authorization
model for discretionary privileges known as the access matrix model, where the
rows of a matrix M represent subjects (users, accounts, programs) and the columns
represent objects (relations, records, columns, views, operations). Each position
M(i, j) in the matrix represents the types of privileges (read, write, update) that sub-
ject i holds on object j.

To control the granting and revoking of relation privileges, each relation R in a
database is assigned an owner account, which is typically the account that was used
when the relation was created in the first place. The owner of a relation is given all
privileges on that relation. In SQL2, the DBA can assign an owner to a whole
schema by creating the schema and associating the appropriate authorization iden-
tifier with that schema, using the CREATE SCHEMA command (see Section 7.1.1).
The owner account holder can pass privileges on any of the owned relations to
other users by granting privileges to their accounts. In SQL, the following types of
privileges can be granted on each individual relation R:

= SELECT (retrieval or read) privilege on R. Gives the account retrieval privi-
lege. In SQL, this gives the account the privilege to use the SELECT state-
ment to retrieve tuples from R.

= Modification privileges on R. This gives the account the capability to mod-
ify the tuples of R. In SQL, this includes three privileges: UPDATE, DELETE,
and INSERT. These correspond to the three SQL commands (see Sec-
tion 7.4) for modifying a table R. Additionally, both the INSERT and UPDATE
privileges can specify that only certain attributes of R can be modified by the
account.

= References privilege on R. This gives the account the capability to reference
(or refer to) a relation R when specifying integrity constraints. This privilege
can also be restricted to specific attributes of R.

Notice that to create a view, the account must have the SELECT privilege on all rela-
tions involved in the view definition in order to specify the query that corresponds
to the view.

30.2.2 Specifying Privileges through the Use of Views

The mechanism of views is an important discretionary authorization mechanism in
its own right. For example, if the owner A of a relation R wants another account B
to be able to retrieve only some fields of R, then A can create a view V of R that
