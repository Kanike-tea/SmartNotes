would also present a problem. Hence, relations in these two databases that
have identical names—CUSTOMER or ACCOUNT—may have some common
and some entirely distinct information.

= Representation and naming. The representation and naming of data ele-
ments and the structure of the data model may be prespecified for each local
database.

= The understanding, meaning, and subjective interpretation of data. This
is a chief contributor to semantic heterogeneity.

= Transaction and policy constraints. These deal with serializability criteria,
compensating transactions, and other transaction policies.

= Derivation of summaries. Aggregation, summarization, and other data-
processing features and operations supported by the system.

The above problems related to semantic heterogeneity are being faced by all major
multinational and governmental organizations in all application areas. In today’s
commercial environment, most enterprises are resorting to heterogeneous FDBSs,
having heavily invested in the development of individual database systems using
diverse data models on different platforms over the last 20 to 30 years. Enterprises
are using various forms of software—typically called the middleware; or Web-
based packages called application servers (for example, WebLogic or WebSphere);
and even generic systems, called enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (for
example, SAP, J. D. Edwards ERP)—to manage the transport of queries and trans-
actions from the global application to individual databases (with possible additional
processing for business rules) and the data from the heterogeneous database servers
to the global application. Detailed discussion of these types of software systems is
outside the scope of this text.

Just as providing the ultimate transparency is the goal of any distributed database
architecture, local component databases strive to preserve autonomy.
Communication autonomy of a component DBS refers to its ability to decide
whether to communicate with another component DBS. Execution autonomy
refers to the ability of a component DBS to execute local operations without inter-
ference from external operations by other component DBSs and its ability to decide
the order in which to execute them. The association autonomy of a component
DBS implies that it has the ability to decide whether and how much to share its
functionality (operations it supports) and resources (data it manages) with other
component DBSs. The major challenge of designing FDBSs is to let component
DBSs interoperate while still providing the above types of autonomies to them.

23.7 Distributed Database Architectures

In this section, we first briefly point out the distinction between parallel and distrib-
uted database architectures. Although both are prevalent in industry today, there are
various manifestations of the distributed architectures that are continuously evolv-
ing among large enterprises. The parallel architecture is more common in high-per-
