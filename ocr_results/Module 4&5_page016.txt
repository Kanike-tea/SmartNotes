Microcontrollers - BCS402

The code first initializes the IRQ stack. For safety reasons, it is always best to make sure that

interrupts are disabled by using a bitwise OR between NolInt and the new mode.

Each mode stack must be set up. Here is an example of how to set up three different stacks when
the processor core comes out of reset. Note that, since this is a basic example, we do not

implement a stack for the abort,

FIQ, and undefined instruction modes. If these stacks are required, then very similar code is

used.
