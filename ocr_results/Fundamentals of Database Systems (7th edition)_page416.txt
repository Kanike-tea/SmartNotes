Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases

12.2.6 Specifying Relationships via Reference

A component attribute of one tuple may be a reference (specified using the key-
word REF) to a tuple of another (or possibly the same) table. An example is shown
in Figure 12.4(e).

The keyword SCOPE specifies the name of the table whose tuples can be referenced
by the reference attribute. Notice that this is similar to a foreign key, except that the
system-generated OID value is used rather than the primary key value.

SQL uses a dot notation to build path expressions that refer to the component
attributes of tuples and row types. However, for an attribute whose type is REF, the
dereferencing symbol —> is used. For example, the query below retrieves employees
working in the company named ‘ABCXYZ’ by querying the EMPLOYMENT table:

SELECT —_ E.Employee->NAME
FROM EMPLOYMENT AS E
WHERE E.Company->COMP_NAME = ‘ABCXYZ’;

In SQL, -> is used for dereferencing and has the same meaning assigned to it in the
C programming language. Thus, if r is a reference to a tuple (object) and a is a com-
ponent attribute in that tuple, then r -> a is the value of attribute a in that tuple.

If several relations of the same type exist, SQL provides the SCOPE keyword by
which a reference attribute may be made to point to a tuple within a specific table of
that type.

12.3 The ODMG Object Model and the Object
Definition Language ODL

As we discussed in the introduction to Chapter 6, one of the reasons for the success
of commercial relational DBMSs is the SQL standard. The lack of a standard for
ODBs for several years may have caused some potential users to shy away from con-
verting to this new technology. Subsequently, a consortium of ODB vendors and
users, called ODMG (Object Data Management Group), proposed a standard that is
known as the ODMG-93 or ODMG 1.0 standard. This was revised into ODMG 2.0,
and later to ODMG 3.0. The standard is made up of several parts, including the
object model, the object definition language (ODL), the object query language
(OQL), and the bindings to object-oriented programming languages.

In this section, we describe the ODMG object model and the ODL. In Section 12.4,
we discuss how to design an ODB from an EER conceptual schema. We will give an
overview of OQL in Section 12.5, and the C++ language binding in Section 12.6.
Examples of how to use ODL, OQL, and the C++ language binding will use the
UNIVERSITY database example introduced in Chapter 4. In our description, we will
follow the ODMG 3.0 object model as described in Cattell et al. (2000).17 It is

'7The earlier versions of the object model were published in 1993 and 1997.
