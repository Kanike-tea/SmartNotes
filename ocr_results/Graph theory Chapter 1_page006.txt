1.1. Directed Graphs 9

Let k be the number of vertices with odd in-degrees. Then n — k number of vertices have
even in-degrees. Without loss of generality, let us take V}, V2,-.. Vg to be the vertices with odd

in-degrees and Ve+1, Ve42,...Vp_ to be the vertices with even in-degrees. Then, expression (ii)
may be rewritten as

k n
Dow + Yr wy=m (iii)
i=l isk+1

Now, the second sum on the left hand side of this expression is even. Also, m is odd.
Therefore, the first sum must be odd. That is

d (vy) + d-(v2) + +++ +d" (vy) = odd (iv)

But, each of d~(v;), d~(v2),...d7(vg) is odd. Therefore, the number ai in the left
a

hand side of (iv) must be odd. That is, k is odd. This proves the required result.

Exercises

2. For the digraph shown in Figure 1.6, determine the out-degrees and in-degrees of all the vertices.
3. For the digraphs of Exercise 1 above, determine the out-degrees and in-degrees of all the vertices.
4. Let D be the digraph whose vertex set is V = {v), v2, v3, v4, vs} and the directed edge set is

E = ((v1, v4), (V2, v3); (V3, 5), (v4, V2), (Vas V4), (V4, ¥5), (vss v1)}-

Write down a diagram of D and indicate the out-degrees and in-degrees of all the vertices.
