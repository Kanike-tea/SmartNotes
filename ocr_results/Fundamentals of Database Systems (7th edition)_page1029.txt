content. These systems use image-processing and statistical-modeling techniques
to analyze image content to generate accurate annotation tags that can then be used
to retrieve images by content. Since different annotation schemes will use different
vocabularies to annotate images, the quality of image retrieval will be poor. To solve
this problem, recent research techniques have proposed the use of concept hierar-
chies, taxonomies, or ontologies using OWL (Web Ontology Language), in which
terms and their relationships are clearly defined. These can be used to infer higher-
level concepts based on tags. Concepts like “sky” and “grass” may be further divided
into “clear sky” and “cloudy sky” or “dry grass” and “green grass” in such a taxon-
omy. These approaches generally come under semantic tagging and can be used in
conjunction with the above feature-analysis and object-identification strategies.

26.4.4 Analysis of Audio Data Sources

Audio sources are broadly classified into speech, music, and other audio data. Each
of these is significantly different from the others; hence different types of audio data
are treated differently. Audio data must be digitized before it can be processed and
stored. Indexing and retrieval of audio data is arguably the toughest among all types
of media, because like video, it is continuous in time and does not have easily mea-
surable characteristics such as text. Clarity of sound recordings is easy to perceive
humanly but is hard to quantify for machine learning. Interestingly, speech data
often uses speech recognition techniques to aid the actual audio content, as this can
make indexing this data a lot easier and more accurate. This is sometimes referred
to as text-based indexing of audio data. The speech metadata is typically content
dependent, in that the metadata is generated from the audio content; for example,
the length of the speech, the number of speakers, and so on. However, some of the
metadata might be independent of the actual content, such as the length of the
speech and the format in which the data is stored. Music indexing, on the other
hand, is done based on the statistical analysis of the audio signal, also known as
content-based indexing. Content-based indexing often makes use of the key features
of sound: intensity, pitch, timbre, and rhythm. It is possible to compare different
pieces of audio data and retrieve information from them based on the calculation of
certain features, as well as application of certain transforms.

26.5 Introduction to Deductive Databases

26.5.1 Overview of Deductive Databases

In a deductive database system we typically specify rules through a declarative
language—a language in which we specify what to achieve rather than how to
achieve it. An inference engine (or deduction mechanism) within the system can
deduce new facts from the database by interpreting these rules. The model used for
deductive databases is closely related to the relational data model, and particularly
to the domain relational calculus formalism (see Section 6.6). It is also related to the
field of logic programming and the Prolog language. The deductive database work
