are restricted to 1.1, 1.2, ... , 1.9, and 2.0 acres. In such a situation we would have the
additional functional dependency FDS: Area > County_name. If we add this to the other
dependencies, the relation schema LOTS1A still is in 3NF because this f.d. conforms to
clause (b) in the general definition of 3NF, County_name being a prime attribute.

The area of a lot that determines the county, as specified by FD5, can be represented
by 16 tuples in a separate relation R(Area, County_name), since there are only 16 pos-
sible Area values (see Figure 14.13). This representation reduces the redundancy of
repeating the same information in the thousands of LOTS1A tuples. BCNF is a
stronger normal form that would disallow LOTS1A and suggest the need for decom-
posing it.

Definition. A relation schema R is in BCNF if whenever a nontrivial functional

dependency X > A holds in R, then X is a superkey of R.

The formal definition of BCNF differs from the definition of 3NF in that clause (b)
of 3NF, which allows f.d.’s having the RHS as a prime attribute, is absent from
BCNF. That makes BCNF a stronger normal form compared to 3NF. In our exam-
ple, FD5 violates BCNF in LOTS1A because Area is not a superkey of LOTS1A. We
can decompose LOTS1A into two BCNF relations LOTS1AX and LOTS1AY, shown
in Figure 14.13(a). This decomposition loses the functional dependency FD2
because its attributes no longer coexist in the same relation after decomposition.

In practice, most relation schemas that are in 3NF are also in BCNF. Only if there
exists some f.d. X > A that holds in a relation schema R with X not being a superkey
