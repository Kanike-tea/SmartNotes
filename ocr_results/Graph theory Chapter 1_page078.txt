Then from the assumption made in the Preceding paragraph we have m, 2 &—-1. Consequently,
m+ > (k+lj-1,

But, mg + 1 is the number of edges in Gy, and & +1 is the number of vertices in Gy}.
Thus, the result m 2 n-1 holds forn = k+1 when it holds for n = & = 2. Hence, by induction,
the result holds for all integers n > 2. This completes the proof. °

Theorem 4 «A graph G is disconnected if and only if its vertex set V can be partitioned into

two non-empty disjoint subsets V, and V2 such that there exists no edge in G whose one end
verex is in Vj and the other is in V>, :

Proof: First, suppose that G is a disconnected graph. Consider a vertex v in G. Let V; be the
set of all vertices in G that are connected to v. Since G is disconnected, V; does not include all
vertices of G, This means that V; is a proper subset of V. Let V2.= V— V,. Then V;N V2 = ®,
V = V, U V2 and no vertex in V; is connected to any vertex in V2. Hence, V; and Vz forma
partition of V of the desired type.

Conversely, suppose two subsets V; and V2 of V form a partition of V of the desired type.
Consider two arbitrary vertices v and u in G, such that v € V; and u € V>. Then there exists no
path between v and u. Hence G is not connected.

This completes the proof of the theorem. °

eum Let G be a graph with n vertices where n is even and > 2. If the degree of every
vertex in G is 4(n — 2), disprove that G is connected.
> Consider the disconnected graph shown below:

In this graph the number of vertices is n = 6 which is even and greater than 2, and the

feree of every vertex is 2 = (6 - 2)/2.= (n - 2)/2.
_ Thus, the graph considered meets the given conditions and is disconnected. This counter
