Contiguous memory allocation (calloc)
e This function is used to allocate contiguous block of memory. It is primarily used to allocate
memory for arrays.
e The function calloc() allocates a user specified amount of memory and initializes the allocated
memory to 0.
A pointer to the start of the allocated memory is returned.
In case there is insufficient memory it returns NULL

syntax: void * calloc (size_t count , size_t size);

Example: To allocate a one dimensional array of integers whose capacity is n the following code can
be written.

int *ptr

ptr=(int*)calloc(n,sizeof(int))

Reallocationlof memory(@eall6e): The function realloc resizes the memory previously allocated by
either malloc or calloc.

syntax: Void * realloc (void * ptr , size_t new_size);

The statement realloc(p,s) -- Changes the size of the memory pointed by p to s. The existing contents
of the block remain unchanged.

When s> oldsize(Block size increases) the additional (s — oldsize )have unspecified value
When s<oddsize (Block size reduces) the rightmost (oldsize-s) bytes of the old block are freed.
When realloc is able to do the resizing it returns a pointer to the start of the new block

When is not able to do the resizing the old block is unchanged and the function returns the
value NULL.

VVVV

Dangling Reference: Once a pointer is freed using the free function then there is no way to retrieve
this storage and any reference to this location is called dangling reference.

Example2:
int i,*p,*f;
i=2;
p=&i;
f=p;
free(p);
*f=*f+2 /* Invalid dangling reference*/

The location that holds the value 2 is freed but still there exist a reference to this location through f
and pointer f will try to access a location that is freed so the pointer f is a dangling reference
Pointers can be dangerous: When pointers are used the following points needs to be taken care
1. When a pointer is not pointing at any object it is a good practise to set it to NULL so that there
is no attempt made to access a memory location that is out of range of our program or that does
not contain a pointer reference to the legitimate object.
