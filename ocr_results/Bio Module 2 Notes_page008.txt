medical equipment such as diagnostic equipment and hospital beds.
Therefore, PLA is a promising biodegradable plastic with wide-ranging applications. While
it offers a sustainable alternative to fossil-fuel plastics, further advancements in recycling,

composting, and cost reduction are needed to enhance its viability in the long term.

DNA Vaccine

A DNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a piece of viral or bacterial DNA to
stimulate an immune response against the pathogen. The vaccine works by introducing the
pathogen's DNA into the body, where it is taken up by cells and used to produce viral or
bacterial proteins. These proteins are then displayed on the surface of the cells, which triggers
an immune response and the production of antibodies against the pathogen. DNA vaccines are
being actively researched and developed for a range of diseases, including cancer, rabies,
influenza, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While the technology is still in its early
stages, it has the potential to revolutionize the field of vaccine development and provide new

treatment options for a range of diseases.

DNA Vaccine for Rabies

A DNA vaccine for rabies is a type of vaccine that uses a piece of rabies virus DNA to
stimulate an immune response against the virus. The vaccine works by introducing the rabies
virus DNA into the body, where it is taken up by cells and used to produce viral proteins. These
viral proteins are then displayed on the surface of the cells, which triggers an immune response

and the production of antibodies against the rabies virus.

Importance of DNA vaccine for rabies DNA vaccines offer several advantages over
traditional vaccines, including their ability to stimulate a strong and long-lasting immune
response with fewer doses required, as well as their ease of manufacture and storage. These
advantages make DNA vaccines particularly useful for preventing the spread of infectious

diseases like rabies. In the case of rabies, DNA vaccines have several key advantages:
