» The two digraphs have the same number of vertices (5) and the same number of directed
edges (7). We observe that the vertex A of the first digraph has 1 as its out-degree and 2 as its
in-degree. There is no such vertex in the second digraph. Therefore, there cannot be any one-

to-one correspondence between the vertices of the two digraphs which preserves the direction

of edges. The two digraphs are therefore not isomorphic. .
