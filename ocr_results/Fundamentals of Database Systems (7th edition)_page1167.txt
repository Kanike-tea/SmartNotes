30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security

To illustrate polyinstantiation further, suppose that a user with security clearance C
tries to update the value of Job_performance of ‘Smith’ in Figure 30.2 to ‘Excellent’;
this corresponds to the following SQL update being submitted by that user:

UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET Job_performance = ‘Excellent’
WHERE Name = ‘Smith’;

Since the view provided to users with security clearance C (see Figure 30.2(b)) per-
mits such an update, the system should not reject it; otherwise, the user could infer
that some nonnull value exists for the Job_performance attribute of ‘Smith’ rather
than the null value that appears. This is an example of inferring information
through what is known as a covert channel, which should not be permitted in
highly secure systems (see Section 30.6.1). However, the user should not be allowed
to overwrite the existing value of Job_performance at the higher classification level.
The solution is to create a polyinstantiation for the ‘Smith’ tuple at the lower clas-
sification level C, as shown in Figure 30.2(d). This is necessary since the new tuple
cannot be filtered from the existing tuple at classification S.

The basic update operations of the relational model (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
must be modified to handle this and similar situations, but this aspect of the prob-
lem is outside the scope of our presentation. We refer the interested reader to the
Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter for further details.

30.3.1 Comparing Discretionary Access Control
and Mandatory Access Control

Discretionary access control (DAC) policies are characterized by a high degree of
flexibility, which makes them suitable for a large variety of application domains.
The main drawback of DAC models is their vulnerability to malicious attacks, such
as Trojan horses embedded in application programs. The reason for this vulnerabil-
ity is that discretionary authorization models do not impose any control on how
information is propagated and used once it has been accessed by users authorized
to do so. By contrast, mandatory policies ensure a high degree of protection—in a
way, they prevent any illegal flow of information. Therefore, they are suitable for
military and high-security types of applications, which require a higher degree of
protection. However, mandatory policies have the drawback of being too rigid in
that they require a strict classification of subjects and objects into security levels,
and therefore they are applicable to few environments and place an additional bur-
den of labeling every object with its security classification. In many practical situa-
tions, discretionary policies are preferred because they offer a better tradeoff
between security and applicability than mandatory policies.

30.3.2 Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) emerged rapidly in the 1990s as a proven tech-
nology for managing and enforcing security in large-scale enterprise-wide systems.
