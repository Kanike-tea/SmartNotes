Guidelines for Using This Book

There are many different ways to teach a database course. The chapters in Parts 1
through 7 can be used in an introductory course on database systems in the order
that they are given or in the preferred order of individual instructors. Selected chap-
ters and sections may be left out and the instructor can add other chapters from the
rest of the book, depending on the emphasis of the course. At the end of the open-
ing section of some of the book’s chapters, we list sections that are candidates for
being left out whenever a less-detailed discussion of the topic is desired. We suggest
covering up to Chapter 15 in an introductory database course and including selected
parts of other chapters, depending on the background of the students and the
desired coverage. For an emphasis on system implementation techniques, chapters
from Parts 7, 8, and 9 should replace some of the earlier chapters.

Chapters 3 and 4, which cover conceptual modeling using the ER and EER models,
are important for a good conceptual understanding of databases. However, they
may be partially covered, covered later in a course, or even left out if the emphasis
is on DBMS implementation. Chapters 16 and 17 on file organizations and indexing
may also be covered early, later, or even left out if the emphasis is on database mod-
els and languages. For students who have completed a course on file organization,
parts of these chapters can be assigned as reading material or some exercises can be
assigned as a review for these concepts.

If the emphasis of a course is on database design, then the instructor should cover
Chapters 3 and 4 early on, followed by the presentation of relational databases. A
total life-cycle database design and implementation project would cover conceptual
design (Chapters 3 and 4), relational databases (Chapters 5, 6, and 7), data model
mapping (Chapter 9), normalization (Chapter 14), and application programs
implementation with SQL (Chapter 10). Chapter 11 also should be covered if the
emphasis is on Web database programming and applications. Additional documen-
tation on the specific programming languages and RDBMS used would be required.
The book is written so that it is possible to cover topics in various sequences. The
following chapter dependency chart shows the major dependencies among chap-
ters. As the diagram illustrates, it is possible to start with several different topics
following the first two introductory chapters. Although the chart may seem com-
plex, it is important to note that if the chapters are covered in order, the dependen-
cies are not lost. The chart can be consulted by instructors wishing to use an
alternative order of presentation.

For a one-semester course based on this book, selected chapters can be assigned as
reading material. The book also can be used for a two-semester course sequence.
The first course, Introduction to Database Design and Database Systems, at the
sophomore, junior, or senior level, can cover most of Chapters 1 through 15. The
second course, Database Models and Implementation Techniques, at the senior or
first-year graduate level, can cover most of Chapters 16 through 30. The two-
semester sequence can also be designed in various other ways, depending on the
preferences of the instructors.
