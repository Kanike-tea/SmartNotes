A database management system that provides three level of data is said to follow three-level
architecture .

e External level

© Conceptual level

e Internal level

External Level :

The external level is at the highest level of database abstraction . At this level, there will be many
views define for different users requirement. A view will describe only a subset of the database. Any
number of user views may exist for a given global schema(coneptual schema).

For example, each student has different view of the time table. the view of a student of BTech
(CSE) is different from the view of the student of Btech (ECE). Thus this level of abstraction is
concerned with different categories of users.

Each external view is described by means of a schema called sub schema.

Conceptual Level :

At this level of database abstraction all the database entities and the relationships among them are
included. One conceptual view represents the entire database. This conceptual view is defined by
the conceptual schema.

The conceptual schema hides the details of physical storage structures and concentrate on
describing entities, data types, relationships, user operations and constraints.

It describes all the records and relationships included in the conceptual view. There is only one
conceptual schema per database. It includes feature that specify the checks to relation data
consistency and integrity.

Internal level :

It is the lowest level of abstraction closest to the physical storage method used. It indicates how the
data will be stored and describes the data structures and access methods to be used by the database.
The internal view is expressed by internal schema.

The following aspects are considered at this level:
1. Storage allocation e.g: B-tree, hashing
2. Access paths eg. specification of primary and secondary keys, indexes etc
3. Miscellaneous eg. Data compression and encryption techniques, optimization of the internal
structures.

Database Users :

Naive Users :
Users who need not be aware of the presence of the database system or any other system supporting
their usage are considered naive users . A user of an automatic teller machine falls on this category.
