SPARSE MATRIX REPRESENTATON

A linked list representation for sparse matrices.

In data representation, each column of a sparse matrix is represented as a circularly linked
list with a header node. A similar representation is used for each row of a sparsematrix.
Each node has a tag field, which is used to distinguish between header nodes and entry
nodes.

Header Node:

e Each header node has three fields: down, right, and next as shown in figure (a).

e The down field is used to link into a column list and the right field to link into a

row list.

e The next field links the header nodes together.

e The header node for row i is also the header node for column i, and the total
number of header nodes is max {number of rows, number of columns}.

Element node:

e Each element node has five fields in addition in addition to the tag field: row, col,
down, right, value as shown) in figure (b).

e The down field is used to link to. the next nonzero term in the same column and the
right field to link to the next nonzero term in the same row. Thus, if aij # 0,
thereis a node with tag field = entry, value = aij, row = i, and col = j as shown in
figure (¢).

¢ Welink this node into the circular linked lists for rowi and column j. Hence,

it is simultaneously linked into two different lists.

next row | col | value
