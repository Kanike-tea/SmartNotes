PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS ; 274

"3. The probability of getting (a) a number greater than 2 (b) an odd number (c) an even
number when a ‘die’ is thrown.

Number of possible cases/outcomes (1) = 6
(a) Number of favourable outcomes = (m) = 4, since 3, 4,5, 6 numbers are
favourable to the event. ~”

Probability of getting a number greater than 2(p) =

_,(b). Number of favourable out comes ( m ) = 3, since 1, 3,5 are favourable to the event.

probability of getting an odd number (p) = 2 = ;
() Similarly we have(p) = ra = _ since 2, 4, 6 are favourable to the event.

'-.¢ Addition theorem of probability

, a The probability of the happening of one or the other mutually exclusive events is equal to the
|. sum of the probabilities of the two events.

‘That i is, if . A,B are two mutually exclusive events then,
P(A orB) = P(A): + P(B)
° Product theorem of: probability
If a compound event is made up of a number of independent events, the probability of the

* happening of the tons ia event is equal to the product of the probabilities of the indepenent
. events.

"That is, If A and B are independent events then P(A and B) = P(A) - P(B)

Random variables - Introduction

’ . Ina random experiment, if a real variable is associated with every outcome then it is

called.a random variable or stochastic variable. In other words a random variable is a
function that assigns a real number to every sample point in the sample space of a
random experiment. Random variables are usually denoted by X, Y, Z--- and it

. may benoted that different random variables may be associated with the same sample

space S, The set of all real numbers of a random variable X is called the range of X.

Example - 1 While tossing a coin, suppose that the value 1 is associated for, the

. outcome ‘head’ and 0 for the outcome ‘tail’. We have the sample space

$={H, T} and if X is the random variable then X(H) = 1& X(T) =

"Range of X = {o, 1}

Example’- 2 Suppose a coin is tossed twice, we shall associate two different random
variables X, Y as follows where we have the sample space
