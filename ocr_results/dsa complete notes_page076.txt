ILINKED LISTS : Sparse Matrices, Doubly Linked List.

(TREES: Introduction, Binary Trees, Binary Tree Traversals, Threaded Binary Trees.

e We can save space and computing time by retaining only the nonzero terms of sparse
matrices.

e In the sequential scheme each nonzero term was represented by a NODE with three fields:
row, column, and value. These NODEs were organized sequentially. However, we found that
when we performed matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, or multiplication, the
number of nonzero terms varied.

e In this section, we study a linked list representation for sparse matrices. Usually, linked lists
allow us to efficiently represent structures that vary in size, a benefit that also applies to
sparse matrices.

e In our data representation, we represent each column of a sparse matrix as a circularly linked
list with a header NODE. We use a similar representation for each row of a sparse matrix.

e Each NODE has a tag field, which we use to distinguish between header NODEs and entry
NODEs.

« Bach header NODE has threé additional fields: down, right, and next.
UiLidown field links into a column list and the

of header NODEs is max {number of rows, number of columns}.

Header Node

e Each entry NODE consist of the following structure

row | col | value
down | _ right

Entry Node

e Each header NODE is in three lists: a list of rows, a list of columns, and a list of header
NODES. The list of header NODEs also has a header NODE that has the same structure as an
entry NODE.

e The row and col value of the header NODE consist of the dimension of the matrix
