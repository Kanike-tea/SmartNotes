Thus, a directed graph can be depicted in a diagram in more than one way. For brevity in
terminology, a diagram of a directed graph itself is often referred to as a directed graph.

Vertices of directed graphs are denoted by upper or lower case letters, like A, By Cy. Uy
v,.++, OF, by letters with suffixes appended to them, like vy, va, ¥3,. 64

As illustrated in Figure 1.1, every directed edge of a digraph (directed graph) is determined
by two vertices of the digraph — a vertex from which it begins and a vertex at which it ends.
Thus, if AB is a directed edge of a digraph D, then it is understood that this directed edge
begins at the vertex A of D and terminates at the vertex B of D. {Here, we say that A is the
initial vertex and B is the terminal vertex of AB) Equivalently, we say that AB is incident out
of A and incident into B. ’

It should be mentioned that for a-directed edge (in a digraph) the initial vertex and the
terminal vertex need not be different. [A directed edge beginning and ending at the same vertex
Ais denoted by AA or (A, A) and is called a directed loop. The directed edge shown in Figure
1.4 is a directed loop which begins and ends at the vertex A.

A digraph can have more than one directed edge having the same initial vertex and the same
‘erminal vertex. Two directed edges having the same initial vertex and the same terminal vertex
