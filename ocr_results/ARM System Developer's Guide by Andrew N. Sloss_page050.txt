2.6 Architecture Revisions 37

be added to the standard ARM instruction set to process vector floating-point (VFP)
operations.

These new instructions are processed in the decode stage of the ARM pipeline. If the
decode stage sees a coprocessor instruction, then it offers it to the relevant coprocessor.
But if the coprocessor is not present or doesn’t recognize the instruction, then the ARM
takes an undefined instruction exception, which allows you to emulate the behavior of the
coprocessor in software.

2.6 ARCHITECTURE REVISIONS

Every ARM processor implementation executes a specific instruction set architecture (ISA),
although an ISA revision may have more than one processor implementation.

The ISA has evolved to keep up with the demands of the embedded market. This
evolution has been carefully managed by ARM, so that code written to execute on an earlier
architecture revision will also execute on a later revision of the architecture.

Before we go on to explain the evolution of the architecture, we must introduce the ARM
processor nomenclature. The nomenclature identifies individual processors and provides
basic information about the feature set.

2.6.1 NOMENCLATURE

ARM uses the nomenclature shown in Figure 2.16 to describe the processor implemen-
tations. The letters and numbers after the word “ARM” indicate the features a processor
