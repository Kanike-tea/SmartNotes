Appendix A Alternative Diagrammatic Notations for ER Models

Figure A.1(c) shows various notations for representing the cardinality ratio of
binary relationships. We used notation (i) in Chapters 7 through 9. Notation (ii)—
known as the chicken feet notation—is quite popular. Notation (iv) uses the arrow as
a functional reference (from the N to the 1 side) and resembles our notation for for-
eign keys in the relational model (see Figure 9.2); notation (v)—used in Bachman
diagrams and the network data model—uses the arrow in the reverse direction (from
the 1 to the N side). For a 1:1 relationship, (ii) uses a straight line without any
chicken feet; (iii) makes both halves of the diamond white; and (iv) places arrow-
heads on both sides. For an M:N relationship, (ii) uses chicken feet at both ends of
the line; (iii) makes both halves of the diamond black; and (iv) does not display any
arrowheads.

Figure A.1(d) shows several variations for displaying (min, max) constraints, which
are used to display both cardinality ratio and total/partial participation. We mostly
used notation (i). Notation (ii) is the alternative notation we used in Figure 7.15 and
discussed in Section 7.7.4. Recall that our notation specifies the constraint that each
entity must participate in at least min and at most max relationship instances.
Hence, for a 1:1 relationship, both max values are 1; for M:N, both max values are n.
A min value greater than 0 (zero) specifies total participation (existence depen-
dency). In methodologies that use the straight line for displaying relationships, it is
common to reverse the positioning of the (min, max) constraints, as shown in (iii); a
variation common in some tools (and in UML notation) is shown in (v). Another
popular technique—which follows the same positioning as (iii)—is to display the
min as 0 (“oh” or circle, which stands for zero) or as | (vertical dash, which stands
for 1), and to display the max as | (vertical dash, which stands for 1) or as chicken
feet (which stands for n), as shown in (iv).

Figure A.1(e) shows some notations for displaying specialization/generalization. We
used notation (i) in Chapter 8, where a d in the circle specifies that the subclasses
(S1, $2, and S3) are disjoint and an o in the circle specifies overlapping subclasses.
Notation (ii) uses G (for generalization) to specify disjoint, and Gs to specify over-
lapping; some notations use the solid arrow, while others use the empty arrow
(shown at the side). Notation (iii) uses a triangle pointing toward the superclass,
and notation (v) uses a triangle pointing toward the subclasses; it is also possible to
use both notations in the same methodology, with (iii) indicating generalization
and (v) indicating specialization. Notation (iv) places the boxes representing
subclasses within the box representing the superclass. Of the notations based on
(vi), some use a single-lined arrow, and others use a double-lined arrow (shown
at the side).

The notations shown in Figure A.1 show only some of the diagrammatic symbols
that have been used or suggested for displaying database conceptual schemes. Other
notations, as well as various combinations of the preceding, have also been used. It
would be useful to establish a standard that everyone would adhere to, in order to
prevent misunderstandings and reduce confusion.
