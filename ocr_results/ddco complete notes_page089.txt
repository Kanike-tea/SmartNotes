COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

b) One address instruction format : Its format is as follows
opcode operand
Ex1: LOAD B

This instruction copies the contents of memory location whose symbolic name is given
by ,,B“ into the Accumulator as shown in the figure.
The mathematical representation of this instruction is as follows
ACC < [B]

Accumulator Memory

rr

Ex2: STORE B
This instruction copies the contents of Accumulator into memory location whose
symbolic name is given by ,,B“ as shown in the figure. The mathematical representation is as
follows
B<—[ACC].
Memory
Accumulator

Ex3: ADD B

. This instruction adds the contents of Accumulator with the contents of Memory
location ,,B“ and result is stored in Accumulator.

e The mathematical, representation of this instruction is as follows
ACC —[ACC}+ [B]

STRIGHT LINE SEQUENCING AND INSTRUCTION EXECUTION

Consider the arithmetic expression
C= A+B , Where A,B,C are the memory operands.
The mathematical representation of this instruction is
C=[A] + [B].
The sequence of instructions using two address instruction format are as follows
MOV A, Ro
ADD B, Ro
MOV Ro, C
Such a program is called as 3 instruction program.
NOTE: The size of each instruction is 32 bits.
