Database Management System [BCS403]

Transaction Processing

The concept of transaction provides a mechanism for describing logical units of database
processing. Transaction processing systems are systems with large databases and hundreds of
concurrent users executing database transactions. Examples:

* airline reservations

+ banking

* credit card processing,

* online retail purchasing,

+ Stock markets, supermarket checkouts, and many other applications
These systems require high availability and fast response time for hundreds of concurrent
users. A transaction is typically implemented by a computer program, which includes database

commands such as retrievals, insertions, deletions, and updates.

5.1 Objectives

“+ To study transaction properties

RY

“To study creation of schedule and maintaining schedule equivalence.

&

:¢ To check whether the given schedule is serailizable or not.

ec

+ To study protocols used for locking objects

&

+ Differentiating between 2PL and Strict 2PL

5.2 Introduction to Transaction Processing
5.2.1 Sifigle-Userversus Multiuser Systems

= One criterion for classifying a database system is according to the number of users who
can use the system concurrently
Single-User versus Multiuser Systems
= ADBMS is
+ single-user
- at most one user at a time can use the system
- Eg: Personal Computer System
+ multiuser
- many users can use the system and hence access the database concurrently

- Eg: Airline reservation database
