Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module 1

Infix, postfix(Suffix) and Prefix(polish)

e Expression is a collection of operands and operators

e Anexpression can be represented in three different ways.
> Infix expression: operators are in between the two operands . Example a+b
> Prefix expression: operators are present before the operands. Example +ab
> Postfix expression: operators are present after the operands. Example ab+

e The prefixes “pre”, “post”, and “in” refer to the relative position of the operator with respect
to the two operands.

To convert an expression from infix to prefix or postfix we follow the rules of precedence.
e Precedence : The order in which different operators are evaluated in an expression is called
precendence
e Associativity : The order in which operators of same precedence are evaluated in an expression

is called Associativity.

The operators are listed in the order of higher precedence down to lower precedence

Operator Associativity
=r left-to-right
Unary operators ~,!,-,+, &, * sizeof Right to left
*/,% left-to-right
+, left-to-right

Converting an expression from infix to postfix

The operands in the infix and the postfix expression are in the same order. With respect to operators ,
precedence of operators plays an important role in converting an infix expression to postfix expression.
We make use of the stack to insert the operators according to their precedence.

The following operations are performed to convert an infix expression to postfix.

e Scan the symbol character by character

°
°
°

If the symbol is an operand place it in the postfix string

If the symbol is an opening parenthesis push it on to the stack

If the symbol is a closing parenthesis pop the contents of the stack until we see an
opening parenthesis and place it in the postfix string. The opening parenthesis and the
closing parenthesis is not placed in the postfix string.

If the symbol is an operator and if the precedence of the input symbol is more than the
precedence of the symbol on top of the stack, then the operator is pushed on to the
stack. If the precedence of the input symbol is lesser than the symbol on top of the stack
we pop each such operators and place it in the postfix string
