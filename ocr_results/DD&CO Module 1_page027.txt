The first line of text is a comment (optional) providing useful information to the reader. The second line
begins with the keyword module and starts the declaration (description) of the module; the last line
completes the declaration with the keyword endmodule. The keyword module is followed by a name
and a list of ports. The name (Simple Circuit in this example) is an identifier. Identifiers are names given
to modules, variables (e.g., a signal), and other elements of the language so that they can be referenced
in the design. In general, we choose meaningful names for modules. Identifiers are composed of alpha-
numeric characters and the underscore (_), and are case sensitive. Identifiers must start with an
alphabetic character or an underscore, but they cannot start with a number.

The port list of a module is the interface between the module and its environment. In this example, the
ports are the inputs and outputs of the circuit. the keywords input and output specify which of the ports
are inputs and which are outputs. Internal connections are declared as wires. The circuit in this example
has one internal connection, at terminal w1, and is declared with the keyword wire. The structure of
the circuit is specified by a list of (predefined) primitive gates, each identified by a descriptive keyword
(and, not, or). The module description ends with the keyword endmodule. Each statement must be

terminated with a semicolon, but there is no semicolon after endmodule.

Gate Delays

All physical circuits exhibit a propagation delay between the transition of an input and a resulting
transition of an output. When an HDL model of a circuit is simulated, it is sometimes necessary to
specify the amount of delay from the input to the output of its gates. In Verilog, the propagation delay
of a gate is specified in terms of time units and by the symbol #. s. The association of a time unit with
physical time is made with the timescale compiler directive. . An example of a timescale directive is

timescale Ins/100ps

// Verilog model of simple circuit with propagation delay

module Simple_Circuit_prop_delay (A, B, C, D, E);

output D, E;
input A, B, C;
wire wl;

and — #(30) G1 (wl, A, B);
not #(10) G2 (E, C);
or —_ #(20) G3 (D, wl, E);

endmodule

The HDL Example repeats the description of the simple circuit of previous Example, but with
propagation delays specified for each gate. The and, or and not gates have a time delay of 30, 20, and

10 ns, respectively. If the circuit is simulated and the inputs change from A, B, C = 0 to A, B, C = 1, the
