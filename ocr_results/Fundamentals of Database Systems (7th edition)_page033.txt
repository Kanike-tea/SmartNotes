Databases and
Database Users

[)ssbase and database systems are an essential
component of life in modern society: most of us
encounter several activities every day that involve some interaction with a database.
For example, if we go to the bank to deposit or withdraw funds, if we make a hotel
or airline reservation, if we access a computerized library catalog to search for a
bibliographic item, or if we purchase something online—such as a book, toy, or
computer—chances are that our activities will involve someone or some computer
program accessing a database. Even purchasing items at a supermarket often auto-
matically updates the database that holds the inventory of grocery items.

These interactions are examples of what we may call traditional database
applications, in which most of the information that is stored and accessed is either
textual or numeric. In the past few years, advances in technology have led to exciting
new applications of database systems. The proliferation of social media Web sites,
such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, among many others, has required the cre-
ation of huge databases that store nontraditional data, such as posts, tweets,
images, and video clips. New types of database systems, often referred to as big data
storage systems, or NOSQL systems, have been created to manage data for social
media applications. These types of systems are also used by companies such as
Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, to manage the data required in their Web search
engines, as well as to provide cloud storage, whereby users are provided with stor-
age capabilities on the Web for managing all types of data including documents,
programs, images, videos and emails. We will give an overview of these new types
of database systems in Chapter 24.

We now mention some other applications of databases. The wide availability of
photo and video technology on cellphones and other devices has made it possible to
