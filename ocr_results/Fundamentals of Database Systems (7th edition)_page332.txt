Chapter 9 Relational Database Design by ER- and EER-to-Relational Mapping

9.2.3 Mapping of Categories (Union Types)

We add another step to the mapping procedure—step 9—to handle categories. A
category (or union type) is a subclass of the union of two or more superclasses
that can have different keys because they can be of different entity types (see Sec-
tion 4.4). An example is the OWNER category shown in Figure 4.8, which is a
subset of the union of three entity types PERSON, BANK, and COMPANY. The
other category in that figure, REGISTERED_VEHICLE, has two superclasses that
have the same key attribute.

Step 9: Mapping of Union Types (Categories). For mapping a category whose
defining superclasses have different keys, it is customary to specify a new key attri-
bute, called a surrogate key, when creating a relation to correspond to the union
type. The keys of the defining classes are different, so we cannot use any one of
them exclusively to identify all entities in the relation. In our example in Figure 4.8,
we create a relation OWNER to correspond to the OWNER category, as illustrated in
Figure 9.7, and include any attributes of the category in this relation. The primary
key of the OWNER relation is the surrogate key, which we called Owner_id. We also
