LECTURE-15: B* Tree Index
B+-Tree Index Files:

B+-tree indices are an alternative to indexed-sequential files.

1. Disadvantage of indexed-sequential files: performance degrades as file grows, since many
overflow blocks get created. Periodic reorganization of entire file is required.

2. Advantage of B+-tree index files: automatically reorganizes itself with small, local,
changes, in the face of insertions and deletions. Reorganization of entire file is not required
to maintain performance.

3. Disadvantage of B+-trees: extra insertion and deletion overhead, space overhead.

4. Advantages of B+-trees outweigh disadvantages, and they are used extensively.

AB+-tree is a rooted tree satisfying the following properties:

1. All paths from root to leaf are of the same length

2. Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between [n/2] and n children.

3. A leaf node has between [(n—1)/2] and n—1 values

4. Special cases:

a. Ifthe root is not a leaf, it has at least 2 children.
b. If the root is a leaf (that is, there are no other nodes in the tree), it can have between
0 and (n—1) values.

Bt-Tree Node Structure

Typical node

P, | Kj | PB |... | Ppa] Kaa | Ph

Pi are pointers to children (for non-leaf nodes) or pointers
to records or buckets of records (for leaf nodes).
The search-keys in a node are ordered
K1<K2<K3<...<Kn

B+-Tree File Organization
1. Index file degradation problem is solved by using B+-Tree indices. Data file degradation

problem is solved by using B+-Tree File Organization.

2. The leaf nodes in a B+-tree file organization store records, instead of pointers.

3. Since records are larger than pointers, the maximum number of records that can be stored in
a leaf node is less than the number of pointers in a non leaf node.
