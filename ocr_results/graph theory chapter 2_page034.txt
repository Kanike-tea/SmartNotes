24. Graph Coloering —_ is

Thus, if the inequality (i) holds for all connected graphs with & vertices, it holds for a
connected graph with k +1 vertices. Hence, by induction, it follows that the inequality (i) holds
for all connected graphs. *

Prove that every connected simple planar graph G is 6-colourable,
p The result is trivially true if G has upto 6 vertices. (Six of less than six vertices can definitely
be properly coloured with six colours in hand). Thus, the result is true for n = 6 (or less than
6), where n is the number of vertices of G, as usual.

Assume that the result is true for all connected simple planar graphs with n = & vertices
Consider a connected simple planar graph G’ with k +1 vertices. Then, by virtue of the Buler’s
theorem, G’ contains a vertex v of degree at most 5*. Consider the graph G’ ~ v. This graph has
k vertices and therefore, by the induction assumption made, is 6-colourable. Since v has at mest
$ neighbours in G’, five colours can be assigned to these 5 neighbours and the sixth colour ean
be assigned to v. Thus, G’ can be properly coloured with 6 colours, Thus, a connected simple
graph with n = k + 1 vertices is 6-colourable if a connected simple graph with n = k vertices is
6-colourable. Hence, by induction, the result is true for any positive integer n. .
