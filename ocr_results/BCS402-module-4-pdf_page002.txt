Table 4.2 Vector table and processor modes

The branch instruction can be any of the following forms:

B <address>—This branch instruction provides a branch relative from
the pe.
LDR pe, [pc, #offset]—This load register instruction loads the handler
address from memory to the pc. This form gives slight delay in branching
as it need the extra memory access. But using this form we can branch to
any address in memory.
LDR pe, [pe, #-Oxff0]—This load register instruction loads a specific
interrupt service routine address from address Oxfffff030 to the pc. This
specific instruction is used when a vector interrupt controller is present
(VIC PL190).
MOV pc, #immediate—This move instruction copies an immediate value
into the pc.The address must be an 8-bit immediate rotated right by an
even number of bits.

4.1.3 Exception Priorities

Exceptions can occur simultaneously, so the processor has to adopt a
priority mechanism.Each exception is dealt with according to the priority
level set out in Table 9.3.

Table 9.3 shows the various exceptions that occur on the ARM processor
and their associated priority level.
