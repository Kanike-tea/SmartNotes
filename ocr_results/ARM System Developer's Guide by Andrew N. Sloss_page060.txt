CHAPTER

INTRODUCTION
TO THE ARM
INSTRUCTION SET

This introduction to the ARM instruction set is a fundamental chapter since the infor-
mation presented here is used throughout the rest of the book. Consequently, it is
placed here before we start going into any depth on optimization and efficient algo-
rithms. This chapter introduces the most common and useful ARM instructions and builds
on the ARM processor fundamentals covered in the last chapter. Chapter 4 introduces
the Thumb instruction set, and Appendix A gives a complete description of all ARM
instructions.

Different ARM architecture revisions support different instructions. However, new
revisions usually add instructions and remain backwardly compatible. Code you write for
architecture ARMv4T should execute on an ARMVSTE processor. Table 3.1 provides a
complete list of ARM instructions available in the ARMv5E instruction set architecture
(ISA). This ISA includes all the core ARM instructions as well as some of the newer features
in the ARM instruction set. The “ARM ISA” column lists the ISA revision in which the
instruction was introduced. Some instructions have extended functionality in later archi-
tectures; for example, the CDP instruction has an ARMV5 variant called CDP2. Similarly,
instructions such as LDR have ARMV5 additions but do not require a new or extended
mnemonic.

We illustrate the processor operations using examples with pre- and post-conditions,
describing registers and memory before and after the instruction or instructions are
