- Optimization and Matching

FE als 2 CEE SE perenne
In Section 3.4. we described a method of constructing a complete binary tree
of minimum weight called an optimal tree. In this chapter, we consider a few
more of such optimization problems, namely those of constructing minimal

spanning trees and finding maximum flows and shortest paths in networks.
The concepts of cut-sets and matchings are also briefly dealt-with.

4.1 Minimal Spanning Tree

Let G be a graph and suppose there is a positive real number associated with each edge of G-
Then G is called a weighted graph and the positive real number associated with an edge ¢ (of
G) is called the weight of the edge e.

For example, consider a graph in which the vertices represent certain cities in a State and
the edges represent the motor roads connecting the cities. Then a road between two cities wil
have a certain length (in Kms, say) which is a positive real number. Thus, with each edge of
the graph there is associated a positive real number, and therefore the graph is'a weighted >"
and the weight of an edge is the length of the road which it represents.

Returning to the general discussion, let us consider a weighted graph G which is connected.
Let T be a spanning tree of this graph. Then every branch of T is an edge in G (because TEMS
subgraph of G), and as such every branch of T has a weight. The sum Bi the weights of all
branches of T is called the weight of T. Thus every spannin connect
graph has a certain weight. : een gine
