The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) or MAC (Multiply-Accumulate Unit) takes the values from Rn and
Rm (possibly after Rm has been preprocessed by the Barrel Shifter35 ) and computes a result35 .

For data processing instructions, the result in Rd is written back to the register file via the Result
bus35 ....

For load and store instructions, the ALU generates an address, which is held in the Address Register
and broadcast on the Address bus35 . An Incrementer can update the address register for sequential
memory accesses36 .

Embedded System Software (with diagram)

Figure 5.1 (not provided, but described) shows typical software components required to control an
embedded device, arranged in abstraction layers37 .... Each layer uses a higher level of abstraction,
separating the code from the hardware37 .

Initialization (Boot) Code: This is the first code executed on the board after reset38 .... It performs
initial hardware configuration, including setting up the memory controller, processor caches, and
initializing some devices39 .... It may also include diagnostics to test the hardware41 .... Finally, it
handles booting, which involves loading the operating system or application image into RAM and
handing control over to it by modifying the program counter42 .... Memory remapping is a common
technique used in the initialization code to allow starting execution from ROM and then relocating
the exception vector table to RAM41 . Initialization code that is fixed on the device is called
firmware44 .

Operating System: Provides an infrastructure to control applications and manage hardware system
resources (peripherals, memory, processing time)38 .... Many embedded systems use simple task
schedulers instead of full operating systems44 . ARM processors support both Real-Time Operating
Systems (RTOSs), which provide guaranteed response times for time-critical applications and
generally do not have secondary storage46 , and Platform Operating Systems, which manage larger,
non-real-time applications and often have secondary storage (e.g., Linux)47 .

Device Drivers: Provide a consistent software interface to the peripherals on the hardware device44

Applications: Perform the specific tasks required for the device44 . A device may have one or
multiple applications running, controlled by the operating system44 .... ARM processors are used in
various application areas like mobile devices, networking, automotive, and mass storage48 .
