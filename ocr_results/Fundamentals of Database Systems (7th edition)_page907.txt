What are the main reasons for and potential advantages of distributed
databases?

What additional functions does a DDBMS have over a centralized DBMS?

Discuss what is meant by the following terms: degree of homogeneity of a
DDBMS, degree of local autonomy of a DDBMS, federated DBMS, distribu-
tion transparency, fragmentation transparency, replication transparency,
multidatabase system.

Discuss the architecture of a DDBMS. Within the context of a centralized
DBMS, briefly explain new components introduced by the distribution of
data.

What are the main software modules of a DDBMS? Discuss the main
functions of each of these modules in the context of the client/server
architecture.

Compare the two-tier and three-tier client/server architectures.

What is a fragment of a relation? What are the main types of fragments?
Why is fragmentation a useful concept in distributed database design?

Why is data replication useful in DDBMSs? What typical units of data are
replicated?

What is meant by data allocation in distributed database design? What typi-
cal units of data are distributed over sites?

How is a horizontal partitioning of a relation specified? How can a relation
be put back together from a complete horizontal partitioning?

How is a vertical partitioning of a relation specified? How can a relation be
put back together from a complete vertical partitioning?

Discuss the naming problem in distributed databases.

Discuss the different techniques for executing an equijoin of two files located
at different sites. What main factors affect the cost of data transfer?

Discuss the semijoin method for executing an equijoin of two files located at
different sites. Under what conditions is an equijoin strategy efficient?

Discuss the factors that affect query decomposition. How are guard condi-
tions and attribute lists of fragments used during the query decomposition
process?

How is the decomposition of an update request different from the decompo-
sition of a query? How are guard conditions and attribute lists of fragments
used during the decomposition of an update request?
