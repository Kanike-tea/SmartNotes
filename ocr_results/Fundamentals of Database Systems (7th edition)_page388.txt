Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP

11.4 Brief Overview of Java Technologies
for Database Web Programming

The parts of the PHP scripting language that we discussed run on the application
server and serve as a conduit that collects client user input through forms, formu-
lates database queries and submits them to the database server, and then creates
dynamic HTML Web pages to display query results. The Java environment has
components that run on the server and other components that can run on the client
machine. It also has standards for exchanging data objects. We briefly discuss some
of these components here that are related to Web and database access. We already
discussed JDBC and SQLJ in some detail in Chapter 10.

Java Servlets. Servlets are Java objects that can reside on the Web server
machine and manage interactions with the client. They can store information
that was submitted by the client during a session, so that this information can
be used to generate database queries. Servlet objects can also store query results
so that parts of these results can be formatted as HTML and sent to the client
for display. The servlet object can maintain all the information produced dur-
ing a particular client interaction until the client session is terminated.

Java Server Pages (JSP). This allows scripting at the server to produce dynamic Web
pages to be sent at the client in a manner somewhat similar to PHP. However, it is
associated with the Java language and the scripting can be combined with Java code.

JavaScript. JavaScript is a scripting language that is different from the Java
programming language and was developed separately. It is widely used in Web
applications, and it can run on the client computer or on the server.

Java Script Object Notation (JSON). This is a text-based representation of
data objects, so that data can be formatted in JSON and exchanged between
clients and servers over the Web in text format. It can be considered as an alter-
native to XML (see Chapter 13) and represents objects using attribute-value
pairs. JSON has also been adopted as the data model by some newer database
systems known as NOSQL systems, such as MongoDB (see Chapter 24).

11.5 Summary

In this chapter, we gave an overview of how to convert some structured data from
databases into elements to be entered or displayed on a Web page. We focused on
the PHP scripting language, which is becoming very popular for Web database pro-
gramming. Section 11.1 presented some PHP basics for Web programming through
a simple example. Section 11.2 gave some of the basics of the PHP language, includ-
ing its array and string data types that are used extensively. Section 11.3 presented
an overview of how PHP can be used to specify various types of database com-
mands, including creating tables, inserting new records, and retrieving database
records. PHP runs at the server computer in comparison to some other scripting
languages that run on the client computer. Section 11.4 introduced some of the
technologies associated with Java that can be used in similar contexts.
