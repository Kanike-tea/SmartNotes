iv) The probability to have either 2 or 3 boys, P(2 < x < 3) = P(2) + P(3)
= 5g, (0.03125) + 5¢, (0.03125)
= 0.03125 + 0.03125

= 0.0625
-. The total number of families may have either 2 or 3 boys, = 800 x 0.0625 = 500.

Poisson Distribution:

Let X be the discrete random variable for any real value 4, such that the probability mass function of
poisson distribution can be defined as,

ey
P(X =x) =PQ@)=\ gO 29
0, otherwise

where, A is called the parameter and,
i) P(X =x) =P(x) 20

eax
x!

ii) Leo P@) = Lr-o =u
iii) Mean up = np =A
iv) Vairance o? = A, S.D = VA
The poisson distribution can be used to find the probabaility that an event might happen a definite

number of times based on how often it usually occurs and the companies can utilize the poisson
distribution to examine how they may be able to take steps to improve their operational effieciency.
