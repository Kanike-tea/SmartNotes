Step 7: Mapping of N-ary Relationship Types

= For each n-ary relationship type R

* Create a new relation S to represent R

Database Management System [BCS403]

* Include primary keys of participating entity types as foreign keys

+ Include any simple attributes as attributes

= The primary key of S is usually a combination of all the foreign keys that reference the

relations representing the participating entity types.

« For example, consider the relationship type SUPPLY.This can be mapped to the relation

SUPPLY whose primary key is the combination of the three foreign keys {Sname,

Part_no, Proj_name}.
