Database Management System [BCS403]

Similarly, a NATURAL JOIN can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT preceded by
RENAME and followed by SELECT and PROJECT operations. Hence, the various JOIN operations

are also not strictly necessary for the expressive power of the relational algebra.

2.4.4 The DIVISION Operation

The DIVISION operation, denoted by ~, is useful for a special kind of query that sometimes occurs

in database applications. An example is Retrieve the names of employees who work on all the

projects that ‘John Smith’ works on. To express this query using the DIVISION operation, proceed

as follows.

First, retrieve the list of project numbers that ‘John Smith’ works on in the intermediate
relation SMITH_PNOS:

SSN_PNOS © me... po(WORKS_ON)

Next, create a relation that includes a tuple <Pno, Essn> whenever the employee whose Ssn is

Essn works on the project whose number is Pno in the intermediate relation SSN_PNOS:

SMITH © Gf,csne-\fohw’ AND Lnamo-simtii( EMPLOYEE)
SMITH_PNOS © zppg( WORKSZON ™* 5205, SenSMITH)

Finally, apply the DIVISION operation to the two relations, which gives the desired

employees’ Social Security numbers:

SSNS(Ssn) — SSN_PNOS + SMITH_PNOS
RESULT — ame, tname( SSNS * EMPLOYEE)
