Workers behind the Scene

1. DBMS system designers and implementers: design and implement the DBMS modules and
interfaces as a software package. A DBMS is a very complex software system that consists of
many components, or modules, including modules for implementing the catalog, query
language processing, interface processing, accessing and buffering data, controlling
concurrency, and handling data recovery and security.

2. Tool developers: design and implement tools that facilitate database modeling and design,
database system design, and improved performance.

3. Operators and maintenance personnel (system administration personnel) : responsible for
the actual running and maintenance of the hardware and software environment for the database

system.

1.3 Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach

1. Controlling Redundancy
Data redundancy such as tends to occur in the "file processing" approach leads to wasted
storage space, duplication of effort and a higher likelihood of the introduction of
inconsistency.
In the database approach, the views of different user groups are integrated during database

design. This is known as data normalization, and it ensures consistency and saves storage
