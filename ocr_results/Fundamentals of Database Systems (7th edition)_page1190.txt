What is the difference between discretionary and mandatory access control?

What are the typical security classifications? Discuss the simple security
property and the *-property, and explain the justification behind these rules
for enforcing multilevel security.

Describe the multilevel relational data model. Define the following terms:
apparent key, polyinstantiation, filtering.

What are the relative merits of using DAC or MAC?

What is role-based access control? In what ways is it superior to DAC and
MAC?

What are the two types of mutual exclusion in role-based access control?
What is meant by row-level access control?

What is label security? How does an administrator enforce it?

What are the different types of SQL injection attacks?

What risks are associated with SQL injection attacks?

What preventive measures are possible against SQL injection attacks?

What is a statistical database? Discuss the problem of statistical database
security.

How is privacy related to statistical database security? What measures can be
taken to ensure some degree of privacy in statistical databases?

What is flow control as a security measure? What types of flow control exist?
What are covert channels? Give an example of a covert channel.

What is the goal of encryption? What process is involved in encrypting data
and then recovering it at the other end?

. Give an example of an encryption algorithm and explain how it works.

Repeat the previous question for the popular RSA algorithm.

What is a symmetric key algorithm for key-based security?

- What is the public key infrastructure scheme? How does it provide security?

What are digital signatures? How do they work?

What type of information does a digital certificate include?
