11) Every year, aman trades his car for anew car. If he has a Maruthi, he trades it for an Ambassador.
If he has an Ambassador, he trades it for Santro. However if he had a Santro, he is just as likely
to trade it for a Maruthi or an Ambassador. In 2000 he bought his first car which was a Santro.
Find the probability that he has,
i) 2002 Santro
ii) 2002 Maruthi
iii) 2003 Ambassador
iv) 2003 Santro
