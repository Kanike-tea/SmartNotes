1028 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

Web search combines both aspects—browsing and retrieval—and is one of the
main applications of information retrieval today. Web pages are analogous to docu-
ments. Web search engines maintain an indexed repository of Web pages, usually
using the technique of inverted indexing (see Section 27.5). They retrieve the most
relevant Web pages for the user in response to the user’s search request with a pos-
sible ranking in descending order of relevance. The rank of a Web page in a
retrieved set is the measure of its relevance to the query that generated the result set.

27.1.5 Generic IR Pipeline

As we mentioned earlier, documents are made up of unstructured natural language
text composed of character strings from English and other languages. Common
examples of documents include newswire services (such as AP or Reuters), corporate
manuals and reports, government notices, Web page articles, blogs, tweets, books,
and journal papers. There are two main approaches to IR: statistical and semantic.

Ina statistical approach, documents are analyzed and broken down into chunks of
text (words, phrases, or n-grams, which are all subsequences of length n characters
in a text or document) and each word or phrase is counted, weighted, and mea-
sured for relevance or importance. These words and their properties are then com-
pared with the query terms for potential degree of match to produce a ranked list of
resulting documents that contain the words. Statistical approaches are further clas-
sified based on the method employed. The three main statistical approaches are
Boolean, vector space, and probabilistic (see Section 27.2).

Semantic approaches to IR use knowledge-based techniques of retrieval that
broadly rely on the syntactic, lexical, sentential, discourse-based, and pragmatic
levels of knowledge understanding. In practice, semantic approaches also apply
some form of statistical analysis to improve the retrieval process.

Figure 27.1 shows the various stages involved in an IR processing system. The steps
shown on the left in Figure 27.1 are typically offline processes, which prepare a set of
documents for efficient retrieval; these are document preprocessing, document
modeling, and indexing. The right side of Figure 27.1 deals with the process of a user
interacting with the IR system either during a querying, browsing, or searching. It
shows the steps involved; namely, query formation, query processing, searching
mechanism, document retrieval, and relevance feedback, In each box, we highlight
the important concepts and issues. The rest of this chapter describes some of the
concepts involved in the various tasks within the IR process shown in Figure 27.1.

Figure 27.2 shows a simplified IR processing pipeline. In order to perform retrieval
on documents, the documents are first represented in a form suitable for retrieval.
The significant terms and their properties are extracted from the documents and
are represented in a document index where the words/terms and their properties
are stored in a matrix that contains each individual document in a row and each
row contains the references to the words contained in those documents. This index
is then converted into an inverted index (see Figure 27.4) of a word/term versus
document matrix. Given the query words, the documents containing these words—
