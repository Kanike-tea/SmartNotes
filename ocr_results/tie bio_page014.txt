6. Explain the function of Heart as a pumping system.
Answer:

Heart is sort of like a pump, or two pumps in one. The right side of your heart receives blood
from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart does the exact opposite: It
receives blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the body. While an LVAD consists of thick
tubes and a pump connected externally to the heart muscle and aorta, percutaneous heart
pumps place a much smaller tube inside the heart's chambers. These tiny heart pumps are
placed in the heart via a thin tube called a catheter that is threaded through a puncture site in
the skin. The human heart is very strong and is capable of pumping blood up to 30 feet
distance. An average heart beats maximum of 70-80 beats per minute and is considered
healthy. The efficiency of the heart can be maintained and improved by performing physical
activity. The heart is called a double pump because each side pumps blood to a different
circulation. Deoxygenated blood from the body drains to the right side of the heart. This is
the first pump that sends blood to the lungs, called the pulmonary circulation, where it
becomes oxygenated and releases carbon dioxide.

Here is what happens as blood flows through the heart and lungs:

The blood first enters the right atrium. The blood then flows through the tricuspid valve into
the right ventricle. When the heart beats, the ventricle pushes blood through the pulmonic
valve into the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery carries blood to the lungs where it
“picks up” oxygen. It then leaves the lungs to return to the heart through the pulmonary vein.
The blood enters the left atrium. It drops through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The
left ventricle then pumps blood through the aortic valve and into the aorta. The aorta is the
artery that feeds the rest of the body through a system of blood vessels. Blood returns to the
heart from the body via two large blood vessels called the superior vena cava and the inferior
vena cava. This blood carries little oxygen, as it is returning from the body where oxygen was
used. The vena cava pump blood into the right atrium and the cycle begins all over again.
