12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts

Specifying Object Persistence via Naming and Reachability. An ODBS is
often closely coupled with an object-oriented programming language (OOPL). The
OOPL is used to specify the method (operation) implementations as well as other
application code. Not all objects are meant to be stored permanently in the data-
base. Transient objects exist in the executing program and disappear once the pro-
gram terminates. Persistent objects are stored in the database and persist after
program termination. The typical mechanisms for making an object persistent are
naming and reachability.

The naming mechanism involves giving an object a unique persistent name within
a particular database. This persistent object name can be given via a specific state-
ment or operation in the program, as shown in Figure 12.3. The named persistent
objects are used as entry points to the database through which users and applica-
tions can start their database access. Obviously, it is not practical to give names to
all objects in a large database that includes thousands of objects, so most objects are
made persistent by using the second mechanism, called reachability. The reach-
ability mechanism works by making the object reachable from some other persis-
tent object. An object B is said to be reachable from an object A if a sequence of
references in the database lead from object A to object B.

If we first create a named persistent object N, whose state is a set of objects of some
class C, we can make objects of C persistent by adding them to the set, thus making
them reachable from N. Hence, N is a named object that defines a persistent
collection of objects of class C. In the object model standard, N is called the extent
of C (see Section 12.3).

For example, we can define a class DEPARTMENT_SET (see Figure 12.3) whose
objects are of type set(DEPARTMENT).'° We can create an object of type
DEPARTMENT_SET, and give it a persistent name ALL_DEPARTMENTS, as shown in
Figure 12.3. Any DEPARTMENT object that is added to the set of ALL_DEPARTMENTS
by using the add_dept operation becomes persistent by virtue of its being reach-
able from ALL_DEPARTMENTS. As we will see in Section 12.3, the OOMG ODL
standard gives the schema designer the option of naming an extent as part of
class definition.

Notice the difference between traditional database models and ODBs in this respect.
In traditional database models, such as the relational model, all objects are assumed
to be persistent. Hence, when a table such as EMPLOYEE is created in a relational
database, it represents both the type declaration for EMPLOYEE and a persistent set
of all EMPLOYEE records (tuples). In the OO approach, a class declaration of
EMPLOYEE specifies only the type and operations for a class of objects. The user
must separately define a persistent object of type set(EMPLOYEE) whose value is the
collection of references (OIDs) to all persistent EMPLOYEE objects, if this is desired,
as shown in Figure 12.3.'! This allows transient and persistent objects to follow the

10s we will see in Section 12.3, the ODMG ODL syntax uses set<DEPARTMENT> instead of
set(DEPARTMENT).

''Some systems, such as POET, automatically create the extent for a class.
