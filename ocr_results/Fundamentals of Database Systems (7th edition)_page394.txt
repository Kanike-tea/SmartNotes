Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases

Another reason for the creation of object-oriented databases is the vast increase in
the use of object-oriented programming languages for developing software applica-
tions. Databases are fundamental components in many software systems, and tradi-
tional databases are sometimes difficult to use with software applications that are
developed in an object-oriented programming language such as C++ or Java. Object
databases are designed so they can be directly—or seamlessly—integrated with soft-
ware that is developed using object-oriented programming languages.

Relational DBMS (RDBMS) vendors have also recognized the need for incorporat-
ing features that were proposed for object databases, and newer versions of rela-
tional systems have incorporated many of these features. This has led to database
systems that are characterized as object-relational or ORDBMSs. A recent version
of the SQL standard (2008) for RDBMSs, known as SQL/Foundation, includes
many of these features, which were originally known as SQL/Object and have now
been merged into the main SQL specification.

Although many experimental prototypes and commercial object-oriented database
systems have been created, they have not found widespread use because of the pop-
ularity of relational and object-relational systems. The experimental prototypes
included the Orion system developed at MCC, OpenOODB at Texas Instruments,
the Iris system at Hewlett-Packard laboratories, the Ode system at AT&T Bell Labs,
and the ENCORE/ObServer project at Brown University. Commercially available
systems included GemStone Object Server of GemStone Systems, ONTOS DB
of Ontos, Objectivity/DB of Objectivity Inc., Versant Object Database and
FastObjects by Versant Corporation (and Poet), ObjectStore of Object Design, and
Ardent Database of Ardent.

As commercial object DBMSs became available, the need for a standard model and
language was recognized. Because the formal procedure for approval of standards
normally takes a number of years, a consortium of object DBMS vendors and users,
called ODMG, proposed a standard whose current specification is known as the
ODMG 3.0 standard.

Object-oriented databases have adopted many of the concepts that were developed
originally for object-oriented programming languages.’ In Section 12.1, we describe
the key concepts utilized in many object database systems and that were later incor-
porated into object-relational systems and the SQL standard. These include object
identity, object structure and type constructors, encapsulation of operations, and the
definition of methods as part of class declarations, mechanisms for storing objects
in a database by making them persistent, and type and class hierarchies and inheri-
tance. Then, in Section 12.2 we see how these concepts have been incorporated into
the latest SQL standards, leading to object-relational databases. Object features
were originally introduced in SQL:1999, and then updated in SQL:2008. In Sec-
tion 12.3, we turn our attention to “pure” object database standards by presenting
features of the object database standard ODMG 3.0 and the object definition

3Similar concepts were also developed in the fields of semantic data modeling and knowledge
representation.
