Example with don’t-care conditions

with minterm m3 to give the three-literal term w'x'z. However, by including one or two
adjacent X’s we can combine four adjacent squares to give a two-literal term. In Fig.
3.15(a), don’t-care minterms O and 2 are included with the 1’s, resulting in the simpli-
fied function

F=yzt+w'x'

In Fig. 3.15(b), don’t-care minterm 5 is included with the 1’s, and the simplified
function is now

F=yzt+w'z

Either one of the preceding two expressions satisfies the conditions stated for this
example.

Solve S=F(A,B,C,D)=Zm(7)+d(10,11,12,13,14,15) using K map to get minimum
SOP expression

S=sBCD

Solve S =F(A,B,C,D)=Zm(2,3,5,7,10,12)+d(11,15) using K map to get minimum SOP
expression
