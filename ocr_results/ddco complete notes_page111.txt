Digital Design &Computer Organization(BCS302) Module -4

¢ At the time of execution of ISR for some device, priority of processor is raised to
that of the device.

¢ Thus, interrupts from devices at the same level of priority or lower are disabled.
Privileged Instruction

¢ Processor's priority is encoded in a few bits of PS word. (PS = Processor-Status).
« Encoded-bits can be changed by Privileged Instructions that write into PS.

¢ Privileged-instructions can be executed only while processor is running in
Supervisor Mode.

¢ Processor is in supervisor-mode only when executing operating-system routines.
Privileged Exception
¢ User program cannot

— accidently or intentionally change the priority of the processor &

— disrupt the system-operation.

¢ An attempt to execute a privileged-instruction while in user-mode leads to a
Privileged Exception.

SIMULTANEOUS REQUESTS
DAISY CHAIN

¢ The daisy chain with multiple priority levels is as shown in the figure.
e The interrupt request line INTR is common to all devices as shown in the fig.

e The interrupt acknowledge line is connected in a daisy fashion as shown in the figure.
e This signal propagates serially from one device to another device.
e The several devices raise an interrupt by activating INTR signal. In response to

the signal, processortransfers its device by activating INTA signal.

e This signal is received by device 1. The device-1 blocks the propagation of INTA
signal to device-2,when it needs processor service.

e The device-1 transfers the INTA signal to next device when it does not require the
processor service.

e In daisy chain arrangement device-1 has the highest priority.
Advantage: It requires fewer wires than the individual connection
