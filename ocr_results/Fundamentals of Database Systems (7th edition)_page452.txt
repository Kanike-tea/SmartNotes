Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases

Selected Bibliography

Object-oriented database concepts are an amalgam of concepts from OO pro-
gramming languages and from database systems and conceptual data models. A
number of textbooks describe OO programming languages—for example,
Stroustrup (1997) for C++, and Goldberg and Robson (1989) for Smalltalk.
Books by Cattell (1994) and Lausen and Vossen (1997) describe OO database
concepts. Other books on OO models include a detailed description of the
experimental OODBMS developed at Microelectronic Computer Corporation
called ORION and related OO topics by Kim and Lochovsky (1989). Bancilhon
et al. (1992) describes the story of building the O02 OODBMS with a detailed
discussion of design decisions and language implementation. Dogac et al.
(1994) provides a thorough discussion on OO database topics by experts at a
NATO workshop.

There is a vast bibliography on OO databases, so we can only provide a repre-
sentative sample here. The October 1991 issue of CACM and the December
1990 issue of ieee Computer describe OO database concepts and systems. Dit-
trich (1986) and Zaniolo et al. (1986) survey the basic concepts of OO data
models. An early paper on OO database system implementation is Baroody and
DeWitt (1981). Su et al. (1988) presents an OO data model that was used in
CAD/CAM applications. Gupta and Horowitz (1992) discusses OO applica-
tions to CAD, Network Management, and other areas. Mitschang (1989)
extends the relational algebra to cover complex objects. Query languages and
graphical user interfaces for OO are described in Gyssens et al. (1990), Kim
(1989), Alashqur et al. (1989), Bertino et al. (1992), Agrawal et al. (1990), and
Cruz (1992).

The Object-Oriented Manifesto by Atkinson et al. (1990) is an interesting arti-
cle that reports on the position by a panel of experts regarding the mandatory
and optional features of OO database management. Polymorphism in databases
and OO programming languages is discussed in Osborn (1989), Atkinson and
Buneman (1987), and Danforth and Tomlinson (1988). Object identity is dis-
cussed in Abiteboul and Kanellakis (1989). OO programming languages for
databases are discussed in Kent (1991). Object constraints are discussed in Del-
cambre et al. (1991) and Elmasri, James, and Kouramajian (1993). Authoriza-
tion and security in OO databases are examined in Rabitti et al. (1991) and
Bertino (1992).

Cattell et al. (2000) describe the ODMG 3.0 standard, which is described in this
chapter, and Cattell et al. (1993) and Cattell et al. (1997) describe the earlier
versions of the standard. Bancilhon and Ferrari (1995) give a tutorial presenta-
tion of the important aspects of the ODMG standard. Several books describe
the CORBA architecture—for example, Baker (1996).

The O2 system is described in Deux et al. (1991), and Bancilhon et al. (1992)
includes a list of references to other publications describing various aspects of
2. The O2 model was formalized in Velez et al. (1989). The ObjectStore system
