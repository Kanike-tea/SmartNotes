Threaded Binary Tree
Threads

A binary tree has more NULL links than pointers. These null links can be replaced by special
pointers, called threads, to other nodes in the tree.

Two way threading
To construct the threads we use the following rules (assume that ptr represents a node):
e If ptr — leftChild is null, replace ptr — leftChild with a pointer to the inorder predecessor of
ptr.
e . If ptr — rightChild is null, replace ptr — rightChild with a pointer to the inorder successor of

ptr.

One way threading: If ptr — rightChild is null, replace ptr — rightChild with a pointer to the
inorder successor of ptr. Ptr->left child remains unchanged.

Note : unless specified we consider threading corresponds to the inorder traversal. To distinguish the
threads from ordinary pointers, threads are always drawn with broken links

Example: consider the binary tree and the corresponding threaded tree given below
