A sequence of events during a read-operation
> At time tO, the master (processor)
= — places the device-address on address-lines &
= — sends an appropriate command on control-lines (Figure 7.3).

= — indicate an input operation &
= = specify the length of the operand to be read.
Information travels over bus at a speed determined by physical & electrical characteristics.
Clock pulse width(t1-t0) must be longer than max. propagation-delay b/w devices connected to bus.
The clock pulse width should be long to allow the devices to decode the address & control signals.
The slaves take no action or place any data on the bus before t1.
Information on bus is unreliable during the period tO to t1 because signals are changing state.
Slave places requested input-data on data-lines at time t1.
At end of clock cycle (at time t2), master strobes (captures) data on data-lines into its input-buffer

For data to be loaded correctly into a storage device,
o data must be available at input of that device for a period greater than setup-time of device.
