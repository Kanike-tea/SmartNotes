DIFFERENCES MULTIPROCESSOR AND MULTICOMPUTER

MULTIPROCESSOR

MULTICOMPUTER

1. It is a process of interconnection of two or
more processors by means of system bus.

It is a process of interconnection of two or
more computers by means of system bus.

2. It uses common memory to hold the data
and instructions.

It has its own memory to store data and
instructions.

3. Complexity in hardware design.

Not much complexity in hardware design.

4. Difficult to program for multiprocessor

Easy to program for multiprocessor system

system.

4. MEMORY LOCATIONS AND ADDRESSES

1. Memory is a storage device. It is used to store character operands, data operands and
instructions.
De It consists of number of semiconductor cells and each cell holds | bit of information. A

group of 8 bits is called as,byte and a group of 16 on,32 or 64 bits is called as word.
World length = 16 for 16 bit CPU and World length = 32 for 32 bit CPU. Word length is defined
as number of bits in a word.
e Memory is organized in terms of bytes or words.
e The organization of memory for 32 bit processor is as shown in the fig.

The contents of memory location can be accessed for read and write operation. The memory is
accessed either by specifying address of the memory location or by name of the memory location.
