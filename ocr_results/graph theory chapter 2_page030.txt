> (i) For the graph (a), let us assign a colour @ to the vertex v;. Then, for a proper colouring,
we have to assign a different colour to its neighbours v2, v4, ve. Since v2, v4, v6 are
mutually nonadjacent vertices, they can have the same colour, say 6 (which is different
from @). Since v3, vs are not adjacent to v;, these can have the same colour as vj, namely
@.

Thus, the graph can be property coloured with at least two colours, with the vertices
v1, v3, vs having one colour a, and v2, v4, v6 having a different colour 8. Hence, the
chromatic number of the graph is 2.

(ii) For the graph (b), let us assign the colour a to the vertex vj. Then, for a proper colouring,
its neighbours v2, v3 and v4 cannot have the colour @, but vs can have the colour a.
Furthermore, v2, v3, v4 must have different colours, say 8, y, 6. Thus, at least four
colours are required for a proper colouring of the graph. Hence the chromatic number of
the graph is 4.

(iii) For the graph (c), we can assign the same colour, say @, to the non-adjacent vertices
¥1, ¥3, v5. Then the vertices v2, v4;-¥6 can be assigned the same colour other than a.
Suppose we assign a colour, f to v2, 4, Y6- Consequently v7 and vg can be assigned the
same colour which is different from, both @ and f. Thus, a minimum of three colours are
needed for a proper colouring of the graph. Hence its chromatic number is 3. .
