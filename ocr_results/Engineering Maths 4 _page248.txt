By symmetry we can simply write down the expression for ( w; — W,), (w, - 3 )

and (w, - w,)

LHS of (1) becomes,
(ad — be) (z, ~ 2) (ad - be) (2, - 24)
(ca +4) (ca +d) (cy +d) (cd) (2-2) (2 -%)
(ad ~ be) (2-253) (ad ~ be) (4-24) (2 —-%)(%-%)
(Cay +d)(cz +d) (czy +d)(cz, +d)

This proves that the cross ratio of a set of four points is preserved under the

. bilinear transformation.

Theorem-3 Every bilinear. transformation map circles or straight lines in the z-plane into
circles or straight lines in the w-plane.

Note: The general equation of a circle in the cartesian form x4 ¥ +2gx+2fy+c=0
can be put in the complex form :

Azz+Bz+Bz+C = 0 where A , C are real constants and B isa complex constant
satisfying the condition BB = AC. Further when A‘= 0, the equation represents a
straight line.

Proof: Let w =~ ae where ad — bc # 0 be the BLT.

ie., w(cz+d)=az+b or z(cw-a)=-dwt+b

Let us consider the equation of a citcle in the complex form,
. Azz+Bz+BitC'=0 ++(1)

Substituting the expressions for z,z we obtain,
