Directed Graphs and Graphs

The first four chapters of this book are concerned with Graph Theory, 1n this
chapter we first introduce and illustrate the conepts of directed graphs and

graphs. Then we present some basic material oncerned with graphs and related
concepts”.

1.1 Directed Graphs

Look at the diagram shown below. This diagram consists of four vertices A, B, C, D and three
edges AB, CD, CA with directions attached to them, the directions being indicated by arrows.
Because of attaching directions to the edges, the edge AB has to be interpreted as an edge from
the vertex A to the vertex B and it cannot be written as BA. Similarly, the edge CD is from C to
D and cannot be written as DC, and the edge CA is from C to A and cannot be written as AC,
Thus, here, the edges AB, CD, CA are directed edges**.

The directed edge AB is determined by the vertices A and B in that order and may therefore
be represented by the ordered pair (A, B). Similarly, the directed edges CD and CA may be
Tepresented by the ordered pairs (C, D) and (C, A) respectively. Thus, the diagram in Figure
LI consists of a nonempty set of vertices, namely (A, B,C, D}, and a set of directed edges
Tepresented by ordered pairs of vertices taken from this set, namely {(A, B),(C, D),(C,A)}.
Such a diagram is called a diagram of a directed graph (or a diagraph for brevity),

The formal definition of a directed graph is given below.

In graph theory, the definitions, notation and terminology are not yet standardized; they generally vary from
°n€ author to the other. The reader has to keep this in mind while using different books.

i one wishes, these edges may also be denoted by AB, CD, CA to emphasize that these are actually directed
