It is easy to construct a Hamiltonian circuit in a complete graph of n vertices.
Let the vertices be numbered vj, v2 ,. .., V,. Since an edge exists between any

two vertices, we can start from v, and traverse to vy, and v3, and so on to v,,, and
finally from v, to v;. This is a Hamiltonian circuit.

Number of Hamiltonian Circuits in a Graph: A given graph may contain more
than one Hamiltonian circuit. Of interest are all the edge-disjoint Hamiltonian
circuits in a graph. The determination of the exact number of edge-disjoint
Hamiltonian circuits (or paths) in a graph in general is also an unsolved problem.
However, the number of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian circuits in a complete graph
with odd number of vertices is given by Theorem 2-8.

THEOREM 2-8

In a complete graph with n vertices there are (n — 1)/2 edge-disjoint
Hamiltonian circuits, if n is an odd number > 3.

Proof: A complete graph G of n vertices has n(n — 1)/2 edges, and a
Hamiltonian circuit in G consists of n edges. Therefore, the number of edge-
disjoint Hamiltonian circuits in G cannot exceed (n — 1)/2. That there are (n — 1)/2
edge-disjoint Hamiltonian circuits, when n is odd, can be shown as follows:

The subgraph (of a complete graph of n vertices) in Fig. 2-24 is a Hamiltonian
circuit. Keeping the vertices fixed on a circle, rotate the polygonal pattern
clockwise by 360/(n — 1), 2:360/(n — 1), 3:360/(n - 1), ..., (n — 3)/2:360/(n - 1)
degrees. Observe that each rotation produces a Hamiltonian circuit that has no
edge in common with any of the previous ones. Thus we have (n - 3)/2 new
Hamiltonian circuits, all edge disjoint from the one in Fig. 2-24 and also edge
disjoint among themselves. Hence the theorem. =
