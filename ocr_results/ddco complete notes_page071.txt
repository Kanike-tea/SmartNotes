Cache Memory
As an adjunct to the main memory, a smaller, faster RAM unit, called a cache, is used
to hold sections of a program that are currently being executed, along with any

associated data.

The cache is tightly coupled with the processor and is usually contained on the same
integrated-circuit chip.

The purpose of the cache is to facilitate high instruction execution rates.
At the start of program execution, the cache is empty.
All program instructions and any required data are stored in the main memory.

As execution proceeds, instructions are fetched into the processor chip, and a copy of
each is placed in the cache.

When the execution of an instruction requires data located in the main memory,
thedata are fetched and copies are also placed in the cache.

Secondary Storage

Vv

Primary memory is essential, it tends to be expensive and does not retain information
when power is turned off.

Thus additional, less expensive, permanent secondary storage is used when large
amounts of data and many programs have to be stored, particularly for information
that is accessed infrequently.

> Access times for secondary storage are longer than for primary memory.

A wide selection of secondary storage devices is available, including magnetic disks,

optical disks (DVD and CD), and flash memory devices.

Arithmetic and Logic Unit

o Most computer operations are executed in the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) of
the processor.

o Any arithmetic or logic operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, or comparison of numbers, is initiated by bringing the required
operandsinto the processor, where the operation is performed by the ALU.

o For example, if two numbers located in the memory are to be added,
they are brought into the processor, and the addition is carried out by the ALU.

o The sum may then be stored in the memory or retained in the processor for
immediate use.

o When operands are brought into the processor, they are stored in high-speed
storage elements called registers.

o Each register can store one word of data.

o Access times to registers are even shorter than access times to the cache unit on
the processor chip.
