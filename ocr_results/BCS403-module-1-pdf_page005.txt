Database Management System [BCS403]

As with software in general, design of a new application for an existing database or design of
abrand new database starts off with a phase called requirements specification and

analysis. These requirements are documented in detail and transformed into aconceptual design
that can be represented and manipulated using some computerizedtools so that it can be easily

maintained, modified, and transformed into a databaseimplementation.

The design is then translated to alogical design that can be expressed in a data model implemented
in a commercialDBMS. The final stage isphysical design, during which further specifications are
provided for storing andaccessing the database. The database design is implemented, populated

with actualdata, and continuously maintained to reflect the state of the miniworld.

1.2 Characteristics of the Database Approach

Database approach ys. File Processing approach

Consider an organization that is organized as a collection of departments/offices. Each department

has certain data processing "needs", many of which are unique to it.

In the file processing approach, each department would control a collection of relevant data files
and software applications to: manipulate that data. For example, one user, the grade reporting
office, maykeep files on students and their grades. Programs to print a student’s transcript andto
enter new grades are implemented as part of the application. A second user, theaccounting office,
may keep track of students’ fees and their payments. Althoughboth users are interested in data
about students, each user maintains separate files—and programs to manipulate these files—
because each requires some data not available from the other user’s files.This redundancy in
defining and storing data resultsin wasted storage space and in redundant efforts to maintain

common up-to-datedata.

In the database approach, a single repository maintains data that is defined onceand then accessed
by various users. In file systems, each application is free to namedata elements independently. In
contrast, in a database, the names or labels of dataare defined once, and used repeatedly by queries,

transactions, and applications.
