In this section, we describe some characteristics of magnetic disk and magnetic tape
storage devices. Readers who have already studied these devices may simply browse

16.2.1 Hardware Description of Disk Devices

Magnetic disks are used for storing large amounts of data. The device that holds the
disks is referred to as a hard disk drive, or HDD. The most basic unit of data on the
disk is a single bit of information. By magnetizing an area on a disk in certain ways,
one can make that area represent a bit value of either 0 (zero) or 1 (one). To code
information, bits are grouped into bytes (or characters). Byte sizes are typically 4 to
8 bits, depending on the computer and the device; 8 bits is the most common. We
assume that one character is stored in a single byte, and we use the terms byte and
character interchangeably. The capacity of a disk is the number of bytes it can store,
which is usually very large. Small floppy disks were used with laptops and desk-
tops for many years—they contained a single disk typically holding from 400 KB
to 1.5 MB; they are almost completely out of circulation. Hard disks for personal
computers currently hold from several hundred gigabytes up to a few terabytes; and
large disk packs used with servers and mainframes have capacities of hundreds of
gigabytes. Disk capacities continue to grow as technology improves.

Whatever their capacity, all disks are made of magnetic material shaped as a thin
circular disk, as shown in Figure 16.1(a), and protected by a plastic or acrylic cover.
A disk is single-sided if it stores information on one of its surfaces only and double-
sided if both surfaces are used. To increase storage capacity, disks are assembled
into a disk pack, as shown in Figure 16.1(b), which may include many disks and
therefore many surfaces. The two most common form factors are 3.5 and 2.5 inch
diameter. Information is stored on a disk surface in concentric circles of small
width,” each having a distinct diameter. Each circle is called a track. In disk packs,
tracks with the same diameter on the various surfaces are called a cylinder because
of the shape they would form if connected in space. The concept of a cylinder is
important because data stored on one cylinder can be retrieved much faster than if
it were distributed among different cylinders.

The number of tracks on a disk ranges from a few thousand to 152,000 on the disk
drives shown in Table 16.2, and the capacity of each track typically ranges from tens
of kilobytes to 150 Kbytes. Because a track usually contains a large amount of infor-
mation, it is divided into smaller blocks or sectors. The division of a track into
sectors is hard-coded on the disk surface and cannot be changed. One type of sector
organization, as shown in Figure 16.2(a), calls a portion of a track that subtends a
fixed angle at the center a sector. Several other sector organizations are possible,
one of which is to have the sectors subtend smaller angles at the center as one moves

°In some disks, the circles are now connected into a kind of continuous spiral.
