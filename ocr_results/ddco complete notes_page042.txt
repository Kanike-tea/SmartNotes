Three-to-eight-line decoder

Decoders with enable inputs can be connected together to form a larger decoder circuit.

Implement 4:16 decoder using 2 3:8 decoder.

two 3-to-8-line decoders with enable inputs connected to form a 4-to-16-line decoder.

When w =0, the top decoder is enabled and the other is disabled. The bottom decoder outputs
are all 0’s, and the top eight outputs generate minterms 0000 to 0111.

When w =1, the enable conditions are reversed: The bottom decoder outputs generate

minterms 1000 to 1111.
