8.5 THE DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) converts a time domain signal x, to a frequency
domain signal y;. The associated inverse transform (IDFT) reconstructs the time domain
signal from the frequency domain signal. This tool is heavily used in signal analysis and
compression. It is particularly powerful because there is an algorithm, the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT), that implements the DFT very efficiently. In this section we will look at
some efficient ARM implementations of the FFT.

The DFT acts on a frame of N complex time samples, converting them into N complex
frequency coefficients. We will use Equations (8.37) and (8.38) as the definition. You may
see slightly different equations in different texts because some authors may use a different
scaling or a different definition of which is the forward and which the inverse transform.
This doesn’t affect any of the important properties of the transform.

N-1
y = DFTN(x) means yy, = u x,wkt, where wy = e27/N (8.37)

N-1
x = IDFTN(y) means x; = vo yewht, where wy = e7!/N (8.38)

As you can see, the transforms are the same except for scaling and choice of wy.
Therefore we'll only look at the forward transform. In fact the Fast Fourier Transform
algorithm works for any wy such that wi) = 1. The algorithm is only invertible for
principal roots of unity where wk, # 1 for k< N.

8.5.1 THE FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM

The idea of the FFT is to break down the transform by factorizing N. Suppose for example
that N = R x S. Split the output into § blocks of size R and the input into R blocks of
size S. In other words:

k=nR+m_ forn=0,1,...,S—1 and m=0,1,...,R-1 (8.39)
t=rS+s forr=0,1,...,.R—1 and s=0,1,...,S—1 (8.40)
Then,
