ee P/AG = UtG or v= 45 (utd)

This is also a parabola in the w— plane symmetrical about the real axis whose vertex

isat (- é , 0) and focusat thé origin. Also theline y = —c, is transformed into the

same parabola.

Hence from these two cases we conclude that the straight lines parallel to the
co-ordinate axes in the z— plane map onto parabolas in the w— plane.

Case-3: Let us consider a circle with centre origin and radius r in the z—plane.
ie., lzl=er « zard® Hence w = 2 = (re)? :
ic, w= rei? = Rel? (say)sothat R= 7 and > = 20°

This is also a circle in the w— plane having radius ? and subtending an angle am
at the origin.

Hence we conclude that a circle with centre origin and radius r. in the z- plane mr a

onto a circle with centre origin and radius ? inthe w-plane.
