Combinational Legic
Circuits

At any instant of time, the output
is only Gependent om the current
state of the inputs.

Time ts not an important

Tis parameter

dependency

The output is solely dependent
(on Inputs only. No need ror
memory.

Easy to design and implement
witn tne neip of basic logic

Memory

Design

Differentiate between combinational logic and sequential logic

Sequential Logic Circuits

At any instant of time, the output is
determined by inputs and previous
outputs.

Time 1s an important parameter For
timing and synchronizing of different
Circuit elements, a clack signal is
necessary

Memory is required to store the
previous state of the system

The design of these systems requires
basic logic gates ana tip ops

gates.
There is no feedback. There is at least one memory
element in the recdpack patn
They are difficult to implement but

less costly than sequential circuits

Feeanac

They are easier to implement but
costly, due to hardware. Their
Implementation requires more
hardware.

ney are taster since all inputs
are applied at the same time

Hardware &
cost

They are slower, because of tne

Speea secondary inputs. So, there is a

aelay in between inputs. Ana tne
output Is gated by a clock signal.

» The storage elements (memory) used in clocked sequential circuits are
called flipflops.

> A flip-flop is a binary storage device capable of storing one bit of
information.

Storage Elements:

1)Latches:

» Latches are digital circuits that serve as basic building blocks in the

construction of sequential logic circuits.

» They are bistable, meaning they have two stable states and can be
used to store binary information. Latches are often used for

temporary storage of data within a digital system.
» There are several types of latches, with the most common being the
