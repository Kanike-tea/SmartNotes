COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

In this Addressing Mode , EA of an operand is stored in the one of the GPR‘ of the CPU. This

Addressing Mode increment the contents of memory register by 4 memory locations after operand

access.
The symbolic representation is
(Ri)+ Where R; is the one of the GPR.
Ex: MOVE (Ri)+ ,R2

This instruction transfer‘s data from the memory location whoseaddress is stored in Ri into R3

register and then it increments the contents of Ri by 4 memory locations.

Auto-Increment Addressing Mode

h. AUTO DECREMENT ADDRESSING MODE

In this Addressing Mode_, EA of.an operand is stored in the one of the GPR* of the CPU. This

Addressing Mode decrements the contents.of memory register by 4 memory locations and then

transfersithe data to destination.

The symbolic representation is
-(R1) WhereRiis the one of theGPR.
Ex: MOVE™- (Ri) ,R2
This instruction first decrements the contents of Ri by 4 memory locations and then transfer“s data

of that location to destination register.
