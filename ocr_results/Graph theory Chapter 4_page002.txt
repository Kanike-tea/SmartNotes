Step 3. Stop the process of Step 2.when.(n.— 1) edges are selected. These (n — 1) edge,
constitute a minimal spapning tree of G.
Remarks | }

(1) If two or more edges have the same weight, there will be more than one listing of: edges in
non-decreasing order of weights. Different listings may yield different minimal spanning
trees. As such, Kruskal’s algorithm does not determine a unique minimal spanning tree.

(2) The process in Step 2 is called a Greedy process.

eertee Using the Kruskal’s algorithm, find a minimal spanning tree of the weighted
graph shown below: ~

i ee j ; Figure 4.3

> We observe that the given graph has 6 vertices; hence a spanning tree thereof will have 5
edges (branches). Let us put the edges of the graph ina non- decreasing order of their weights
and successively select:5 edges in sucha way that no oyele i is creatéd. This scheme is sum™
rized in the following Table:

AB

Select? Yes

Observe that CQ is not selected because CR and QR have 2 alicads been selected aol
selection of CQ would have created'a cycle. Further, AP is not selected because it would "
created a cycle along with BP and AB which have already been selected. We have stOP!
process when exactly 5 edges are selected, AB.

~ Thus,-a minimal spanning tree of the given graph contains the five edges CR, ORB PA
CP. This tree is shown in Figure 4.4. The weight of this tree is 24 units.
