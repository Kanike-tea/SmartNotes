What is electroencephalogram (EEG)? Discuss the various applications of electroencephalogram.

Ans. EEG stands for electroencephalography, which is a non-invasive method for measuring the electrical
activity of the brain. An EEG records the electrical signals generated by the brain's neurons as they
communicate with each other. The signals are recorded through electrodes placed on the scalp and the
resulting EEG pattern provides information about the synchronized electrical activity of large populations
of neurons.

Applications of EEG

Some of the most common applications of EEG are:

+ Diagnosis of Epilepsy: EEG is a widely used tool to diagnose epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It can
detect abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the
location of the seizure focus.

* Sleep Studies: EEG is often used in sleep studies to evaluate sleep patterns an diagnose sleep disorders.
+ Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): EEG can be used to control external devices such as prosthetic limbs
or computer software. This is done by detecting specific brain waves associated with a particular mental
state, such as concentration or relaxation.

+ Research on Brain Function: EEG is used in research to study brain function during various activities
such as reading, problem-solving, and decision-making. EEG can also be used to investigate how the brain
responds to stimuli such as light, sound, and touch.

+ Diagnosis of Brain Disorders: EEG can be used to diagnose a wide range of brain disorders including
dementia, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury.

+ Anesthesia Monitoring: EEG can be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia during surgery to ensure that
the patient remains in a safe and comfortable state.

+ Monitoring Brain Activity during Coma: EEG is also used to monitor brain activity in patients who are

in a coma to determine the level of brain function and assess the likelihood of recovery.
