Expression of antigen and induction
of immune response

5. Explain the RNA vaccine structure for COVID 19.
Answer:

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Messenger RNA, or mRNA technology, instructs cells to make a protein that generates an
immune response in the body, thus producing the antibodies that provide protection against a
disease.

It is the basis for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines being used by
governments worldwide, and in the UN-supported COVAX global vaccine solidarity
initiative. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a molecule that provides cells with
instructions for making proteins. mRNA vaccines contain the instructions for making the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes
COVID-19.

The mRNA molecule is essentially a recipe, telling the cells of the body how to make the
spike protein. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are given by injection, usually into the muscle of
the upper arm. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets
rid of them. The mRNA never enters the central part (nucleus) of the cell, which is where our
DNA (genetic material) is found. Your DNA can't be altered by mRNA vaccines.

The cell then displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune system recognizes that the
protein doesn't belong there and begins building an immune response and making antibodies.
