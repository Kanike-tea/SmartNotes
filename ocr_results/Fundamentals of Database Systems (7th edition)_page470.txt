Chapter 13. XML: Extensible Markup Language

. Schema descriptions and XML namespaces. It is necessary to identify the

specific set of XML schema language elements (tags) being used by specify-
ing a file stored at a Web site location. The second line in Figure 13.5 speci-
fies the file used in this example, which is http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.
This is a commonly used standard for XML schema commands. Each such
definition is called an XML namespace because it defines the set of com-
mands (names) that can be used. The file name is assigned to the variable xsd
(XML schema description) using the attribute xmins (XML namespace), and
this variable is used as a prefix to all XML schema commands (tag names).
For example, in Figure 13.5, when we write xsd:element or xsd:sequence, we
are referring to the definitions of the element and sequence tags as defined in
the file http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.

. Annotations, documentation, and language used. The next couple of lines

in Figure 13.5 illustrate the XML schema elements (tags) xsd:annotation and
xsd:documentation, which are used for providing comments and other
descriptions in the XML document. The attribute xml:lang of the
xsd:documentation element specifies the language being used, where en stands
for the English language.

. Elements and types. Next, we specify the root element of our XML schema.

In XML schema, the name attribute of the xsd:element tag specifies the ele-
ment name, which is called company for the root element in our example (see
Figure 13.5). The structure of the company root element can then be speci-
fied, which in our example is xsd:complexType. This is further specified to be
a sequence of departments, employees, and projects using the xsd:sequence
structure of XML schema. It is important to note here that this is not the
only way to specify an XML schema for the COMPANY database. We will
discuss other options in Section 13.6.

. First-level elements in the COMPANY database. Next, we specify the three

first-level elements under the company root element in Figure 13.5. These
elements are named employee, department, and project, and each is specified
in an xsd:element tag. Notice that if a tag has only attributes and no further
subelements or data within it, it can be ended with the backslash symbol (/>)
directly instead of having a separate matching end tag. These are called
empty elements; examples are the xsd:element elements named department
and project in Figure 13.5.

. Specifying element type and minimum and maximum occurrences. In

XML schema, the attributes type, minOccurs, and maxOccurs in the xsd:element
tag specify the type and multiplicity of each element in any document that
conforms to the schema specifications. If we specify a type attribute in an
xsd:element, the structure of the element must be described separately, typi-
cally using the xsd:complexType element of XML schema. This is illustrated
by the employee, department, and project elements in Figure 13.5. On the other
hand, if no type attribute is specified, the element structure can be defined
directly following the tag, as illustrated by the company root element in Fig-
ure 13.5. The minOccurs and maxOccurs tags are used for specifying lower
