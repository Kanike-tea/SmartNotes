1014 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

still remains a challenging problem. We also commented on the analysis of audio
data sources in Section 26.4.4.

We concluded the chapter with an introduction to deductive databases in Section 26.5.
We introduced deductive databases in Section 26.5.1, and gave an overview of Prolog
and Datalog notation in Sections 26.5.2 and 26.5.3. We discussed the clausal form of
formulas in Section 26.5.4. Datalog rules are restricted to Horn clauses, which contain
at most one positive literal. We discussed the proof-theoretic and model-theoretic
interpretation of rules in Section 26.5.5. We briefly discussed the safety of Datalog rules
in Section 26.5.6 and the ways of expressing relational operators using Datalog rules in
Section 26.5.7. Finally, we discussed an inference mechanism based on relational oper-
ations that can be used to evaluate nonrecursive Datalog queries using relational query
optimization techniques in Section 26.5.8. Although Datalog has been a popular lan-
guage with some applications, implementations of deductive database systems such as
LDL or VALIDITY have not become widely commercially available.
