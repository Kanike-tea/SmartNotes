Microcontrollers-BCS402

There are no data processing instructions that directly manipulate data in memory. Thus, data
processing is carried out solely in registers.

Data items are placed in the register file—a storage bank made up of 32-bit registers. Since
the ARM core is a 32-bit processor, most instructions treat the registers as holding signed or
unsigned 32-bit values. The sign extend hardware converts signed 8-bit and 16-bit numbers to
32-bit values as they are read from memory and placed in a register.

ARM instructions typically have two source registers, Rn and Rm, and a single result or
destination register; Rd. Source operands are read from the register file using the internal
buses A and B, respectively.

The ALU (arithmetic logic unit) or MAC (multiply-accumulate unit) takes the register values
Rn and Rm from the A and B buses and computes a result. Data processing instructions write
the result in Rd directly to the register file. Load and store instructions use the ALU to
generate an address to be held in the address register and broadcast on the Address bus.

One important feature of the ARM is that register Rm alternatively can be preprocessed in the

barrel shifter before it enters the ALU. Together the barrel shifter and ALU can calculate a

wide range of expressions and addres:
After passing through the functional units, the result in Rd is written back to the register file
using the Result bus. For load and store instructions the incrementer updates the address
register before the core reads or writes the next register value from or to the next sequential
memory location.

The processor continues executing instructions until an exception or interrupt changes the

normal execution flow.

2. Registers

General-purpose registers hold either data or an address. Figure 2 shows the active registers
available in user mode which is a protected mode normally used when executing applications.
The processor can operate in seven different modes. All the registers shown are 32 bits in
size.

There are up to 18 active registers: 16 data registers and 2 processor status registers. The data
registers are visible to the programmer as r0 to r15.

The ARM processor has three registers assigned to a particular task or special function:
r13,rl4,andr15.
