Parameters of Disks

T* most important disk parameter is the time
required to locate an arbitrary disk block, given its
block address, and then to transfer the block between the disk and a main memory
buffer. This is the random access time for accessing a disk block. There are three
time components to consider as follows:

1. Seek time (s). This is the time needed to mechanically position the
read/write head on the correct track for movable-head disks. (For fixed-head
disks, it is the time needed to electronically switch to the appropriate
read/write head.) For movable-head disks, this time varies, depending on the
distance between the current track under the read/write head and the track
specified in the block address. Usually, the disk manufacturer provides an
average seek time in milliseconds. The typical range of average seek time is 4
to 10 msec. This is the main culprit for the delay involved in transferring
blocks between disk and memory.

2. Rotational delay (rd). Once the read/write head is at the correct track, the
user must wait for the beginning of the required block to rotate into position
under the read/write head. On average, this takes about the time for half a
revolution of the disk, but it actually ranges from immediate access (if
the start of the required block is in position under the read/write head right
after the seek) to a full disk revolution (if the start of the required block just
passed the read/write head after the seek). If the speed of disk rotation is p
revolutions per minute (rpm), then the average rotational delay rd is given by

rd = (1/2) * (1/p) min = (60 * 1000)/(2 * p) msec = 30000/p msec
A typical value for p is 10,000 rpm, which gives a rotational delay of rd =
3 msec. For fixed-head disks, where the seek time is negligible, this component
causes the greatest delay in transferring a disk block.
