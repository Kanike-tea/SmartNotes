Suppose that we used EMP_PROJ1 and EMP_LOCS as the base relations instead of
EMP_PROJ. This produces a particularly bad schema design because we cannot
recover the information that was originally in EMP_PROJ from EMP_PROJ1 and
EMP_LOCS. If we attempt a NATURAL JOIN operation on EMP_PROJ1 and
EMP_LOCS, the result produces many more tuples than the original set of tuples
in EMP_PROJ. In Figure 14.6, the result of applying the join to only the tuples for
employee with Ssn = “123456789” is shown (to reduce the size of the resulting rela-
tion). Additional tuples that were not in EMP_PROJ are called spurious tuples
because they represent spurious information that is not valid. The spurious
tuples are marked by asterisks (*) in Figure 14.6. It is left to the reader to complete
the result of NATURAL JOIN operation on the EMP_PROJ1 and EMP_LOCS
tables in their entirety and to mark the spurious tuples in this result.
