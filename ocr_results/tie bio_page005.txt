in a person’s nucleated cells with that identified in biological matter found at the scene of a

7. Define proteins. Briefly explain the different types of plant and animal based proteins.
Answer:

Protein is found throughout the body—in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other
body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the
hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood.

Talking more about proteins based on biomolecule concept, Proteins are large biomolecules
and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues.

Protein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein every
day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Because protein is found in an abundance of foods,
many people can easily meet this goal. However, not all protein “packages” are created equal.
Because foods contain a lot more than protein, it’s important to pay attention to what else is
coming with it.

Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of
complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often
lack one or more essential amino acid. Whey protein is a mixture of proteins isolated from
whey, the liquid material created as a by- product of cheese production. The proteins consist
of a-lactalbumin, B-lactoglobulin, serum albumin and immunoglobulins. Glycomacropeptide
also makes up the third largest component but is not a protein. Whey protein is commonly
marketed as a protein supplement, and various health claims have been attributed to it.

Meat analogues find raising interest of many consumers who are looking for indulgent,
healthy, low environmental impact, ethical, cost-effective, and/or new food products. High
moisture extrusion cooking enables the production of fresh, premium meat analogues that are
texturally like muscle meat from plant or animal proteins.

Plant protein is simply a meaningful food source of protein which is from plants. This group
can include pulses, tofu, soya, tempeh, seitan, nuts, seeds, certain grains and even peas.
