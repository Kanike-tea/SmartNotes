ALGORITHM SPECIFICATION

An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that, if followed, accomplishes a particular task. In
addition, all algorithms must satisfy the following criteria:

1. Input: There are zero or more quantities that are externally supplied.

2. Output: At least one quantity is produced.

3. Definiteness: Each instruction is clear and unambiguous

4. Finiteness: If we trace out the instructions of an algorithm, then for all cases, the
algorithm terminates after a finite number of steps.

5. Effectiveness: Every instruction must be basic enough to be carried out, in principle,
by a person using only pencil and paper. It is not enough that each operation be
definite as in (3); it also must be feasible.

Algorithm can be described in following ways:

1) We can use natural language consisting of some mathematical equations.
2) We can use graphic representations such as flowcharts.

3) We can use combination of C and English language.constructs.

¢ Algorithm 1.1: Selection sort algorithm.

for (i=0;i<n;i++)

{
Examine list[i] to list[n-1] and suppose that the
smallest integer is,at list[min]; Interchange list[i]
and list[min];

}

Algorithm 1.2: finding the smallest integer.

assume that minimum is list[i]
compare current minimum with list[it+l] to list[n-1] and find
smaller number and make it the new minimum

¢ Algorithm 1.3: Binary search.

Assume that we have n> | distinct integers that are already sorted and stored in the array list.
That is, list{0]<= list[1]...list{n]

We must figure out if an integer searchnum is in this list.

If it is we should return an index, i, such that list[i] = searchnum.

Ifsearchnum is not present, we should return -1.

Since the list is sorted we may use the following method to search for the value. Let left and

right, respectively, denote the left and right ends of the list to be searched. Initially, left = 0
