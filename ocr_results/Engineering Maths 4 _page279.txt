favourable cases to an-event E£, then the probability of the happening of the event
E, usually denoted by P(E) orsimply: p is defined to be equal to m/n.
That is, P(E) =p= number of favourable cases _m .

: number of ‘possible cases n
The probability can atmost be equalto 1, because the number of favourable cases and
the number of possible cases cai atmost coincide with each other. :
Since m cases are favourable to the. event, it follows that (n—m) -cases are not
favourable to the event. This set of unfavourable events is denoted by E or.E’

Therefore probability of the non happening of the event usually denoted by q is
given by ; . , a

n- = nem in’ af
q= 7 or Phe ea Pe,

ie, q=1-"e1-p or pt+q=1

Equivalently P(E)+P(E) =1

p_is also referred to as the probability of success and q_ as the probability of failure.

Their sum is always equal to 1.

If P(E) =1, E iscalledasureevent & if P(E) =0,E iscalléd animpossible event.
