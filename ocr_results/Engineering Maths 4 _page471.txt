The given equation can be written in the form = -y =x which is a linear
differential equation of the form = + Py = Q whose exact solution is given by :

y el Pit = fe Pit de 4c ;
J Pax ex je

Here, P=-1, Q.=x. ca wehave e

The solution is, ye* = fze* dtc

Integrating RHS by parts, we obtain, ,
ye*=x(-€*) - (1) (€*) +6

or ye*=-xe*-e* +e 7

Multiplying by e*, wehave y=-x-1+ ce.

Using the initial condition y = 1 at x = 0 in the solution we have
1=-0-1+te . ¢c=2.- ‘ ,

Substituting this value of c , the exact ( analytical or ‘theoretical #) sohition i is given sale

y=2e&-x-1 ,

Now using the series expansion of Ps f a = +3, oa the solution _
becomes, :

Comparing this with our fount pprexinenany

we observe that y, approximates to the exact solution upto the term inz’

Also by putting x = : 0.1 and 0.2 in the exact solution y= ae =~ We eae

y(01)=2e4- 01-15 1.103418
y(0.2)=2e?-02-15 1,2428055

These theoretical’values agrees with the values obtained from the fourth
approximation, in the numerical method.
