e The occipital lobes are vital for being able to see clearly.

Both CPU and brain use electrical signals to send messages. The brain uses chemicals to
transmit information; the computer uses electricity. Even though electrical signals travel at
high speeds in the nervous system, they travel even faster through the wires in a computer.
Both transmit information.

A BCI system is a computer-based system that takes brain signals, analyses them and
translates them into commands that are relayed to a device to trigger a desired action. A BCI
system does not use peripheral nerves and head muscles. The CNS (Central Nervous
System), for example, is used to measure signals produced by the central nervous system.
Thus, for example, a sensor that is activated by the voice or the movement of a muscle is not
a BCI system. Also an EEG is not BCI itself, because it only records brain signals but it does
not produce an output that acts on the user's environment. It is also wrong to think that BCI is
a mind-reader.

. Explain the central nervous system of the brain.

Answer:

CNS includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain is the body’s “control center.” The CNS
has various centers located within it that carry out the sensory, motor and integration of data.
These centers can be subdivided to Lower Centers (including the spinal cord and brain stem)
and higher centers communicating with the brain via effectors.

In terms of tissue, the CNS is divided into grey matter and white matter. Grey matter
comprises neuron cell bodies and their dendrites, glial cells, and capillaries. Because of the
abundant blood supply of this tissue, it’s actually more pink-coloured than grey.

In the brain, grey matter is mainly found in the outer layers, while in the spinal cord it forms
the core ‘butterfly’ shape.

White matter refers to the areas of the CNS which host the majority of axons, the long cords
that extend from neurons. Most axons are coated in myelin - a white, fatty insulating cover
that helps nerve signals travel quickly and reliably. In the brain, white matter is buried under
the grey surface, carrying signals across different parts of the brain. In the spinal cord, white
matter is the external layer surrounding the grey core.

The CNS is the processing center of the body and consists of the brain and the spinal cord.
Both of these are protected by three layers of membranes known as meninges. For further
protection, the brain is encased within the hard bones of the skull, while the spinal cord is
protected with the bony vertebrae of our backbones. A third form of protection is
cerebrospinal fluid, which provides a buffer that limits impact between the brain and skull or
between spinal cord and vertebrae.
