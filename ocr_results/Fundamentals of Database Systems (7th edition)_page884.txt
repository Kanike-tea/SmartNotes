23.3 Overview of Concurrency Control
and Recovery in Distributed Databases

For concurrency control and recovery purposes, numerous problems arise in a dis-
tributed DBMS environment that are not encountered in a centralized DBMS envi-
ronment. These include the following:

= Dealing with multiple copies of the data items. The concurrency control
method is responsible for maintaining consistency among these copies. The
recovery method is responsible for making a copy consistent with other cop-
ies if the site on which the copy is stored fails and recovers later.

= Failure of individual sites. The DDBMS should continue to operate with its
running sites, if possible, when one or more individual sites fail. When a site
recovers, its local database must be brought up-to-date with the rest of the
sites before it rejoins the system.

= Failure of communication links. The system must be able to deal with the
failure of one or more of the communication links that connect the sites. An
extreme case of this problem is that network partitioning may occur. This
breaks up the sites into two or more partitions, where the sites within each
partition can communicate only with one another and not with sites in other
partitions.

= Distributed commit. Problems can arise with committing a transaction
that is accessing databases stored on multiple sites if some sites fail during
the commit process. The two-phase commit protocol (see Section 21.6) is
often used to deal with this problem.

= Distributed deadlock. Deadlock may occur among several sites, so
techniques for dealing with deadlocks must be extended to take this
into account.

Distributed concurrency control and recovery techniques must deal with these
and other problems. In the following subsections, we review some of the tech-
niques that have been suggested to deal with recovery and concurrency control
in DDBMSs.

23.3.1 Distributed Concurrency Control Based
on a Distinguished Copy of a Data Item

To deal with replicated data items in a distributed database, a number of concur-
rency control methods have been proposed that extend the concurrency control
techniques that are used in centralized databases. We discuss these techniques in
the context of extending centralized locking. Similar extensions apply to other con-
currency control techniques. The idea is to designate a particular copy of each data
item as a distinguished copy. The locks for this data item are associated with the
distinguished copy, and all locking and unlocking requests are sent to the site that
contains that copy.
