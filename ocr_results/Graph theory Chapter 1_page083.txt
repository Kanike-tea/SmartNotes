The following Theorems contain some basic properties of Euler graphs.

Proof: First, suppose that G has an Euler circuit. While tracing this circuit we observe that
every time the circuit meets a vertex v it goes through two edges incident on v (— with the one
through which we enter v and the other through which we depart from v). This is true for
vertices that belong to the circuit. Since the circuit contains all edges, it meets all the vertic
at least once. Therefore, the degree of every vertex is a multiple of two (i.e. every vertex is
even degree),
Conversely, suppose that all the vertices of G are of even degree. Now, we construct
Circuit starting at an arbitrary vertex v and going through the edges of G such that no edge
traced more than once. Since every vertex is of even degree, we can depart from every v
we enter, and the tracing cannot stop at any vertex other than y. In this way, we obtain a ci
q having v as the initial and final vertex. If this circuit contains all the edges in G, then th
circuit is an Euler circuit. If not, let us consider the subgraph H obtained by removing fro
all edges that belong to g. The degrees of vertices in this subgraph are also even. Since
connected, the circuit q and the subgraph H must have at least one vertex, say v’, in com

Starting from v’, we can Construct a circuit q’ in H as was done in G. The two circuits q
together constitute a circuit which starts and ends at the vertex v and has more edges than @:
this circuit contains all the edges in G, then the circuit is an Euler circuit. Otherwise, we

the Process until we get a circuit that starts from v and ends at v and which contains all
in G. In this way, we obtain an Buler circuit in G,

This completes the Proof of the theorem,
