we cannot infer the instances of CAN_TEACH; therefore, TAUGHT_DURING and
OFFERED_DURING are redundant and can be left out.

Although in general three binary relationships cannot replace a ternary relation-
ship, they may do so under certain additional constraints. In our example, if the
CAN_TEACH relationship is 1:1 (an instructor can teach only one course, and a
course can be taught by only one instructor), then the ternary relationship OFFERS
can be left out because it can be inferred from the three binary relationships
CAN_TEACH, TAUGHT_DURING, and OFFERED_DURING. The schema designer
must analyze the meaning of each specific situation to decide which of the binary
and ternary relationship types are needed.

Notice that it is possible to have a weak entity type with a ternary (or n-ary) identi-
fying relationship type. In this case, the weak entity type can have several owner
entity types. An example is shown in Figure 3.19. This example shows part of a
database that keeps track of candidates interviewing for jobs at various companies,
which may be part of an employment agency database. In the requirements, a can-
didate can have multiple interviews with the same company (for example, with dif-
ferent company departments or on separate dates), but a job offer is made based on
one of the interviews. Here, INTERVIEW is represented as a weak entity with two
owners CANDIDATE and COMPANY, and with the partial key Dept_date. An
INTERVIEW entity is uniquely identified by a candidate, a company, and the combi-
nation of the date and department of the interview.

3.9.2 Constraints on Ternary (or Higher-Degree)
Relationships

There are two notations for specifying structural constraints on n-ary relationships,
and they specify different constraints. They should thus both be used if it is impor-
tant to fully specify the structural constraints on a ternary or higher-degree rela-
tionship. The first notation is based on the cardinality ratio notation of binary
relationships displayed in Figure 3.2. Here, a 1, M, or N is specified on each
