(1) mean proportion of successes = lide p
n
(2) SDorS.E proportion of successes = 2 = lpq/n

n

Let x be the observed number of successes in a sample size of n and jt = np be the

expected number of successes. Let the associated standard normal variateZ be defined
by © :

sal So

“6  Vnpq

If | Z| > 2.58 we conclude that the difference is hi; significant and reject the

hypothesis. Since p is the probability of success and Vpq/n is the S.E moan of
successes, p + 2.58 V pq/n are the probable limits.

© Test of significance for difference of means
Let My and 1) be the mean of two populations.

Let (ay 01); (Se Oy) be the mean and S.D of two large samples of size ny and : art ;
Ny respectively. We wish to test the null hypothesis Hy that there is no difference ~~ °-

between the population means. That is Hy: 'y = Ho.
The statistic for this test is given by
(4-%)
~ Vo4/n, + 02/ny.
Also confidence limits for the difference of means of the population i
(47%) + 2Not/n, + Bt

We adopt the same procedure for testing the null hypothesis by using one tailed test
or two tailed test.

Corollary: If the samples are drawn from the same population then 6, = 6) = o
(%-%)

~ oN(/n,+V/n,)

¢ — Test of significance for difference of Properties (attributes) for two
samples

Let p, and p, be the sample sip te in respect of an attribute corresponding to two

large samples of size n, and n, drawn from two populations.
