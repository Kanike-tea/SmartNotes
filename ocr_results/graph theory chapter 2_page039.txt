> We observe that the given graph G is a path of length n =

5, namely Ls. Therefore, is
chromatic polynomial is :

PG,a) = P(Ls,a) = Aa = 1).

Next, we note that the given graph cannot be properly coloured with one colour but ca
properly coloured with 2 colours by assigning two colours to the alternative vertices, Therefore
the chomatic number of the graph is X(G) = 2. i

Find the chromatic number and the chromatic polynomial for the graph K,,,
> We note that Ki, is the complete bipartite graph wherein one bipartite of the Vertex set

“has only one vertex, say v, and the other bipartite has n vertices, SAY V1, V2,...,U_, A Proper
colouring of this graph cannot be done with just one colour,and but can be done with two
colours - by assigning one colour to v and another colour to all of Vis V2sse05 Vas Thus, the
chromatic number of this graph is 2.

If A colours are available, then. the vertex: v can be coloured in 2 ways and each of the
vertices vy, v2, ..,

Consider the 8raph K>3 shown in Figure 2.48. Let Q denote the number of
colours available to Properly colour the vertices of this graph..Find:
