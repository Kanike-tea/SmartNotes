Chapter 13. XML: Extensible Markup Language

Basic HTML is useful for generating static Web pages with fixed text and other
objects, but most e-commerce applications require Web pages that provide interac-
tive features with the user and use the information provided by the user for select-
ing specific data from a database for display. Such Web pages are called dynamic
Web pages, because the data extracted and displayed each time will be different
depending on user input. For example, a banking app would get the user’s account
number, then extract the balance for that user’s account from the database for dis-
play. We discussed how scripting languages, such as PHP, can be used to generate
dynamic Web pages for applications such as those presented in Chapter 11. XML
can be used to transfer information in self-describing textual files among various
programs on different computers when needed by the applications.

In this chapter, we will focus on describing the XML data model and its associated
languages, and how data extracted from relational databases can be formatted as
XML documents to be exchanged over the Web. Section 13.1 discusses the differ-
ence among structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. Section 13.2 pres-
ents the XML data model, which is based on tree (hierarchical) structures as
compared to the flat relational data model structures. In Section 13.3, we focus on
the structure of XML documents and the languages for specifying the structure of
these documents, such as DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML Schema.
Section 13.4 shows the relationship between XML and relational databases. Sec-
tion 13.5 describes some of the languages associated with XML, such as XPath and
XQuery. Section 13.6 discusses how data extracted from relational databases can be
formatted as XML documents. In Section 13.7, we discuss the new functions that
have been incorporated into XML for the purpose of generating XML documents
from relational databases. Finally, Section 13.8 is the chapter summary.

13.1 Structured, Semistructured,
and Unstructured Data

The information stored in relational databases is known as structured data because
it is represented in a strict format. For example, each record in a relational database
table—such as each of the tables in the COMPANY database in Figure 5.6—follows
the same format as the other records. For structured data, it is common to carefully
design the database schema using techniques such as those described in Chapters 3
and 4 in order to define the database structure. The DBMS then checks to ensure
that all data follows the structures and constraints specified in the schema.

However, not all data is collected and inserted into carefully designed structured
databases. In some applications, data is collected in an ad hoc manner before it is
known how it will be stored and managed. This data may have a certain structure,
but not all the information collected will have the identical structure. Some attri-
butes may be shared among the various entities, but other attributes may exist only
in a few entities. Moreover, additional attributes can be introduced in some of the
newer data items at any time, and there is no predefined schema. This type of data
is known as semistructured data. A number of data models have been introduced
