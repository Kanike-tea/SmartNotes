27.5 Inverted Indexing

term occurs. The simplest form of vocabulary terms consists of words or individual
tokens of the documents. In some cases, these vocabulary terms also consist of
phrases, n-grams, entities, links, names, dates, or manually assigned descriptor
terms from documents and/or Web pages. For each term in the vocabulary, the cor-
responding document id’s, occurrence locations of the term in each document,
number of occurrences of the term in each document, and other relevant informa-
tion may be stored in the document information section.

Weights are assigned to document terms to represent an estimate of the usefulness
of the given term as a descriptor for distinguishing the given document from other
documents in the same collection. A term may be a better descriptor of one docu-
ment than of another by the weighting process (see Section 27.2).

An inverted index of a document collection is a data structure that attaches distinct
terms with a list of all documents that contains the term. The process of inverted
index construction involves the extraction and processing steps shown in Fig-
ure 27.2. Acquired text is first preprocessed and the documents are represented
with the vocabulary terms. Documents’ statistics are collected in document lookup
tables. Statistics generally include counts of vocabulary terms in individual docu-
ments as well as different collections, their positions of occurrence within the docu-
ments, and the lengths of the documents. The vocabulary terms are weighted at
indexing time according to different criteria for collections. For example, in some
cases terms in the titles of the documents may be weighted more heavily than terms
that occur in other parts of the documents.

One of the most popular weighting schemes is the TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse
document frequency) metric that we described in Section 27.2. For a given term,
this weighting scheme distinguishes to some extent the documents in which the
term occurs more often from those in which the term occurs very little or never.
These weights are normalized to account for varying document lengths, further
ensuring that longer documents with proportionately more occurrences of a word
are not favored for retrieval over shorter documents with proportionately fewer
occurrences. These processed document-term streams (matrices) are then inverted
into term-document streams (matrices) for further IR steps.

Figure 27.4 shows an illustration of term-document-position vectors for the four
illustrative terms—example, inverted, index, and market—which shows the posi-
tions where each term occurs in the three documents.

The steps involved in inverted index construction can be summarized as follows:

1. Break the documents into vocabulary terms by tokenizing, cleansing, remov-
ing stopwords, stemming, and/or using an additional thesaurus as vocabulary.

2. Collect document statistics and store the statistics in a document lookup
table.

3. Invert the document-term stream into a term-document stream along with
additional information such as term frequencies, term positions, and term
weights.
