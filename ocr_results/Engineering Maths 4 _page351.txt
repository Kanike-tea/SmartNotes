*. Marginal probability distributions .

In the joint probability table, f (a f(E) FF (Xp ) respectively represents the -
th

sum of all the entries in the first row, -second row, le. am row.
8(%)+ 8(Y2)**°8(Y,) Tespectively represents the sum of all the entries in the fitst
column, second’column,... 2 column.

are called marginal probability: distributions of. X and Y respectively. (Since, these _
values are from the margins of the table the word “wiicgingl 8 is being used) -"

¢ Independent random variables
The discrete random variables X and Y.are said to be-independent random

variables if
P(X=x,Y=y)=P(X=x)-P(Y=y) and conversely.

Thatis P(X =x,, Y= yj) = P(X= x) -P(Y= 4).
This is equivalent to, F(x) 8Cy) = ij in the joint probability lable.

That is to say that X and Y are independent if each entry Jj; in the table is equal 2s

to the product of its marginal entries. Otherwise X and Y are, »said tobe dependent:
