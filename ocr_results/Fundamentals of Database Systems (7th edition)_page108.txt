Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

MANAGES relationship type is partial, meaning that some or part of the set of
employee entities are related to some department entity via MANAGES, but not
necessarily all. We will refer to the cardinality ratio and participation constraints,
taken together, as the structural constraints of a relationship type.

In ER diagrams, total participation (or existence dependency) is displayed as a double
line connecting the participating entity type to the relationship, whereas partial par-
ticipation is represented by a single line (see Figure 3.2). Notice that in this notation,
we can either specify no minimum (partial participation) or a minimum of one (total
participation). An alternative notation (see Section 3.7.4) allows the designer to spec-
ify a specific minimum number on participation in the relationship, such as 4 or 5.

We will discuss constraints on higher-degree relationships in Section 3.9.

3.4.4 Attributes of Relationship Types

Relationship types can also have attributes, similar to those of entity types. For
example, to record the number of hours per week that a particular employee works
on a particular project, we can include an attribute Hours for the WORKS_ON
relationship type in Figure 3.13. Another example is to include the date on which
a manager started managing a department via an attribute Start_date for the
MANAGES relationship type in Figure 3.12.

Notice that attributes of 1:1 or 1:N relationship types can be migrated to one of the
participating entity types. For example, the Start_date attribute for the MANAGES
relationship can be an attribute of either EMPLOYEE (manager) or DEPARTMENT,
although conceptually it belongs to MANAGES. This is because MANAGES is a 1:1
relationship, so every department or employee entity participates in at most one
relationship instance. Hence, the value of the Start_date attribute can be determined
separately, either by the participating department entity or by the participating
employee (manager) entity.

For a 1:N relationship type, a relationship attribute can be migrated only to the
entity type on the N-side of the relationship. For example, in Figure 3.9, if the
WORKS_FOR relationship also has an attribute Start_date that indicates when an
employee started working for a department, this attribute can be included as an
attribute of EMPLOYEE. This is because each employee works for at most one
department, and hence participates in at most one relationship instance in
WORKS_FOR, but a department can have many employees, each with a different start date.
In both 1:1 and 1:N relationship types, the decision where to place a relationship
attribute—as a relationship type attribute or as an attribute of a participating entity
type—is determined subjectively by the schema designer.

For M:N (many-to-many) relationship types, some attributes may be determined.
by the combination of participating entities in a relationship instance, not by any
single entity. Such attributes must be specified as relationship attributes. An example
is the Hours attribute of the M:N relationship WORKS_ON (Figure 3.13); the number
of hours per week an employee currently works on a project is determined by an
employee-project combination and not separately by either entity.
