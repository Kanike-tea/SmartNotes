Above figures represents block diagram ,truth table and implementation using basic gates of
4:1 multiplexer.

4x1 Multiplexer has four data inputs IO, I1, 12 & I3, two selection lines SO & S1 and one output Y. One of
these 4 inputs will be connected to the output based on the combination of inputs present at these two
selection lines.
