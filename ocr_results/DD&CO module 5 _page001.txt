SINGLE BUS ORGANIZATION

¢ Here the processor contain only a single bus for the movement of data, address and
instructions.
¢ ALU and all the registers are interconnected via a Single Common Bus (Figure 7.1).
¢ Data & address lines of the external memory-bus is connected to the internal
processor-bus via MDR & MAR respectively.

(MDR -> Memory Data Register, MAR -> Memory Address Register).
e¢MDR has 2 inputs and 2 outputs. Data may be loaded
— into MDR either from memory-bus (external) or
— from processor-bus (internal).
¢ MAR'’s input is connected to internal-bus; MAR's output is connected to external-
bus. (address sent from processor to memory only)

¢Instruction Decoder & Control Unit is responsible for

— Decoding the instruction and issuing the control-signals to all the units inside the
processor.

— implementing the actions specified by the instruction (loaded in the IR).

¢ Processor Registers - Register RO through R(n-1) are also called as General
Purpose Register.
The programmer can access these registers for general-purpose use.
