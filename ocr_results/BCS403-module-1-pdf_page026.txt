Database Management System [BCS403]

« Database storage reorganization: used to reorganize a set of database files into different
file organizations, and create new access paths to improve performance.

= Performance monitoring: monitors database usage and provides statistics to the DBA. The
DBA uses the statistics in making decisions such as whether or not to reorganize files or

whether to add or drop indexes to improve performance.

Other utilities may be available for sorting files, handling data compression, monitoring

access by users, interfacing with the network, and performing other functions.

2.4.3 Tools, Application Environments, and Communications Facilities

> Tools
= CASE: used in the design phase of database systems

= Data dictionary : In addition to storing catalog information about schemas and
constraints, the data dictionary stores other information, suchas design decisions,
usage standards, application program descriptions, and. user information. Such a
system is also called an information repository. This information can be accessed
directly by users or the DBA when needed.
> Application development environments
= PowerBuilder (Sybase) or JBuilder (Borland): provide an environment for
developing database applications including database design, GUI evelopment, querying
and updating, and application program development.
= Communications software: allow users at locations remote from the database system
site to access the database through computer terminals, workstations, or personal
computers. Integrated DBMS and data communications system is called a DB/DC
system
