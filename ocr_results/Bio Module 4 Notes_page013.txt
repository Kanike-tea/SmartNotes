based photovoltaic cells.

e = Thin-film photovoltaic cells: Thin-film photovoltaic cells are a type of photovoltaic cell
that uses a thin layer of material, such as silicon or cadmium telluride, to convert light
energy into electrical energy. They are lighter and more flexible than traditional silicon-
based photovoltaic cells and are ideal for use in portable and flexible solar panels.

e Concentrator photovoltaic cells: Concentrator photovoltaic cells are a type of photovoltaic
cell that uses a lens or mirror to concentrate sunlight onto a small area, increasing the
amount of light energy that can be captured and converted into electrical energy.

e = Multi-junction photovoltaic cells: multi-junction photovoltaic cells are a type of
photovoltaic cell that uses multiple layers of different materials, each optimized for
different wavelengths of light, to convert light energy into electrical energy. They are
highly efficient and ideal for use in concentrated solar power systems.

These are just a few examples of the new technologies in photovoltaic cells. The field of
photovoltaics is constantly evolving, and there are many ongoing efforts to develop new and
improved photovoltaic cell designs and materials that are more efficient, affordable, and
environmentally friendly.

4.2.2 Bionic Leaf

A bionic leaf is a system that uses artificial photosynthesis to convert sunlight into usable
forms of energy, such as hydrogen or other biofuels. The bionic leaf is designed to mimic the
process of photosynthesis in plants, where light energy is used to split water molecules into
hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydrogen can then be used as a source of energy.

The bionic leaf consists of a photovoltaic cell that captures sunlight and converts it into
electrical energy, and a catalyst, such as a bacteria, that uses the electrical energy to split water
molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen produced by the bionic leaf can then be
stored and used as a source of energy for a variety of applications, such as powering vehicles or
generating electricity.

The bionic leaf has the potential to be a highly sustainable and environmentally friendly
energy source, as it uses renewable resources, such as sunlight and water, to produce energy.
Additionally, the bionic leaf can be used in remote locations where there is limited access to
electricity, and it can help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of
climate change.

Components of Bionic Leaf

A bionic leaf is a biohybrid system that mimics the natural process of photosynthesis to
convert sunlight into chemical energy. It typically consists of several key components that work
together to facilitate this conversion. Here are the main components of a bionic leaf:

e Photosynthetic Organism: The bionic leaf utilizes a photosynthetic organism, such as a
cyanobacterium or a genetically modified plant, as the primary component. This
organism contains chlorophyll or other light-absorbing pigments that capture solar energy
and initiate the photosynthetic process.

e Light Harvesting System: The bionic leaf includes a light harvesting system, which can
