Two-Level Implementation

The implementation of Boolean functions with NAND gates requires that the functions be in sum-of-
products form. To see the relationship between a sum-of-products expression and its equivalent NAND
implementation, consider the logic diagrams drawn in Fig below. All three diagrams are equivalent and
implement the function
F=AB+CD

The function is implemented in Fig.(a) with AND and OR gates. In Fig(b), the AND gates are replaced
by NAND gates and the OR gate is replaced by a NAND gate with an OR-invert graphic symbol.
Remember that a bubble denotes complementation and two bubbles along the same line represent double
complementation, so both can be removed. Removing the bubbles on the gates of (b) produces the circuit
of (a). Therefore, the two diagrams implement the same function and are equivalent. In Fig.(c), the output

NAND gate is redrawn with the AND-invert graphic symbol.

F = ((AB)'(CD)')' = AB + CD

Three ways to implement F = AB + CD

e Implement the following Boolean function with NAND gates: F (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)

The first step is to simplify the function into sum-of-products form. This is done by means of the map
of Fig.(a), from which the simplified function is obtained: F = xy' + x'y + z The two-level NAND
implementation is shown in Fig.(b) in mixed notation. Note that input z must have a one-input NAND
gate (an inverter) to compensate for the bubble in the second-level gate. An alternative way of drawing
the logic diagram is given in Fig.(c). Here, all the NAND gates are drawn with the same graphic symbol.

The inverter with input z has been removed, but the input variable is complemented and denoted by z'.
