Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques

time, and changes to existing techniques are incorporated into newer system ver-
sions and languages. An additional difficulty in presenting this topic is that although
there are SQL standards, these standards themselves are continually evolving, and
each DBMS vendor may have some variations from the standard. Because of this,
we have chosen to give an introduction to some of the main types of database pro-
gramming techniques and to compare these techniques, rather than study one par-
ticular method or system in detail. The examples we give serve to illustrate the main
differences that a programmer would face when using each of these database pro-
gramming techniques. We will try to use the SQL standards in our examples rather
than describe a specific system. When using a specific system, the materials in this
chapter can serve as an introduction, but should be augmented with the system
manuals or with books describing the specific system.

We start our presentation of database programming in Section 10.1 with an over-
view of the different techniques developed for accessing a database from programs.
Then, in Section 10.2, we discuss the rules for embedding SQL statements into a
general-purpose programming language, generally known as embedded SQL. This
section also briefly discusses dynamic SQL, in which queries can be dynamically
constructed at runtime, and presents the basics of the SQL] variation of embedded
SQL that was developed specifically for the programming language Java. In Sec-
tion 10.3, we discuss the technique known as SQL/CLI (Call Level Interface), in which
a library of procedures and functions is provided for accessing the database. Various
sets of library functions have been proposed. The SQL/CLI set of functions is the
one given in the SQL standard. Another widely used library of functions is ODBC
(Open Data Base Connectivity), which has many similarities to SQL/CLI; in fact,
SQL/CLI can be thought of as the standardized version of ODBC. A third library of
classes—which we do describe—is JDBC; this was developed specifically for access-
ing databases from the Java object-oriented programming language (OOPL). In
OOPL, a library of classes is used instead of a library of functions and procedures,
and each class has its own operations and functions. In Section 10.4 we discuss
SQL/PSM (Persistent Stored Modules), which is a part of the SQL standard that
allows program modules—procedures and functions—to be stored by the DBMS
and accessed through SQL; this also specifies a procedural database programming
language for writing the persistent stored modules. We briefly compare the three
approaches to database programming in Section 10.5, and provide a chapter sum-
mary in Section 10.6.

10.1 Overview of Database Programming
Techniques and Issues

We now turn our attention to the techniques that have been developed for access-
ing databases from programs and, in particular, to the issue of how to access SQL
databases from application programs. Our presentation of SQL in Chapters 6 and 7
focused on the language constructs for various database operations—from schema
definition and constraint specification to querying, updating, and specifying views.
