Alternative Diagrammatic
Notations for ER Models

Frise A.1 shows a number of different diagram-
matic notations for representing ER and EER
model concepts. Unfortunately, there is no standard notation: different database
design practitioners prefer different notations. Similarly, various CASE (computer-
aided software engineering) tools and OOA (object-oriented analysis) methodolo-
gies use various notations. Some notations are associated with models that have
additional concepts and constraints beyond those of the ER and EER models
described in Chapters 7 through 9, while other models have fewer concepts and
constraints. The notation we used in Chapter 7 is quite close to the original notation
for ER diagrams, which is still widely used. We discuss some alternate notations
here.

Figure A.1(a) shows different notations for displaying entity types/classes, attri-
butes, and relationships. In Chapters 7 through 9, we used the symbols marked (i) in
Figure A.1(a)—namely, rectangle, oval, and diamond. Notice that symbol (ii) for
entity types/classes, symbol (ii) for attributes, and symbol (ii) for relationships are
similar, but they are used by different methodologies to represent three different
concepts. The straight line symbol (iii) for representing relationships is used by
several tools and methodologies.

Figure A.1(b) shows some notations for attaching attributes to entity types. We used
notation (i). Notation (ii) uses the third notation (iii) for attributes from Figure A.1(a).
The last two notations in Figure A.1(b)—(iii) and (iv)—are popular in OOA meth-
odologies and in some CASE tools. In particular, the last notation displays both the
attributes and the methods of a class, separated by a horizontal line.
