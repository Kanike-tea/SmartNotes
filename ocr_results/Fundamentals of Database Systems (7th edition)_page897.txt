23.6 Types of Distributed Database Systems

a third an object DBMS (such as Object Design’s ObjectStore) or hierarchical
DBMS (such as IBM’s IMS); in such a case, it is necessary to have a canonical system
language and to include language translators to translate subqueries from the
canonical language to the language of each server.

We briefly discuss the issues affecting the design of FDBSs next.

23.6.1 Federated Database Management Systems Issues

The type of heterogeneity present in FDBSs may arise from several sources. We
discuss these sources first and then point out how the different types of autonomies
contribute to a semantic heterogeneity that must be resolved in a heterogeneous
FDBS.

= Differences in data models. Databases in an organization come from a vari-
ety of data models, including the so-called legacy models (hierarchical and
network), the relational data model, the object data model, and even files.
The modeling capabilities of the models vary. Hence, to deal with them uni-
formly via a single global schema or to process them in a single language is
challenging. Even if two databases are both from the RDBMS environment,
the same information may be represented as an attribute name, as a relation
name, or as a value in different databases. This calls for an intelligent query-
processing mechanism that can relate information based on metadata.

= Differences in constraints. Constraint facilities for specification and imple-
mentation vary from system to system. There are comparable features that
must be reconciled in the construction of a global schema. For example, the
relationships from ER models are represented as referential integrity con-
straints in the relational model. Triggers may have to be used to implement
certain constraints in the relational model. The global schema must also deal
with potential conflicts among constraints.

= Differences in query languages. Even with the same data model, the lan-
guages and their versions vary. For example, SQL has multiple versions like
SQL-89, SQL-92, SQL-99, and SQL:2008, and each system has its own set of
data types, comparison operators, string manipulation features, and so on.

Semantic Heterogeneity. Semantic heterogeneity occurs when there are differ-
ences in the meaning, interpretation, and intended use of the same or related data.
Semantic heterogeneity among component database systems (DBSs) creates the
biggest hurdle in designing global schemas of heterogeneous databases. The design
autonomy of component DBSs refers to their freedom of choosing the following
design parameters; the design parameters in turn affect the eventual complexity of
the FDBS:

= The universe of discourse from which the data is drawn. For example, for
two customer accounts, databases in the federation may be from the United
States and Japan and have entirely different sets of attributes about customer
accounts required by the accounting practices. Currency rate fluctuations
