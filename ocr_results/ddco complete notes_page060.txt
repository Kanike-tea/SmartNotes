D latch(transparent latch)

A D latch can store a bit value, either 1 or 0. When its Enable pin is HIGH, the value
on the D pin will be stored on the Q output.

The D Latch is a logic circuit most frequently used for storing data in digital systems.
It is based on the S-R latch, but it doesn’t have an “undefined” or “invalid” state
problem.

Dlatch

One way to eliminate the undesirable condition of the indeterminate state in the
SR latch is to ensure that inputs S and R are never equal to 1 at the same time.
This is done in the D latch, shown in Fig. 5.6 . This latch has only two inputs: D
(data) and En (enable). The D input goes directly to the S input, and its
complement is applied to the R input. As long as the enable input is at 0, the
cross-coupled SR latch has both inputs at the 1 level and the circuit cannot

change state regardless of the value of D . The D input is sampled when En = 1.
