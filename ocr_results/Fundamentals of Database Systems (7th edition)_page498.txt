specifying JOIN operations at the logical level.> Another problem with NULLs is how
to account for them when aggregate operations such as COUNT or SUM are applied.
SELECT and JOIN operations involve comparisons; if NULL values are present, the
results may become unpredictable.° Moreover, NULLs can have multiple interpreta-

tions, such as the following:

= The attribute does not apply to this tuple. For example, Visa_status may not

apply to U.S. students.

= The attribute value for this tuple is unknown. For example, the Date_of_birth

may be unknown for an employee.

= The value is known but absent; that is, it has not been recorded yet. For
example, the Home_Phone_Number for an employee may exist, but may not

be available and recorded yet.

Having the same representation for all NULLs compromises the different meanings

they may have. Therefore, we state another guideline.

Guideline 3. As far as possible, avoid placing attributes in a base relation whose
values may frequently be NULL. If NULLs are unavoidable, make sure that they apply
in exceptional cases only and do not apply to a majority of tuples in the relation.

Using space efficiently and avoiding joins with NULL values are the two overriding
criteria that determine whether to include the columns that may have NULLs in a
relation or to have a separate relation for those columns (with the appropriate key
columns). For example, if only 15% of employees have individual offices, there is
little justification for including an attribute Office_number in the EMPLOYEE rela-
tion; rather, a relation EMP_OFFICES(Essn, Office_number) can be created to include

tuples for only the employees with individual offices.

14.1.4 Generation of Spurious Tuples

Consider the two relation schemas EMP_LOCS and EMP_PROJ1 in Figure 14.5(a),
which can be used instead of the single EMP_PROJ relation in Figure 14.3(b). A
tuple in EMP_LOCS means that the employee whose name is Ename works on at
least one project located at Plocation. A tuple in EMP_PROJI1 refers to the fact that the
employee whose Social Security number is Ssn works the given Hours per week on
the project whose name, number, and location are Pname, Pnumber, and Plocation.
Figure 14.5(b) shows relation states of EMP_LOCS and EMP_PROJ1 corresponding
to the EMP_PROJ relation in Figure 14.4, which are obtained by applying the appro-

priate PROJECT (1) operations to EMP_PROJ.

SThis is because inner and outer joins produce different results when NULLs are involved in joins. The users
must thus be aware of the different meanings of the various types of joins. Although this is reasonable for

sophisticated users, it may be difficult for others.

8in Section 6.5.1 we presented comparisons involving NULL values where the outcome (in three-valued

logic) is TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN.
