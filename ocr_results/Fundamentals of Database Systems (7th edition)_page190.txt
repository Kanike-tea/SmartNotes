The CAR relation, with
two candidate keys:
License_number and
Engine_serial_number.

CAR

License_number | Engine_serial_number Make Model | Year
Texas ABC-739 69352 Ford Mustang | 02
Florida TVP-347 B43696 Oldsmobile | Cutlass | 05
New York MPO-22 X83554 Oldsmobile | Delta ot
California 432-TFY 43742 Mercedes | 190-D | 99
California RSK-629 Y82935 Toyota Camry | 04
Texas RSK-629 028365 Jaguar XJS 04

the choice of one to become the primary key is somewhat arbitrary; however, it is
usually better to choose a primary key with a single attribute or a small number
of attributes. The other candidate keys are designated as unique keys and are
not underlined.

Another constraint on attributes specifies whether NULL values are or are not per-
mitted. For example, if every STUDENT tuple must have a valid, non-NULL value for
the Name attribute, then Name of STUDENT is constrained to be NOT NULL.

5.2.3 Relational Databases and Relational
Database Schemas

The definitions and constraints we have discussed so far apply to single relations
and their attributes. A relational database usually contains many relations, with
tuples in relations that are related in various ways. In this section, we define a rela-
tional database and a relational database schema.

A relational database schema S is a set of relation schemas $ = {R;, Rp, ... , R,,} and
a set of integrity constraints IC. A relational database state!° DB of S is a set of
relation states DB = {rj, 7, ... , ",} such that each r; is a state of R; and such that the
r, relation states satisfy the integrity constraints specified in IC. Figure 5.5 shows a
relational database schema that we call COMPANY = {EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT,
DEPT_LOCATIONS, PROJECT, WORKS_ON, DEPENDENT}. In each relation schema,
the underlined attribute represents the primary key. Figure 5.6 shows a relational
database state corresponding to the COMPANY schema. We will use this schema
and database state in this chapter and in Chapters 4 through 6 for developing
sample queries in different relational languages. (The data shown here is
expanded and available for loading as a populated database from the Compan-
ion Website for the text, and can be used for the hands-on project exercises at
the end of the chapters.)

When we refer to a relational database, we implicitly include both its schema and its
current state. A database state that does not obey all the integrity constraints is

10, relational database state is sometimes called a relational database snapshot or instance. However,
as we mentioned earlier, we will not use the term instance since it also applies to single tuples.
