Database Management System [BCS403]

1.4 History of Database Applications

= Early Database Applications Using Hierarchical and Network Systems

Early database applications maintained records in large organizations such as corporations,
universities, hospitals, and banks. In many of these applications, there
were large numbers of records of similar structure. There were also many types of records
and many interrelationships among them.
Problems with the early database systems
- lack of data abstraction and program-data independence capabilities
- provided only programming language interfaces. This. made it time-consuming and
expensive to implement new queries and transactions, since new programs had to be
written, tested, and debugged.

= Providing Data Abstraction and Application Flexibility with Relational Databases

Relational databases were originally proposed to separate the physical storage of data from
its conceptual representation and to provide a mathematical foundation for data
representation and querying. The relational data model also introduced high-level query
languages that provided an alternative to programming language interfaces, making it much
faster to write new queries. Hence, data abstraction and program-data independence were

much improved when compared to earlier systems.

= Object-Oriented Applications and the Need for More Complex Databases

Object-oriented databases (OODBs) mainly used in specialized applications, such as
engineering design, multimedia publishing, and manufacturing systems. In addition, many
object-oriented concepts were incorporated into the newer versions of relational DBMSs,
leading to object-relational database management systems, known as ORDBMSs.

= Interchanging Data on the Web for E-Commerce Using XML

The World Wide Web provides a large network of interconnected computers. Users can
create documents using a Web publishing language, such as HyperText Markup Language
(HTML), and store these documents on Web servers where other users (clients) can access
them. Documents can be linked through hyperlinks, which are pointers to other

documents.
