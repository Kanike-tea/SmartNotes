Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

Grid Files. We introduced grid files for indexing of data on multiple attributes in
Chapter 18. They can also be used for indexing two-dimensional and higher
n-dimensional spatial data. The fixed-grid method divides an n-dimensional
hyperspace into equal size buckets. The data structure that implements the fixed
grid is an n-dimensional array. The objects whose spatial locations lie within a cell
(totally or partially) can be stored in a dynamic structure to handle overflows. This
structure is useful for uniformly distributed data like satellite imagery. However,
the fixed-grid structure is rigid, and its directory can be sparse and large.

R-Trees. The R-tree is a height-balanced tree, which is an extension of the B*-tree
for k-dimensions, where k > 1. For two dimensions (2-D), spatial objects are
approximated in the R-tree by their minimum bounding rectangle (MBR), which
is the smallest rectangle, with sides parallel to the coordinate system (x and y) axis,
that contains the object. R-trees are characterized by the following properties,
which are similar to the properties for B*-trees (see Section 18.3) but are adapted to
2-D spatial objects. As in Section 18.3, we use M to indicate the maximum number
of entries that can fit in an R-tree node.

1. The structure of each index entry (or index record) in a leaf node is (I, object-
identifier), where I is the MBR for the spatial object whose identifier is
object-identifier.

2. Every node except the root node must be at least half full. Thus, a leaf
node that is not the root should contain m entries (I, object-identifier) where
M/2 < m< M. Similarly, a non-leaf node that is not the root should contain
m entries (I, child-pointer) where M/2 < m < M, and | is the MBR that con-
tains the union of all the rectangles in the node pointed at by child-pointer.

3. All leaf nodes are at the same level, and the root node should have at least
two pointers unless it is a leaf node.

4. All MBRs have their sides parallel to the axes of the global coordinate system.

Other spatial storage structures include quadtrees and their variations. Quadtrees
generally divide each space or subspace into equally sized areas and proceed with
the subdivisions of each subspace to identify the positions of various objects.
Recently, many newer spatial access structures have been proposed, and this
remains an active research area.

Spatial Join Index. A spatial join index precomputes a spatial join operation
and stores the pointers to the related object in an index structure. Join indexes
improve the performance of recurring join queries over tables that have low
update rates. Spatial join conditions are used to answer queries such as “Create a
list of highway-river combinations that cross.” The spatial join is used to identify
and retrieve these pairs of objects that satisfy the cross spatial relationship.
Because computing the results of spatial relationships is generally time consum-
ing, the result can be computed once and stored in a table that has the pairs of
object identifiers (or tuple ids) that satisfy the spatial relationship, which is essen-
tially the join index.
