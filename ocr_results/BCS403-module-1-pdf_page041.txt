3.4.1 Relationship Types, Sets, and Instances

A relationship type R among n entity types E), E2, ..., En defines a set of associations—or a relationship
set—among entities from these entity types. Entity types and Entity sets, a Relationship type and its
corresponding Relationship set are usually referred to by the same name, R.

Mathematically, the relationship set R is a set of relationship instances ri , where each ri associates n
individual entities (e1, 2, ..., ¢n), and each entity ei in ri is a member of entity set Ej, 1< j<n. Each of the
entity types E;, E2, ..., En is said to participate in the relationship type R. similarly, each of the individual

entities e1, €2,...,@n is said to —_ participate in the relationship instance rj = (e1, 2, ..., €n )

Informally, each relationship instance rj in R is an association of entities, where the association includes
exactly one entity from each participating entity type. For example, consider a relationship type
WORKS FOR between the two entity types EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT, which associates each
employee with the department for which the employee works in the corresponding entity set. Each
relationship instance in the relationship set WORKS FOR» associates one EMPLOYEE entity and one
DEPARTMENT entity.
