The burrs have small hooks that can latch onto clothing, fur, or feathers, allowing them to

disperse their seeds over a wider area.

Velcro was invented by Swiss engineer George De Mestral in 1941, after he becamefascinated
by the way burrs clung to his clothes and his dog's fur during a walk. He examined the burrs
under a microscope and found that they had small hooks thatcould latch onto loops in fabric.
De Mestral spent years experimenting with different materials before finally developing Velcro,
which consists of two strips of nylon fabric, one with tiny hooks and the other with small loops.
When pressed together, the hooks latch onto the loops, creating a strong bond that can be easily
detached by pulling the two strips apart. Velcro has a wide range of applications, including in
clothing, shoes, bags, and medical devices. It has become a popular alternative to traditional

fasteners, such as buttons and zippers, due to its ease of use and versatility.

The name "Velcro" is actually a combination of the words "velvet" and "crochet," as the fabric
strips resemble velvet and are hooked together like crochet. Velcro has since become a popular
alternative to traditional fasteners, such as buttons and zippers, due to its ease of use and

versatility.

Materials Used in Velcro Technology: Velcro technology uses two main materials: nylon and

polyester.

e The nylon is extruded to create tiny hooks that are then cut and shaped into the familiar

hook shape. These hooks are designed to latch onto the loop side of the Velcro.

e The loop side of Velcro is made of polyester. Polyester is a synthetic fabric that is
strong and durable. The polyester is woven into a fabric that has many tiny loops.
When the loops are pressed against the hook side of the Velcro, the hooks latch onto

the loops, creating a secure attachment.

In addition to nylon and polyester, the adhesive used to attach the Velcro to surfaces can also vary.

Some types of Velcro use a pressure-sensitive adhesive that can be easily removed without leaving
