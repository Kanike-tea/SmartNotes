LECTURE-3: 3 level Architecture of DBMS

Database Basics:

Data Item:

The data item is also called as field in data processing and is the smallest unit of data that has
meaning to its users.

Eg: “el01”, ’sumit”

Entities and attributes:
An entity is a thing or object in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects
Eg: Bank, employee, student

Attributes are properties are properties of an entity.
Eg: Empcode, ename, rolno, name

Logical data and physical data :
Logical data are the data for the table created by user in primary memory.
Physical data refers to the data stored in the secondary memory.

Schema and sub-schema
A schema is a logical data base description and is drawn as a chart of the types of data that are used.
It gives the names of the entities and attributes and specify the relationships between them.

Adatabase schema includes such information as :

Characteristics of data items such as entities and attributes .

Logical structures and relationships among these data items .

Format for storage representation.

Integrity parameters such as physical authorization and back up policies.

Vv

A subschema is derived schema derived from existing schema as per the user requirement. There
may be more then one subschema create for a single conceptual schema.
