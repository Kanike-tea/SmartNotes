Each row can contain different sets of columns, and columns can be added dynamically.
This structure allows efficient reads/writes on specific columns without reading the entire
row, making it perfect for sparse data.

Example:
Row Key Personal:Name Personal:Email Orders:Order1 Orders:Order2
user001 Alice alice@example.com TV Laptop

Here, Personal and Orders are column families, and the system allows selective access to
only what’s needed.

3. Popular Column-Based NoSQL Databases
Some of the most prominent wide-column stores include:

« Apache Cassandra: A distributed NoSQL system known for high availability and
horizontal scalability. It is used by companies like Netflix, Instagram, and Uber.

« Apache HBase: Built on top of Hadoop and HDFS, it provides random, real-time
read/write access to big data.

e  ScyllaDB: A high-performance alternative to Cassandra, written in C++ for better
speed and lower latency.

« Google Bigtable: The original inspiration for Cassandra and HBase, used internally
at Google for applications like Search and Maps.

4. Features and Advantages
e Horizontal Scalability: Easily scale out by adding nodes to the cluster.
e High Availability: Designed for fault-tolerance and replication across data centers.

¢ Efficient Reads/Writes: Optimized for large data volumes and quick access to
specific columns.

e Flexible Schema: Schema-less nature allows columns to be added or changed
without downtime.

e Time-Series Friendly: Well-suited for applications that store data over time, such as
logs or metrics.
