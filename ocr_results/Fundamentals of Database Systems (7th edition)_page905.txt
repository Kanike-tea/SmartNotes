23.8 Distributed Catalog Management

the sites at which the data referenced in the query or transaction resides. This
property is called distribution transparency. Some DDBMSs do not provide distri-
bution transparency, instead requiring that applications are aware of the details of
data distribution.

23.8 Distributed Catalog Management

Efficient catalog management in distributed databases is critical to ensure satisfac-
tory performance related to site autonomy, view management, and data distribu-
tion and replication. Catalogs are databases themselves containing metadata about
the distributed database system.

Three popular management schemes for distributed catalogs are centralized cata-
logs, fully replicated catalogs, and partitioned catalogs. The choice of the scheme
depends on the database itself as well as the access patterns of the applications to
the underlying data.

Centralized Catalogs. In this scheme, the entire catalog is stored in one single
site. Due to its central nature, it is easy to implement. On the other hand, the
advantages of reliability, availability, autonomy, and distribution of processing
load are adversely impacted. For read operations from noncentral sites, the
requested catalog data is locked at the central site and is then sent to the
requesting site. On completion of the read operation, an acknowledgment is
sent to the central site, which in turn unlocks this data. All update operations
must be processed through the central site. This can quickly become a perfor-
mance bottleneck for write-intensive applications.

Fully Replicated Catalogs. In this scheme, identical copies of the complete
catalog are present at each site. This scheme facilitates faster reads by allowing
them to be answered locally. However, all updates must be broadcast to all
sites. Updates are treated as transactions, and a centralized two-phase commit
scheme is employed to ensure catalog consistency. As with the centralized
scheme, write-intensive applications may cause increased network traffic due
to the broadcast associated with the writes.

Partially Replicated Catalogs. The centralized and fully replicated schemes
restrict site autonomy since they must ensure a consistent global view of the
catalog. Under the partially replicated scheme, each site maintains complete
catalog information on data stored locally at that site. Each site is also permit-
ted to cache entries retrieved from remote sites. However, there are no guaran-
tees that these cached copies will be the most recent and updated. The system
tracks catalog entries for sites where the object was created and for sites that
contain copies of this object. Any changes to copies are propagated immedi-
ately to the original (birth) site. Retrieving updated copies to replace stale data
may be delayed until an access to this data occurs. In general, fragments of rela-
tions across sites should be uniquely accessible. Also, to ensure data distribu-
tion transparency, users should be allowed to create synonyms for remote
objects and use these synonyms for subsequent referrals.
