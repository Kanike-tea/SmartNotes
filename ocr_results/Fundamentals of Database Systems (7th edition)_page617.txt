16.10 Parallelizing Disk Access Using RAID Technology

RAID level 0 uses data striping, has no redundant data, and hence has the best write
performance since updates do not have to be duplicated. It splits data evenly across
two or more disks. However, its read performance is not as good as RAID level 1,
which uses mirrored disks. In the latter, performance improvement is possible by
scheduling a read request to the disk with shortest expected seek and rotational
delay. RAID level 2 uses memory-style redundancy by using Hamming codes,
which contain parity bits for distinct overlapping subsets of components. Thus, in
one particular version of this level, three redundant disks suffice for four original
disks, whereas with mirroring—as in level 1—four would be required. Level 2
includes both error detection and correction, although detection is generally not
required because broken disks identify themselves.

RAID level 3 uses a single parity disk relying on the disk controller to figure out
which disk has failed. Levels 4 and 5 use block-level data striping, with level 5 dis-
tributing data and parity information across all disks. Figure 16.14(b) shows an
illustration of RAID level 5, where parity is shown with subscript p. If one disk fails,
the missing data is calculated based on the parity available from the remaining
disks. Finally, RAID level 6 applies the so-called P + Q redundancy scheme using
Reed-Soloman codes to protect against up to two disk failures by using just two
redundant disks.

Rebuilding in case of disk failure is easiest for RAID level 1. Other levels require
the reconstruction of a failed disk by reading multiple disks. Level 1 is used for
critical applications such as storing logs of transactions. Levels 3 and 5 are pre-
ferred for large volume storage, with level 3 providing higher transfer rates. Most
popular use of RAID technology currently uses level 0 (with striping), level 1 (with
mirroring), and level 5 with an extra drive for parity. A combination of multiple
RAID levels are also used—for example, 0 + 1 combines striping and mirroring
