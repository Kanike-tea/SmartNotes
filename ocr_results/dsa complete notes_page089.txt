Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module III

Almost Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree of depth d is an almost complete binary tree if

a. Anode nat level less than d-1 has two sons
b. For any node n in the tree with a right descendant at level d, n must have a left son and every

left descendant of n is either a leaf at level d or has two sons

Example

Binary Tree representations
Array Representation: If a complete binary tree with n nodes is represented sequentially,
then for any node with index i, 1 <i<n, we have

> parent (i) is at [i/ 2] ifi# 1. Ifi=1, iis at the root and has no parent.
> leftChild (i) is at 2i if 2i<n. If 2i>n, then i has no left child.
> rightChild (i) is at 21+ 1 if 2i+ 1 <n. If 2i+ 1 >n, then i has no right child.
