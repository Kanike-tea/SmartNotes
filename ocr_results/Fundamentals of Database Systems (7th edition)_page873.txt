23.1 Distributed Database Concepts

Networks may have different topologies that define the direct communication
paths among sites. The type and topology of the network used may have a signifi-
cant impact on the performance and hence on the strategies for distributed query
processing and distributed database design. For high-level architectural issues,
however, it does not matter what type of network is used; what matters is that each
site be able to communicate, directly or indirectly, with every other site. For the
remainder of this chapter, we assume that some type of network exists among
nodes, regardless of any particular topology. We will not address any network-
specific issues, although it is important to understand that for an efficient operation
of a distributed database system (DDBS), network design and performance issues
are critical and are an integral part of the overall solution. The details of the under-
lying network are invisible to the end user.

23.1.2 Transparency

The concept of transparency extends the general idea of hiding implementation
details from end users. A highly transparent system offers a lot of flexibility to the
end user/application developer since it requires little or no awareness of underly-
ing details on their part. In the case of a traditional centralized database, transpar-
ency simply pertains to logical and physical data independence for application
developers. However, in a DDB scenario, the data and software are distributed
over multiple nodes connected by a computer network, so additional types of
transparencies are introduced.

Consider the company database in Figure 5.5 that we have been discussing through-
out the book. The EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, and WORKS_ON tables may be fragmented
horizontally (that is, into sets of rows, as we will discuss in Section 23.2) and stored
with possible replication, as shown in Figure 23.1. The following types of transpar-
encies are possible:

= Data organization transparency (also known as distribution or network
transparency). This refers to freedom for the user from the operational
details of the network and the placement of the data in the distributed sys-
tem. It may be divided into location transparency and naming transparency.
Location transparency refers to the fact that the command used to perform
a task is independent of the location of the data and the location of the node
where the command was issued. Naming transparency implies that once a
name is associated with an object, the named objects can be accessed unam-
biguously without additional specification as to where the data is located.

= Replication transparency. As we show in Figure 23.1, copies of the same
data objects may be stored at multiple sites for better availability, perfor-
mance, and reliability. Replication transparency makes the user unaware of
the existence of these copies.

= Fragmentation transparency. Two types of fragmentation are possible.
Horizontal fragmentation distributes a relation (table) into subrelations
that are subsets of the tuples (rows) in the original relation; this is also known
