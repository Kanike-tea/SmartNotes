The calculated value of Z is more than Zo.05" Zoo} inone tailed test as well as Zo qs in
two tailed test. i. ~

Thus we conclude that the difference in the mean grade is significant in these
tests but the same is not significant in the two tailed test at 1% level of
significance.

Test of significance of difference between means

24. In an elementary school examination the mean grade of 32 boys was 72 with a standard

deviation of 8, zohile the mean grade of 36 girls was 75 with a standard deviation of 6. Test
the hypothesis that the performance of girls is better than boys.

>> We have cm = 72, OB= 8, ng = 32 [Boys]
Xq = 75, 9g = 6, ng = 36 [Girls]

The difference in the performance of girls and boys in the examination is significant
at 5% level but not at 1% level. , ;

25. A sample of 100 bulbs produced by a company A showed a mean life of 1190 hours and a”

standard deviation of 90 hours. Also a sample of 75 bulbs produced by a company B showed
a mean life of 1230 hours and a standard deviation of 120 hours. Is there a difference
between the mean life time of the bulbs produced by the two companies at

(a) 5% level'of significance (b) 1% level of significance. .

>> By data x, = 1190, 6, = 90, 4 = 100 [Company A]
Xp = 1230, 6g = 120, mg = 75 [Company B]
