ale Max-flow and Min-cut Theorem 241

Find the maximum flow possible between the vertices P and:S in the network

shown in Figure 4.48.

Figure 4.48

» By examining the given network, we find that the cut-sets with respect to the vertex-pair
(P,S), namely the P- S.cuts, are

{PQ}, (QT,OS,OR}, (OR, OS,TS), (QT, QS,RS}, {TS,OS,RS).

The capacities of these cut-sets are, respectively, 18, 17, 15, 16,,14, Evidently, the last
cut-set has the minimum capacity, 14. The possible maximum flow i is therefore 14 units. .
Example 3 gaa ‘the network shown below, determine the maximum flow between the vertices
Aand D by identifying the cut-set of minimum capacity.

» By examining the given network, we find that the A-D cuts (that is cut-sets with respect to

the Vertex- pair (A, D)) are:
(AB, AF). (AB, BF, FE}, (AB,BF,CE,ED}, (AF, FB, BC},
(AF, FB, CE,CD}, {BC, FE), {BC,CE,ED}, (FE, EC,CD), {CD, ED}.

num flow is therefore 6 units.
