Output Unit
co The output unit is the counterpart of the input unit.
o. Its function is to send processed results to the outside world.
o A familiar example of such a device is a printer.

o Most printers employ either photocopying techniques, as in laser printers,

or ink jetstreams.
o Such printers may generate output at speeds of 20 or more pages per minute.

o However, printers are mechanical devices, and as such are quite slow

compared tothe electronic speed of a processor.

o Some units, such as graphic displays, provide both an output function, showing text

o and graphics, and an input function, through touchscreen capability.

Control Unit

The memory, arithmetic and logic, and I/O units store and process information and

perform input and output operations.
The operation of these units must be coordinated in some way.
This is the responsibility of the control unit.

The control unit is effectively the nerve center that sends control signals to

other units and senses their states.

J/O transfers, consisting of input and output operations, are controlled by
program instructions that identify the devices involved and the information to

be transferred.

Control circuits are responsible for generating the timing signals that govern the

transfers and determine when a given action is to take place.

Data transfers between the processor and the memory are also managed by the

control unit through timing signals.

A large set of control lines (wires) carries the signals used

for timing and synchronization of events in all units.
