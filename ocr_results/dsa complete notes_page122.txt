Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module V

Example: K=3205 K?= 10272025 H(K)= 72
Folding: Partition the keys k into several parts

= All parts except for the last one have the same length
= The parts are added together to obtain the hash address
= Two possibilities

Example k= 12320324111220
x1=123, x2=203, x3=241, x4=112, x5=20, address= 123+203+241+112+20= 699

Digit Analysis

Useful in the case of a static file where all the keys in the table are known in advance

Each key is interpreted using some radix r.

The same radix is used for all the keys in the table

Digits are examined with this radix

Digits having the most skewed distributions are deleted.

Enough digits are deleted so that the remaining digits are small enough to give and address in
the range of hash table

Converting keys to integers
Two methods used for converting keys to integer are

* Converting each character toa unique integer and summing these unique integers.

' Shifting the integer corresponding to every other character by 8 bits and then summing it up
Over Flow Handling

Synonyms: Hash function h maps several different keys into the same bucket
Two keys, k1 and k2 are synonyms with respect to h
if h(k1) = h(k2)

An overflow occurs when home bucket for a new dictionary pair is full when we wish to insert
this pair

A collision occurs when the home bucket for the new pair is not empty at the time of insertion.

Two popular ways To handle overflows
= Open Addressing/ Linear Probing
= Chaining

Open Addressing/Linear Probing
= When inserting a new pair whose key is k we search the hash table in the order
ht[h(k) +i]%b, 0<=i <=b-1, where
= his the hash function and
= bis the number of buckets
"The search terminates when we reach the first unfilled bucket and the new pair is inserted into
this bucket.
1 __Incase_no_such bucket is found, the table is full and the size of the hash table needs to_be
