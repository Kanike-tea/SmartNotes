4.6 Shark Skin and Friction Reducing Swim Suits

The denticles on shark skin have evolved over millions of years to reduce drag and increase
swimming efficiency. These structures disrupt the flow of water around the shark's body,
reducing turbulence and minimizing the formation of vortices. As a result, sharks can swim
faster and with less effort compared to other fish.
