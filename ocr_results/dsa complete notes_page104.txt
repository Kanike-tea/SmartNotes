Case 2: If N has exactly one child. Then N is deleted from T by replacing the location of N in Parent
(N) by the location of the only child of N.

Example: Deleting Node 75 with exactly one children

Case 3: N has Two children. Let S(N) denote the inorder successor of N(S(N) does not have a left
child).Then N is deleted from T by first deleting S(N) from T (by using casel or cae 2) and then
replacing node N in T by the node S(N).

Example: Deleting Node 25 with two children
