These yield the following correspondence between the vertices:

MOV, U2 V4, U3 vs,
U4 V2, Us V3, U6 V6.

We observe that the above correspondences between the edges and the vertices are one-to-
one correspondences and that these preserve the adjacency of vertices. In view of the existence
of these correspondences, we infer that the two graphs are isomorphic.

We note that the first graph is the complete bipartite graph K3,3; see Figure 1.21(d). The
second graph is just another drawing of K33. .

eae Show that the following two graphs are isomorphic.

> We first note that each of the two graphs is 3-regular (cubic) and has 10 vertices. Consider

the one-to-one correspondence between the vertices as shown below:

This correspondence has been arrived at after closely examining the structures of the two

graphs,

We check that the above mentioned correspondence yields one-to-one correspondence be-
‘Ween the edges in the two graphs with the property that adjacent vertices in the first graph
“oTtespond to the adjacent vertices in the second graph and vice-versa. The two graphs are

erefore isomorphic.

We note that the first graph is the Petersen graph, see Figure 1.37.

The second graph is just
