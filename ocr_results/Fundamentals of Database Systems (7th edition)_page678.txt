Explain what alternative choices exist for accessing a file based on multiple
search keys.

What is partitioned hashing? How does it work? What are its limitations?
What is a grid file? What are its advantages and disadvantages?

Show an example of constructing a grid array on two attributes on some file.
What is a fully inverted file? What is an indexed sequential file?

How can hashing be used to construct an index?

What is bitmap indexing? Create a relation with two columns and sixteen
tuples and show an example of a bitmap index on one or both.

What is the concept of function-based indexing? What additional purpose
does it serve?

. What is the difference between a logical index and a physical index?

What is column-based storage of a relational database?

Exercises

Consider a disk with block size B = 512 bytes. A block pointer is P = 6 bytes
long, and a record pointer is Pg = 7 bytes long. A file has r = 30,000
EMPLOYEE records of fixed length. Each record has the following fields:
Name (30 bytes),Ssn (9 bytes), Department_code (9 bytes), Address (40 bytes),
Phone (10 bytes), Birth_date (8 bytes), Sex (1 byte), Job_code (4 bytes), and
Salary (4 bytes, real number). An additional byte is used as a deletion marker.
a. Calculate the record size R in bytes.

b. Calculate the blocking factor bfr and the number of file blocks b, assuming
an unspanned organization.

c. Suppose that the file is ordered by the key field Ssn and we want to con-
struct a primary index on Ssn. Calculate (i) the index blocking factor bfr;
(which is also the index fan-out fo); (ii) the number of first-level index
entries and the number of first-level index blocks; (iii) the number of lev-
els needed if we make it into a multilevel index; (iv) the total number of
blocks required by the multilevel index; and (v) the number of block
accesses needed to search for and retrieve a record from the file—given
its Ssn value—using the primary index.

d. Suppose that the file is not ordered by the key field Ssn and we want to
construct a secondary index on Ssn. Repeat the previous exercise (part c)
for the secondary index and compare with the primary index.

e. Suppose that the file is not ordered by the nonkey field Department_code
and we want to construct a secondary index on Department_code, using
