Table 15.7 Saturation instructions.

Instruction Description

SSAT Rd, #<BitPosition>, Rm, {<Shift>} Signed 32-bit saturation at an arbitrary bit
position. Shift can be an LSL or ASR.

SSAT16{<cond>} Rd, #<immed>, Rm Dual 16-bit saturation at the same position in
both halves.

USAT Rd, #<BitPosition>, Rm, {<Shift>} Unsigned 32-bit saturation at an arbitrary bit
position. Shift can be LSL or ASR.

USAT16{<cond>} Rd, #<immed>, Rm Unsigned dual 16-bit saturation at the same
position in both halves.

Note that in the 32-bit versions of these saturation operations there is an optional
arithmetic shift of the source register Rm before saturation, allowing scaling to take place
in the same instruction.

15.1.5 SUM OF ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCES INSTRUCTIONS

These two new instructions are probably the most application specific within the ARMv6
architecture—USAD8 and USADA8. They are used to compute the absolute difference
between eight-bit values and are particularly useful in motion video compression algorithms
such as MPEG or H.263, including motion estimation algorithms that measure motion by
comparing blocks using many sum-of-absolute-difference operations (see Figure 15.2).
Table 15.8 lists these instructions.

Table 15.8 Sum of absolute differences.

Instruction Description
USAD8{<cond>} Rd, Rm, Rs Sum of absolute differences
USADA8{<cond>} Rd, Rm, Rs, Rn Accumulated sum of absolute differences

To compare an N x N square at (x, y) in image p; with an N x N square po, we calculate
the accumulated sum of absolute differences:
