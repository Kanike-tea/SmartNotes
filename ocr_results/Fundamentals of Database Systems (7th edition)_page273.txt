8.1 Unary Relational Operations: SELECT and PROJECT

In general, the result of a SELECT operation can be determined as follows. The
<selection condition> is applied independently to each individual tuple t in R. This
is done by substituting each occurrence of an attribute A; in the selection condition
with its value in the tuple ¢[Aj]. If the condition evaluates to TRUE, then tuple t is
selected. All the selected tuples appear in the result of the SELECT operation. The
Boolean conditions AND, OR, and NOT have their normal interpretation, as follows:

= (cond1 AND cond2) is TRUE if both (cond1) and (cond2) are TRUE; other-
wise, it is FALSE.

= (cond1 OR cond2) is TRUE if either (cond1) or (cond2) or both are TRUE;
otherwise, it is FALSE.

= (NOT cond) is TRUE if cond is FALSE; otherwise, it is FALSE.

The SELECT operator is unary; that is, it is applied to a single relation. Moreover,
the selection operation is applied to each tuple individually; hence, selection condi-
tions cannot involve more than one tuple. The degree of the relation resulting from
a SELECT operation—its number of attributes—is the same as the degree of R. The
number of tuples in the resulting relation is always less than or equal to the number
of tuples in R. That is, |oc (R)| < |R| for any condition C. The fraction of tuples
selected by a selection condition is referred to as the selectivity of the condition.

Notice that the SELECT operation is commutative; that is,

G<condi>(G<conda>(R)) = G.<conda>(G<condi>(R))

Hence, a sequence of SELECTs can be applied in any order. In addition, we can
always combine a cascade (or sequence) of SELECT operations into a single SELECT
operation with a conjunctive (AND) condition; that is,

G <condi >(O <conda>(- (Gcondn>(R)) --)) = O<cond1> AND<cond2> AND..AND <condn>(R)

In SQL, the SELECT condition is typically specified in the WHERE clause of a query.
For example, the following operation:

Opno=4 AND Salary>25000 (EMPLOYEE)
would correspond to the following SQL query:

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dno=4 AND Salary>25000;

8.1.2 The PROJECT Operation

If we think of a relation as a table, the SELECT operation chooses some of the rows
from the table while discarding other rows. The PROJECT operation, on the other
hand, selects certain columns from the table and discards the other columns. If we
are interested in only certain attributes of a relation, we use the PROJECT operation
to project the relation over these attributes only. Therefore, the result of the PROJECT
operation can be visualized as a vertical partition of the relation into two relations:
