Figure 21.9 shows a possible serializable schedule for these three transactions.
Only the lock and unlock operations are shown. The notation <lock_type>(<item>)

is used to display the locking operations in the schedule.

The multiple granularity level protocol is especially suited when processing a
mix of transactions that include (1) short transactions that access only a few
items (records or fields) and (2) long transactions that access entire files. In
this environment, less transaction blocking and less locking overhead are
incurred by such a protocol when compared to a single-level granularity lock-

ing approach.
