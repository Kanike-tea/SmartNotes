Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

only a brief introduction to each. In fact, each of these areas can serve as the sole
topic of a complete book.

In Section 26.1, we introduce the topic of active databases, which provide addi-
tional functionality for specifying active rules. These rules can be automatically
triggered by events that occur, such as database updates or certain times being
reached, and can initiate certain actions that have been specified in the rule declara-
tion to occur if certain conditions are met. Many commercial packages include
some of the functionality provided by active databases in the form of triggers.
Triggers are now part of the SQL-99 and later standards.

In Section 26.2, we introduce the concepts of temporal databases, which permit
the database system to store a history of changes and allow users to query both cur-
rent and past states of the database. Some temporal database models also allow
users to store future expected information, such as planned schedules. It is impor-
tant to note that many database applications are temporal, but they are often imple-
mented without having much temporal support from the DBMS package—that is,
the temporal concepts are implemented in the application programs that access the
database. The ability to create and query temporal data has been added to the SQL
standard in SQL:2011 and is available in the DB2 system, but we do not discuss it
here. The interested reader is referred to the end-of-chapter bibliography.

Section 26.3 gives a brief overview of spatial database concepts. We discuss types of
spatial data, different kinds of spatial analyses, operations on spatial data, types of
spatial queries, spatial data indexing, spatial data mining, and applications of spatial
databases. Most commercial and open source relational systems provide spatial
support in their data types and query languages as well as providing indexing and
efficient query processing for common spatial operations.

Section 26.4 is devoted to multimedia database concepts. Multimedia databases
provide features that allow users to store and query different types of multimedia
information, which includes images (such as pictures and drawings), video clips
(such as movies, newsreels, and home videos), audio clips (such as songs, phone
messages, and speeches), and documents (such as books and articles). We discuss
automatic analysis of images, object recognition in images, and semantic tagging
of images.

In Section 26.5, we discuss deductive databases,’ an area that is at the intersection of
databases, logic, and artificial intelligence or knowledge bases. A deductive
database system includes capabilities to define (deductive) rules, which can deduce
or infer additional information from the facts that are stored in a database. Because
part of the theoretical foundation for some deductive database systems is mathe-
matical logic, such rules are often referred to as logic databases. Other types of
systems, referred to as expert database systems or knowledge-based systems, also
incorporate reasoning and inferencing capabilities; such systems use techniques

'Section 265 is a summary of Deductive Databases. The full chapter from the third edition, which provides
a more comprehensive introduction, is available on the book's Web site.
