Fig 1: Memory hierarchy

The innermost level of the hierarchy is at the processor core. This memory is so tightly coupled
to the processor that in many ways it is difficult to think of it as separate from the processor. This
memory is known as a register file. These registers are integral to the processor core and provide

the fastest possible memory access in the system.

At the primary level, memory components are connected to the processor core through dedicated
on-chip interfaces. It is at this level we find tightly coupled memory (TCM) and level | cache.

We talk more about caches in a moment.

Also at the primary level is main memory. It includes volatile components like SRAM and
DRAM, and nonvolatile components like flash memory. The purpose of main memory is to hold

programs while they are running on a system.
