COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

Consider the second statement to add data between two registers

. “Add the contents of Ro with the contents of Ri and result is stored in Ro”
. The assembly language notation of this statement is given by
ADD Ro, Ri, R2

Opcode sourcel, Source2, Destination

This instruction adds the contents of Ro with the contents of R: and result is stored in Ro
. The mathematical representation of this statement is givemby

R2 —[Ro] + [Ri].

Such a notations are called as “Assembly Language Notations”

BASIC INSTRUCTION TYPES
There are 3 types basic instructions namely,
il, Three address instruction format
Do Two address instruction format
Bo One address instruction format

Consider the arithmetic expression Z = A + B, Where A,B,Z are the Memory locations.
Steps for evaluation

Access the first memory operand whose symbolic name is given by A.

Access thessecond memory operand whose symbolic name is given by B.

Perform the addition operation between two memory operands.

Storethé result into the 3" memory location Z.

The mathematical representation is Z [A] + [B].

APYwYN ES

a) Three address instruction format : Its format is as follows
opcode Source-1 Source-2 destination

Destination <— [source-1] + [source-2]
Ex: ADD A,B, Z

Z —[A] +[B]
a) Two address instruction format : Its format is as follows
opcode Source Source/destination

Destination — [source] + [destination]
The sequence of two address m/c instructions to evaluate the arithmetic expression
Z<— A+Bareas follows

MOV A, Ro
MOV B, Ri
ADD Ro, Ri
MOV RZ
