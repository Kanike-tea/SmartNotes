DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

TREES

In linear data structure, data is organized in sequential order and in non-linear data
structure, data is organized in random order. Tree is a very popular data structure used
in wide range of applications. A tree data structure can be defined as follows...

Tree is a non-linear data structure which organizes data in hierarchical fashion and the
tree structure follows a recursive pattern of organizing and storing data.

Every individual element is called as Node. Node in a tree data structure, stores the
actual data of that particular element and link to next element in hierarchical structure.

if there are N number of nodes in a tree structure, then there can be a maximum of N-

1 number of links.

Example
TREE with 11 nodes and 10 edges
(8) (©) - In any Aree with ‘N nodes there

will be maximum of ‘N-1’ edges

(0) (E) (F) (G) © - Ina tre@ everpindividual
element is called as ‘NODE’

DEFINITION

A tree is a finite set of one or, more nodes such that
¢. There is a specially designated node called root.
e The remaining nodes are partitioned into n >= 0 disjoint set T1,...,7n, where
each of these sets is a tree. T1,...,7n are called the subtrees of the root.

Figure (A)
Every node in the tree is the root of some subtree.
