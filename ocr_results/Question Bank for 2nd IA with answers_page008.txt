5. Electrical Coordination:
o The sinoatrial (SA) node acts as the natural pacemaker, sending electrical impulses that coordinate
heartbeats and ensure rhythmic pumping.
6. Adaptability:
o The heart can adjust the rate and strength of contractions based on the body’s needs (e.g., during

exercise or rest).

9. What is ECG? Discuss the type of heart activities detected using ECG.
Ans. The heart's pumping action is controlled by electrical signaling, which generates the rhythm of the
heartbeat. This electrical signaling can be monitored using an electrocardiogram (ECG), which records the
electrical activity of the heart and provides important information about the heart's function.
An ECG measures the electrical signals produced by the heart as it beats and generates a trace or waveform
that reflects the electrical activity of the heart. This trace can be used to diagnose heart conditions and
monitor the heart's function.
Some common heart-related issues that can be diagnosed or monitored using an ECG include:
+ Arrhythmias: Abnormalities in the heart's rhythm or rate can be detected using an ECG.
+ Heart disease: Changes in the heart's electrical activity can indicate the presence of heart disease, such as
coronary artery disease or heart attacks.
+ Heart attack: An ECG can help diagnose a heart attack by detecting changes in the heart's electrical
activity that indicate a lack of blood flow to the heart.
