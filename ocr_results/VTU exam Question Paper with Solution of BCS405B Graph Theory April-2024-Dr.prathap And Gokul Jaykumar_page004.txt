Its edge set is a subset of the edge set of the larger graph.

Essentially, a subgraph is a graph within a larger graph1. All the vertices
and edges of the subgraph are also present in the larger graph

(iii) A pendant vertex in a graph G is a vertex of degree 1.

b)

(i) Let yy = (01,02, V4,...-a} and V, SV, V2 V where

V; = (v4, vy, v5,....¥,} be odd degree vertices set.

Ve = {Vp44, Vy 42)-+.- Un} be even degree vertices

© Yideg(v,) = 2m — 2m, = 2(m—m,) = 2N (say) = Even qty.

This implies that the sum of degrees of all the odd degree vertices is even,

Hence the number of odd degree vertices is even.

c) Graphs can be used to model many types of relations and processes in physical,
biological, social and information systems, and it has a wide range of useful
applications, such as:

1. Finding communities in networks, such as social media
(friend/connection recommendations), or for possible spread of COVID-19
in the community through contacts.

Ranking hyperlinks in search engines.
GPS in Google maps to find the shortest path home.
4. Study of molecules and atoms in chemistry.
