1.2 Nucleic Acids:
Nucleic acids are biopolymers that play a crucial role in the storage and transfer of
genetic information in all living organisms. There are two types of nucleic acids:

¢ Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): DNA is the genetic material that carries the
instructions for the development, functioning, and reproduction of all living
organisms. DNA is a double stranded helix structure composed of nucleotides, which
consist of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine,
guanine, cytosine, or thymine).

e Ribonucleic acid (RNA): RNA is involved in the expression of the genetic
information stored in DNA by carrying the message from the DNA to the ribosome,
where it is used to build proteins. RNA is a single-stranded molecule composed of
nucleotides, which consist of a sugar (ribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous

base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil).

Both DNA and RNA play essential roles in the functioning of cells and organisms, and
their structures and interactions with other molecules are the basis for many biological

processes such as replication, transcription, and translation.
