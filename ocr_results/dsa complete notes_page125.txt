Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module V

e Each list containing the synonyms for that bucket.
e Search involves
o Computing the hash address h(k), and
o Examining the keys in the list of h(k)
Example: Insert acos, atoi,char,define,exp,ceil cos, float, atol, floor , ctime into a 26 bucket hash
table maintained as hash chain

0] | ——~ | acos-> atoi-> atol

1] | ——»| NULL

2) | — | char -. Ceil-> cos -> ctime
3] | ——> | define

4) |——> [exp

5] | —— | float-.floor

6] | ——» | NULL

25] | ——» | NULL

5.74 Rehashing: When the hash table becomes nearly full, the number of collisions increases, thereby
degrading the performance of insertion and search operations. In such cases, a better option is to create
a new hash table with size double of the original hash table.

All the entries in the original hash table will then have to be moved to the new hash table. This is done
by taking each entry, computing its new hash value, and then inserting it in the new hash table. Though
rehashing seems to be a simple process, it is quite expensive and must therefore not be done frequently.

Example:
Consider the hash table of size 5 given below. The hash function used is h(x)= x % 5.

0 1 2 3 4
| 26 | 31 | 43 | 17 |

Rehash the entries into to anew hash table using hash function—h(x)= x % 10.

o 4 #2 3 #4 #5 6 7 8 9
31 43 26 | 17 |

Dynamic hashing

Limitation of static hashing: when the table tends to be full, overflow increases and reduces
performance.

To ensure good performance, it is necessary to increase the size of a hash table whenever the
loading density exceeds a prescribed threshold.
