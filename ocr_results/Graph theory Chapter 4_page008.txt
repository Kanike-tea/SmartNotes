Step 3. Start from the vertex v,, and repeat the process of Step 2. Stop the process when all the
n vertices have been connected by n— 1 edges. These n —1 edges constitute anak |
spanning tree.

" Remarks : |
(1) In the process of connecting an edge to its nearest neighbour as explained above, care
has to be taken that cycles are not created by the connections.

(2) Like in the Kruskal’s method, a minimal spanning tree determined by the Prim’s method
is not unique.

Ss Using Prim’s algorithm, find a minimal spanning tree for the weighted graph
shown below.

Figure 4.13

> We observe that the graph has 5 vertices. Therefore, a minimal spanning tree thereof wil
have 4 edges,

Let us tabulate the Weights of the edges between every pair of vertices as shown below:
