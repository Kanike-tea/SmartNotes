34 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

access path is a search structure that makes the search for particular database
records efficient, such as indexing or hashing. We discuss physical storage tech-
niques and access structures in Chapters 16 and 17. An index is an example of an
access path that allows direct access to data using an index term or a keyword. It is
similar to the index at the end of this text, except that it may be organized in a lin-
ear, hierarchical (tree-structured), or some other fashion.

Another class of data models is known as self-describing data models. The data
storage in systems based on these models combines the description of the data with
the data values themselves. In traditional DBMSs, the description (schema) is sepa-
rated from the data. These models include XML (see Chapter 12) as well as many of
the key-value stores and NOSQL systems (see Chapter 24) that were recently cre-
ated for managing big data.

2.1.2 Schemas, Instances, and Database State

In a data model, it is important to distinguish between the description of the
database and the database itself. The description of a database is called the
database schema, which is specified during database design and is not expected
to change frequently.° Most data models have certain conventions for displaying
schemas as diagrams.’ A displayed schema is called a schema diagram. Figure 2.1
shows a schema diagram for the database shown in Figure 1.2; the diagram dis-
plays the structure of each record type but not the actual instances of records.

®Schema changes are usually needed as the requirements of the database applications change. Most
database systems include operations for allowing schema changes.

“It is customary in database parlance to use schemas as the plural for schema, even though schemata is
the proper plural form. The word scheme is also sometimes used to refer to a schema.
