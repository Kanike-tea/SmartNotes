352 Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP

“Computer Architecture’. A few comments about this example and about PHP
functions in general:

= The built-in PHP array function array_key_exists($k, $a) returns true
if the value in variable $k exists as a key in the associative array in the vari-
able $a. In our example, it checks whether the $course value provided
exists as a key in the array $teaching_assignments (line 1 in Figure 11.5).

= Function arguments are passed by value. Hence, in this example, the calls in
lines 11 and 13 could not change the array $teaching provided as argu-
ment for the call. The values provided in the arguments are passed (copied)
to the function arguments when the function is called.

= Return values of a function are placed after the RETURN keyword. A function
can return any type. In this example, it returns a string type. Two different
strings can be returned in our example, depending on whether the $course
key value provided exists in the array or not.

= Scope rules for variable names apply as in other programming languages.
Global variables outside of the function cannot be used unless they are referred
to using the built-in PHP array $GLoBaLs. Basically, $¢LOBALS[ 'abc' ] will
access the value in a global variable $abc defined outside the function. Other-
wise, variables appearing inside a function are local even if there is a global
variable with the same name.

The previous discussion gives a brief overview of PHP functions. Many details are
not discussed since it is not our goal to present PHP in detail.

11.2.4 PHP Server Variables and Forms

There are a number of built-in entries in a PHP auto-global built-in array variable
called $_SERVER that can provide the programmer with useful information about
the server where the PHP interpreter is running, as well as other information. These
may be needed when constructing the text in an HTML document (for example, see
line 7 in Figure 11.4). Here are some of these entries:

1. $_SERVER[ 'SERVER_NAME' ]. This provides the Web site name or the Uni-
form Resource Locator (URL) of the server computer where the PHP inter-
preter is running. For example, if the PHP interpreter is running on the
Web site http://www.uta.edu, then this string would be the value in
$_SERVER[ 'SERVER_NAME' ].

2. $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDRESS' }. This is the IP (Internet Protocol) address
of the client user computer that is accessing the server; for example,
129.107.61.8.

3. $_SERVER['REMOTE_HoST' ]. This is the Web site name (URL) of the client
user computer; for example, abc.uta.edu. In this case, the server will need to
translate the name into an IP address to access the client.

4. $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']. This is the part of the URL address that comes
after a backslash (/) at the end of the URL.
