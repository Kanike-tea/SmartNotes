LECTURE-14: Clustering Index

Clustering Indexes:
If the records of a file are physically ordered on a non key field that does not have a distinct value

for each record, that filed is called the clustering filed of the file. We can create a different type of
index called clustering index to speed up retrieval of records that have the same value for the
clustering field. This differs from a primary index, which requires that the ordering field of the data
file have a distinct value for each record.

A clustering index is also an ordered file with two fields, the first field is of the same type as
the clustering field of the data file and the second field is block pointer. There is one entry in the
clustering index for each distinct value of the clustering field, containing that value and a pointer to
the first block in the data file that has a record with that value for its clustering field.

Acclustering index is another example of non dense index.

Secondary Indexes:

A secondary index also is an ordered file with two fields and as in the other indexes, the second
filed is a pointer to a disk block. The first field is of the same type as some non ordering field of the
data file. The field on which the secondary index is constructed is called an indexing field of the
file. Whether its values are distinct for every record or not.
