464 Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

The semantics of the other two relation schemas in Figure 14.1 are slightly more
complex. Each tuple in DEPT_LOCATIONS gives a department number (Dnumber)
and one of the locations of the department (Dlocation). Each tuple in WORKS_ON
gives an employee Social Security number (Ssn), the project number of one of the
projects that the employee works on (Pnumber), and the number of hours per week
that the employee works on that project (Hours). However, both schemas have a
well-defined and unambiguous interpretation. The schema DEPT_LOCATIONS rep-
resents a multivalued attribute of DEPARTMENT, whereas WORKS_ON represents
an M:N relationship between EMPLOYEE and PROJECT. Hence, all the relation
schemas in Figure 14.1 may be considered as easy to explain and therefore good
from the standpoint of having clear semantics. We can thus formulate the following
informal design guideline.

Guideline 1. Design a relation schema so that it is easy to explain its meaning. Do
not combine attributes from multiple entity types and relationship types into a sin-
gle relation. Intuitively, if a relation schema corresponds to one entity type or one
relationship type, it is straightforward to explain its meaning. Otherwise, if the rela-
tion corresponds to a mixture of multiple entities and relationships, semantic ambi-
guities will result and the relation cannot be easily explained.

Examples of Violating Guideline 1. The relation schemas in Figures 14.3(a)
and 14.3(b) also have clear semantics. (‘The reader should ignore the lines under the
relations for now; they are used to illustrate functional dependency notation, dis-
cussed in Section 14.2.) A tuple in the EMP_DEPT relation schema in Figure 14.3(a)
represents a single employee but includes, along with the Dnumber (the identifier
for the department he/she works for), additional information—namely, the
name (Dname) of the department for which the employee works and the Social
Security number (Dmgr_ssn) of the department manager. For the EMP_PROJ rela-
tion in Figure 14.3(b), each tuple relates an employee to a project but also includes
