Topic Proportions

do not need any training sets or human annotations to perform this thematic
extrapolation. The concept of this class of algorithms is as follows: Every document
is inherently organized thematically. For example, documents about Barack Obama
may mention other presidents, other issues related to the government, or a particular
political theme. An article about one of the Iron Man movies may contain refer-
ences to other sci-fi (science fiction) characters from the Marvel series or generally
have a sci-fi theme. These inherent structures in documents can be extracted by
probabilistic modeling and estimation methods. As another example, let us assume
that every document is made up of a collection of different topics in differing pro-
portions (e.g., a document about politics may also be about presidents and Ameri-
can history). Also, every topic is made up of a collection of words.

By considering Figure 27.6, we can guess that document D, which mentions U.S.
Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, can belong to the topics Presidents,
Politics, Democrats, Republicans, and Government. In general, topics share a fixed
vocabulary of words. This vocabulary of words is extracted from the collection of
documents for which we wish to train the topic models. We generally choose the
number of topics we wish to extract from the collection. Every topic ranks words
differently according to how often a word is represented under a certain topic in
different documents. In Figure 27.6, the bars representing topic proportions should
all sum to 1. Document D primarily belongs to the topic Presidents, as shown in the
bar graph. Figure 27.6 depicts the topics related to Presidents along with the list of
words associated with this topic.

Probabilistic topic modeling estimates topic distributions using a learning algo-
rithm that assumes that documents can be generated as a mixture of topic propor-
tions. These topic proportion estimates are computed using sampling and
expectation maximization algorithms. An algorithm called latent Dirichlet alloca-
tion (LDA)? is used to generate the topic models. The model assumes a generative
process wherein documents are mixtures of latent topics and topics are distribu-
tions over words. A generative model randomly generates observable data given
