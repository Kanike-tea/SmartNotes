unconnected. The four-valued logic truth tables for the and, or, xor, and not primitives are shown in
Table.

The truth table for the other four gates is the same, except that the outputs are complemented. Note that
for the and gate, the output is 1 only when both inputs are | and the output is 0 if any input is 0.
Otherwise, if one input is x or z, the output is x. The output of the or gate is 0 if both inputs are 0, is 1 if
any input is 1, and is x otherwise.

We now present two examples of gate-level modeling. Both examples use identifiers having multiple bit
widths, called vectors. The syntax specifying a vector includes within square brackets two numbers
separated with a colon. The following Verilog statements specify two vectors:

output [0: 3] D;

wire [7: 0] SUM;
The first statement declares an output vector D with four bits, 0 through 3. The second declares a wire
vector SUM with eight bits numbered 7 through 0. (Note: The first (left-most) number (array index)
listed is always the most significant bit of the vector). The individual bits are specified within square
brackets, so D[2] specifies bit 2 of D . It is also possible to address parts (contiguous bits) of vectors.
For example, SUM[2: 0] specifies the three least significant bits of vector SUM.

HDL Example below shows the gate-level description of a two-to-four-line decoder.

module decoder_2x4_gates (D, A, B, enable);
output [0: 3] D;
input A,B;
input enable;
wire A_not,B_not, enable_not;

not
G1 (A_not, A),
G2 (B_not, B),
G3 (enable_not, enable);
nand
G4 (D[0], A_not, B_not, enable_not),
G5 (D[1], A_not, B, enable_not),
G6 (D[2], A, B_not, enable_not),
G7 (D[3], A, B, enable_not);

endmodule
This decoder has two data inputs A and B and an enable input E. The four outputs are specified with the
vector D. The wire declaration is for internal connections. Three not gates produce the complement of
the inputs, and four nand gates provide the outputs for D. Remember that the output is always listed
