Artificial heart

Figure: Schematic representation of artificial heart

There are two main types of artificial hearts:

1. total artificial hearts and

2. heart assist devices.
A total artificial heart is a self-contained device that completely replaces the functions of the
natural heart. It is used as a bridge to transplant, meaning it provides temporary support to a
patient while they are waiting for a heart transplant.
Heart assist devices, on the other hand, are devices that are surgically implanted into the heart
and work alongside the natural heart to support its functions. While these devices are still in
the early stages of development, they have the potential to greatly improve the survival and
well-being of people with heart disease.
