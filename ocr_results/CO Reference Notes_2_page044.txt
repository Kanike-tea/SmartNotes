SYNCHRONOUS DRAM
© The operations are directly synchronized with clock signal (Figure 8.8).
© The address and data connections are buffered by means of registers.
© The output of each sense amplifier is connected to a latch.
« A Read-operation causes the contents of all cells in the selected row to be loaded in these latches.
¢ Data held in latches that correspond to selected columns are transferred into data-output register.
© Thus, data becoming available on the data-output pins.

Figure 8.9 A burst read of length 4 in an SDRAM.

« First, the row-address is latched under control of RAS" signal (Figure 8.9).

* The memory typically takes 2 or 3 clock cycles to activate the selected row.

© Then, the column-address is latched under the control of CAS" signal.

« After a delay of one clock cycle, the first set of data bits is placed on the data-lines.

¢ SDRAM automatically increments column-address to access next 3 sets of bits in the selected row.
LATENCY & BANDWIDTH

* A good indication of performance is given by 2 parameters: 1) Latency 2) Bandwidth.

Latency

¢ It refers to the amount of time it takes to transfer a word of data to or from the memory.

For a transfer of single word, the latency provides the complete indication of memory performance.

For a block transfer, the latency denotes the time it takes to transfer the first word of data.
