e In Figure (A), the leftmost child of A is B, and the leftmost child of D is H.
e The closest right sibling of B is C, and the closest right sibling of H is I.
e Choose the nodes based on how the tree is drawn. The left child field of each node points
to its leftmost child (if any), and the right sibling field points to its closest right sibling
(if any).
Figure (D) shows the tree of Figure (A) redrawn using the left child-right sibling representation.

Representation as a Degree-Two Tree

To obtain the degree-two tree representation of a tree, simply rotate the right-sibling pointers
in a left child-right sibling tree clockwise by 45 degrees. This gives us the degree-two tree
displayed in Figure (E).

Figure (E): degree-two representation

In the degree-two representation, a node has two children as the left and right children.
