Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module-1

Memory allocation functions: In high level languages the data structures are fully defined
at compile time. Modern languages like C can allocate memory at execution this feature is
known as dynamic memory allocation.

Memory usage: Four memory management functions are used with dynamic memory. malloc, calloc
and realloc are used for memory allocation. The function free is used to return memory when it is not
used.

Heap: It is the unused memory allocated to the program When requests are made by memory
allocating functions, memory is allocated from the heap at run time.

When a malloc function is invoked requesting for memory, it allocates a block of memory that
contains the number of bytes specified in its parameter and returns a pointer to the start of the
allocated memory.

When the requested memory is not available the pointer NULL is returned.

e

Example: void *malloc(sizeof(int));
¢ The pointer returned by the malloc function can be type cast to the pointer of the required
type by making use of type cast expressions

: When memory locations allocated are no longer needed, they should be
freed by using the predefined function free.
