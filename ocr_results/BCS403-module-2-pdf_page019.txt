Database Management System [BCS403]

The general RENAME operation when applied to a relation R of degree n is denoted by any of the
following three forms:

1. psi, 82,..., Bn(R) p (tho) - RENAME operator
2. pS(R) S — new relation name
3. pyat, 2,....... Bn) (R) B:,By,.....Bn- new attribute names

The first expression renames both the relation and its attributes. Second renames the relation only
and the third renames the attributes only.If the attributes of R are (Ai, Ao, ..., An) in that order, then
each Aj is renamed as Bi.

Renaming in SQL is accomplished by aliasing using AS, as in the following example:
SELECT E.Fname AS First_name,
E.Lname AS Last_name,
E.Salary AS Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E
WHERE E.Dno=5,

2.3 Relational Algebra Operations from Set Theory
2.3.1 The UNION, INTERSECTION, and MINUS Operations

= UNION: The result of this operation, denoted by R U S, is a relation that includes all tuples
that are either in R or in S or in both R and S. Duplicate tuples are eliminated.

= INTERSECTION: The result of this operation, denoted by R 1 S, is a relation that includes
all tuples that are in both 2 and S.

=» SET DIFFERENCE (or MINUS): The result of this operation, denoted by R — S, is a
relation that includes all tuples that are in R but not in S.

Example: Consider the the following two relations: STUDENT & INSTRUCTOR

STUDENT INSTRUCTOR

Fn Ln Fname | Lname
Susan Yao John Smith
Ramesh | Shah Ricardo | Browne
Johnny Kohler Susan Yao
Barbara | Jones Francis | Johnson
Amy Ford Ramesh | Shah
