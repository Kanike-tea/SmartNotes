Example:

| E(G)={(a,d), (a,b), (d,b)}

Self Edges/Self Loops: Edges of the form(v,v) are called self edges or self loops . It is an edge
which starts and ends at the same vertex.

Example:
i
= L )
f (> (aa
a} pd ee 7

Mutigraph: A graph with multiple occurrences of the same edge is called a multigraph

Example:
A : Ce.

D
e> @3

Complete Graph: An undirected graph with n vertices and exactly n(n-1)/2 edges is said to be a
complete graph. Ina graph all pairs of vertices are connected by an edge.
Example : A complete graph with n=3 vertices

a

Adjacent Vertex

c [)
If (u,v) is an edge in E(G), then we say that the vertices u and v are adjacent and the edge(u,v) is
incident on vertices u and v.

Path: A path from vertex u to v in graph g is a sequence of vertices u,il,i2, ik,v such that
(u,il),(i1,12)......... (ik,v) are edges in E(G). if G’ is directed then the path consists of
<u,il>,<ili2>......... <ik,v> edges in E(G’).

The length of the path is the number of edges in it.
