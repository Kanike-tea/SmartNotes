8.3 Binary Relational Operations: JOIN and DIVISION

This combines each project tuple with its controlling department tuple into a single
tuple, and then combines that tuple with an employee tuple that is the department
manager. The net result is a consolidated relation in which each tuple contains this
project-department-manager combined information.

In SQL, JOIN can be realized in several different ways. The first method is to specify
the <join conditions> in the WHERE clause, along with any other selection condi-
tions. This is very common and is illustrated by queries Q1, Q1A, Q1B, Q2, and Q8
in Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, as well as by many other query examples in Chapters 6
and 7. The second way is to use a nested relation, as illustrated by queries Q4A
and Q16 in Section 7.1.2. Another way is to use the concept of joined tables, as
illustrated by the queries Q1A, Q1B, Q8B, and Q2A in Section 7.1.6. The construct
of joined tables was added to SQL2 to allow the user to specify explicitly all the
various types of joins, because the other methods were more limited. It also allows
the user to clearly distinguish join conditions from the selection conditions in the
WHERE clause.

8.3.3 A Complete Set of Relational Algebra Operations

It has been shown that the set of relational algebra operations {6, 1, U, p, -, x} isa
complete set; that is, any of the other original relational algebra operations can be
expressed as a sequence of operations from this set. For example, the INTERSECTION
operation can be expressed by using UNION and MINUS as follows:

RAS=(RUS)-((R-S)U(S-R))

Although, strictly speaking, INTERSECTION is not required, it is inconvenient to
specify this complex expression every time we wish to specify an intersection. As
another example, a JOIN operation can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT fol-
lowed by a SELECT operation, as we discussed:

RM <condition>S = O<condition>(R X S)

Similarly, a NATURAL JOIN can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT preceded by
RENAME and followed by SELECT and PROJECT operations. Hence, the various
JOIN operations are also not strictly necessary for the expressive power of the rela-
tional algebra. However, they are important to include as separate operations
because they are convenient to use and are very commonly applied in database
applications. Other operations have been included in the basic relational algebra
for convenience rather than necessity. We discuss one of these—the DIVISION
operation—in the next section.

8.3.4 The DIVISION Operation

The DIVISION operation, denoted by =, is useful for a special kind of query that
sometimes occurs in database applications. An example is Retrieve the names of
employees who work on all the projects that ‘John Smith’ works on. To express
this query using the DIVISION operation, proceed as follows. First, retrieve the
