Data Modeling Using the Entity-
Relationship (ER) Model

( onceptual modeling is a very important phase in
designing a successful database application. Gener-

ally, the term database application refers to a particular database and the associ-
ated programs that implement the database queries and updates. For example, a
BANK database application that keeps track of customer accounts would include
programs that implement database updates corresponding to customer deposits
and withdrawals. These programs would provide user-friendly graphical user inter-
faces (GUIs) utilizing forms and menus for the end users of the application—the
bank customers or bank tellers in this example. In addition, it is now common to
provide interfaces to these programs to BANK customers via mobile devices using
mobile apps. Hence, a major part of the database application will require the
design, implementation, and testing of these application programs. Traditionally,
the design and testing of application programs has been considered to be part of
software engineering rather than database design. In many software design tools, the
database design methodologies and software engineering methodologies are inter-
twined since these activities are strongly related.

In this chapter, we follow the traditional approach of concentrating on the database
structures and constraints during conceptual database design. The design of appli-
cation programs is typically covered in software engineering courses. We present
the modeling concepts of the entity-relationship (ER) model, which is a popular
high-level conceptual data model. This model and its variations are frequently used
for the conceptual design of database applications, and many database design tools
employ its concepts. We describe the basic data-structuring concepts and con-
straints of the ER model and discuss their use in the design of conceptual schemas
for database applications. We also present the diagrammatic notation associated
with the ER model, known as ER diagrams.
