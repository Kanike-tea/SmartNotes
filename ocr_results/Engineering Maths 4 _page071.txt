© We substitute these along with y = »F a, x” in (1) which results in an infinite

series with various powers of x equal to zero.

[It is evident that this will be satisfied only when the coefficients of the various powers ofx are
equal to zero.]

© We equate the coefficients of various powers of x (starting from the lowest power of
x) to zero. In general when the coefficient of x” is equated to zero, we obtain a
recurrence relation ‘which will helps us to determine the constants

Thus we get the power series solution of the ODE in the form; ‘
¥ = a F(x) +a, G(x)

where F(x) and G(x) are convergent infinite series in x.

Remarks : ,

1. The method is adoptable for first order DEs also.

2. Sometimes we:can recognize the functions F ( x) and G(x) represented by convergent .
