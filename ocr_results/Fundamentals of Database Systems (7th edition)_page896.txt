Heterogeneity

complete autonomy but a total lack of distribution and heterogeneity (point A in
the figure). We see that the degree of local autonomy provides further ground for
classification into federated and multidatabase systems. At one extreme of the
autonomy spectrum, we have a DDBMS that looks like a centralized DBMS to the
user, with zero autonomy (point B). A single conceptual schema exists, and all
access to the system is obtained through a site that is part of the DDBMS—which
means that no local autonomy exists. Along the autonomy axis we encounter two
types of DDBMSs called federated database system (point C) and multidatabase
system (point D). In such systems, each server is an independent and autonomous
centralized DBMS that has its own local users, local transactions, and DBA, and
hence has a very high degree of local autonomy. The term federated database
system (FDBS) is used when there is some global view or schema of the federation
of databases that is shared by the applications (point C). On the other hand, a
multidatabase system has full local autonomy in that it does not have a global
schema but interactively constructs one as needed by the application (point D).
Both systems are hybrids between distributed and centralized systems, and the
distinction we made between them is not strictly followed. We will refer to them as
FDBSs in a generic sense. Point D in the diagram may also stand for a system with
full local autonomy and full heterogeneity—this could be a peer-to-peer database
system. In a heterogeneous FDBS, one server may be a relational DBMS, another a
network DBMS (such as Computer Associates’ IDMS or HP’S IMAGE/3000), and
