Bioprinting Materials
Bioprinting materials, also known as bioinks, are specifically designed to be compatible
with living cells and provide a supportive environment for their growth and organization. Here
are some examples of commonly used bioprinting materials:

Hydrogels:

Hydrogels are water-based polymer networks that closely mimic the extracellular matrix
(ECM) found in living tissues. They offer excellent biocompatibility, mechanical support, and
can be formulated to have similar physical properties to native tissues. Examples of hydrogels
used as bioinks include:

e Gelatin-based hydrogels
e Alginate hydrogels

e  Fibrin-based hydrogels

e Collagen-based hydrogels

Cell-laden Aggregates:

In some cases, cells are first aggregated into biomolecules and biomaterials (or
microtissues) before being incorporated into the bioink. These aggregates provide a more
physiological environment for the cells and enhance their viability and functionality.

Decellularized Extracellular Matrix ((ECM):

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of molecules surrounding cells in
tissues and organs. It provides structural support, biochemical signaling, and regulatory
functions.

The ECM of tissues can be extracted and processed to remove cellular components,
resulting in a decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM). dECM bioinks contain natural
signaling molecules and proteins that promote cell attachment, growth, and differentiation.
Examples of dECM bioinks include:

e Decellularized porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS)
