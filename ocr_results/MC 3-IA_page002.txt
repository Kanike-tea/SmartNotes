2.2 Interrupt Latency

Interrupt latency—the interval of time from an external interrupt request signal being raised to

the first fetch of an instruction of a specific interrupt service routine (ISR).

Interrupt latency depends on a combination of hardware and software. System architects must
balance the system design to handle multiple simultaneous interrupt sources and minimize
interrupt latency. If the interrupts are not handled in a timely manner, then the system will

exhibit slow response times.

Software handlers have two main methods to minimize interrupt latency. The first method is to

use a nested interrupt handler, which allows further interrupts to occur even when currently

servicing an existing interrupt (see Figure 3). This

s achieved by re enabling the interrupts as

soon as the interrupt source has been serviced (so it won’t generate more interrupts) but before

the interrupt handling is complete. Once a nested interrupt has been serviced, then control is

relinquished to the original interrupt service routine.

The second method involves prioritization. You program the interrupt controller to ignore
interrupts of the same or lower priority than the interrupt you are handling, so only a higher-

priority task can interrupt your handler. You then reenable interrupts.

The processor spends time in the lower-priority interrupts until a higher-priority interrupt occurs.
Therefore higher-priority interrupts have a lower average interrupt latency than the lower-
priority interrupts, which reduces latency by speeding up the completion time on the critical

time-sensitive interrupts.
