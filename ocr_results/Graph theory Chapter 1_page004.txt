For the digraph shown in Figure 1.7, the out-degrees and the in-degrees of the vertices are
as given below:

a(y)=2, d-(y)=1,
ayy=1,  d-(vn) =3,
d*(vy)=1, — d°(v3) =2,
d*(v4)=0, — d-(v4) =0,
d*(v5)=2, — d-(vs) =1,
d*(v6)=2, — d7(v6) = 1.
We note that, in the above digraph, there is a directed loop at the vertex v3 and this loop
contributes a count | to each of d*(v3) and d~(v3),

We further observe that the above digraph has 6 vertices and 8 edges and that the sums of
the out-degrees and in-degrees of its vertices are

This illustrates the following property common to all digraphs. This property is referred to
as the First Theorem of the Digraph Theory.

Property : In every digraph D, the sum of the out-degrees of all vertices is equal to the sum of
the in-degrees of all vertices, each sum being equal to the number of edges in D.

Proof: Suppose D has n vertices vj, v2,...,V_ and m edges. Let r; be the number of edges
going out of vy, r2 be the number of edges going out of v2, and so on. Then

d*(vy)=r, d*(v2)=12,..., d*(vn) =r.
Since every edge terminates at some vertex and since there are m edges, we should have

n+ ter ti =m,

Accordingly,

A" (yj) +d" (V2) +0 +d (Un) = ry tn ty =m.
_ Similarly, if 5; is the number of edges coming into vj, s2 is the number of edges coming
into v2, and so on, we get

d-(v1) +d" (v2) ++ +d (Vp) = 5, + 8) Hoo + 5, =m. a
