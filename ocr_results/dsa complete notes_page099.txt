Memory representation of threaded Tree

The variable root points to the header node of the tree, while root > leftChild points to the start of
the first node of the actual tree.

46.1 Inorder Traversal of a Threaded Binary Tree

By using the threads, we can perform an inorder traversal without making use of a stack.
e For any node, ptr, in a threaded binary tree, if ptr — rightThread = TRUE, the
inorder successor of ptr is ptr — rightChild by definition of the threads.
e Otherwise we obtain the inorder successor of ptr by following a path of left-child links from
the right-child of ptr until we reach a node with leftThread = TRUE.

Finding the inorder successor of a node: The function insuce finds the inorder successor of any
node in a threaded tree without using a stack.

ThreadNode * insucc(ThreadNode *tree)

{

ThreadNode * temp;

temp = tree—rightChild;

if (tree—rightThread—’f)

while (temp—leftThread==’f’)

temp = temp—leftChild;
return temp;

}

Inorder traversal of a threaded binary tree

¢ To perform an inorder traversal we make repeated calls to insucc
e This function assumes that the tree is pointed to by the header node's left child and that the
header node's right thread is FALSE.
