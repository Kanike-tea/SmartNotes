13.4 Storing and Extracting XML Documents
from Databases

Several approaches to organizing the contents of XML documents to facilitate their
subsequent querying and retrieval have been proposed. The following are the most
common approaches:

1. Using a file system or a DBMS to store the documents as text. An XML
document can be stored as a text file within a traditional file system. Alter-
natively, a relational DBMS can be used to store whole XML documents as
text fields within the DBMS recordss. This approach can be used if the
DBMS has a special module for document processing, and it would work for
storing schemaless and document-centric XML documents.

2. Using a DBMS to store the document contents as data elements. This
approach would work for storing a collection of documents that follow a
specific XML DTD or XML schema. Because all the documents have the
same structure, one can design a relational database to store the leaf-level
data elements within the XML documents. This approach would require
mapping algorithms to design a database schema that is compatible with the
XML document structure as specified in the XML schema or DTD and to
re-create the XML documents from the stored data. These algorithms can be
implemented either as an internal DBMS module or as separate middleware
that is not part of the DBMS. If all elements in an XML document have IDs,
a simple representation would be to have a table with attributes XDOC(Cld,
Pld, Etag, Val) where CID and Pld are the parent and child element IDs,
Etag is the name of the element of the Cid, and Val is the value if it is a leaf
node, assuming all values are the same type.

3. Designing a specialized system for storing native XML data. A new type
of database system based on the hierarchical (tree) model could be designed
and implemented. Such systems are referred to as native XML DBMSs. The
system would include specialized indexing and querying techniques and
would work for all types of XML documents. It could also include data com-
pression techniques to reduce the size of the documents for storage. Tamino
by Software AG and the Dynamic Application Platform of eXcelon are two
popular products that offer native XML DBMS capability. Oracle also offers
a native XML storage option.

4. Creating or publishing customized XML documents from preexisting
relational databases. Because there are enormous amounts of data already
stored in relational databases, parts of this data may need to be formatted as
documents for exchanging or displaying over the Web. This approach would
use a separate middleware software layer to handle the conversions needed
between the relational data and the extracted XML documents. Section 13.6
discusses this approach, in which data-centric XML documents are extracted
from existing databases, in more detail. In particular, we show how tree
structured documents can be created from flat relational databases that have
