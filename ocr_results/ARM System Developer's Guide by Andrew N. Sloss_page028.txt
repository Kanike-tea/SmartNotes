1.5 Summary 15

These two categories of operating system are not mutually exclusive: there are operat-
ing systems that use an ARM core with a memory management unit and have real-time
characteristics. ARM has developed a set of processor cores that specifically target each
category.

1.4.3. APPLICATIONS

‘The operating system schedules applications—code dedicated to handling a particular task.
An application implements a processing task; the operating system controls the environ-
ment. An embedded system can have one active application or several applications running
simultaneously.

ARM processors are found in numerous market segments, including networking, auto-
motive, mobile and consumer devices, mass storage, and imaging. Within each segment
ARM processors can be found in multiple applications.

For example, the ARM processor is found in networking applications like home
gateways, DSL modems for high-speed Internet communication, and 802.11] wireless
communication. The mobile device segment is the largest application area for ARM pro-
cessors because of mobile phones. ARM processors are also found in mass storage devices
such as hard drives and imaging products such as inkjet printers—applications that are cost
sensitive and high volume.

In contrast, ARM processors are not found in applications that require leading-edge
high performance. Because these applications tend to be low volume and high cost, ARM.
has decided not to focus designs on these types of applications.

1.5 SUMMARY

Pure RISC is aimed at high performance, but ARM uses a modified RISC design philosophy
that also targets good code density and low power consumption. An embedded system
consists of a processor core surrounded by caches, memory, and peripherals. The system is
controlled by operating system software that manages application tasks.

The key points in a RISC design philosophy are to improve performance by reducing
the complexity of instructions, to speed up instruction processing by using a pipeline, to
provide a large register set to store data near the core, and to use a load-store architecture.

The ARM design philosophy also incorporates some non-RISC ideas:

= It allows variable cycle execution on certain instructions to save power, area, and
code size.
= It adds a barrel shifter to expand the capability of certain instructions.

= = It uses the Thumb 16-bit instruction set to improve code density.
