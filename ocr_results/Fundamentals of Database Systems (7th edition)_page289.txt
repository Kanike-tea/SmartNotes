to the relational algebra
expression for Q2,

node (2) must begin to execute and produce results before node (3) can start execution,
and so on. In general, a query tree gives a good visual representation and understand-
ing of the query in terms of the relational operations it uses and is recommended as
an additional means for expressing queries in relational algebra. We will revisit query
trees when we discuss query processing and optimization in Chapters 18 and 19.

8.4 Additional Relational Operations

Some common database requests—which are needed in commercial applications
for RDBMSs—cannot be performed with the original relational algebra operations
described in Sections 8.1 through 8.3. In this section we define additional opera-
tions to express these requests. These operations enhance the expressive power of
the original relational algebra.

8.4.1 Generalized Projection

The generalized projection operation extends the projection operation by allowing
functions of attributes to be included in the projection list. The generalized form
can be expressed as:

Tri, F2, .., Fn (R)

where F), F, ... , F, are functions over the attributes in relation R and may involve
arithmetic operations and constant values. This operation is helpful when devel-
oping reports where computed values have to be produced in the columns of a
query result.
