Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases

except that instance variables may be encapsulated within the object and thus are
not necessarily visible to external users. Instance variables may also be of arbitrarily
complex data types. Object-oriented systems allow definition of the operations or
functions (behavior) that can be applied to objects of a particular type. In fact, some
OO models insist that all operations a user can apply to an object must be pre-
defined. This forces a complete encapsulation of objects. This rigid approach has
been relaxed in most OO data models for two reasons. First, database users often
need to know the attribute names so they can specify selection conditions on the
attributes to retrieve specific objects. Second, complete encapsulation implies that
any simple retrieval requires a predefined operation, thus making ad hoc queries
difficult to specify on the fly.

To encourage encapsulation, an operation is defined in two parts. The first part,
called the signature or interface of the operation, specifies the operation name and
arguments (or parameters). The second part, called the method or body, specifies
the implementation of the operation, usually written in some general-purpose pro-
gramming language. Operations can be invoked by passing a message to an object,
which includes the operation name and the parameters. The object then executes
the method for that operation. This encapsulation permits modification of the
internal structure of an object, as well as the implementation of its operations, with-
out the need to disturb the external programs that invoke these operations. Hence,
encapsulation provides a form of data and operation independence (see Chapter 2).

Another key concept in OO systems is that of type and class hierarchies and inheri-
tance. This permits specification of new types or classes that inherit much of their
structure and/or operations from previously defined types or classes. This makes it
easier to develop the data types of a system incrementally and to reuse existing type
definitions when creating new types of objects.

One problem in early OO database systems involved representing relationships
among objects. The insistence on complete encapsulation in early OO data models
led to the argument that relationships should not be explicitly represented, but
should instead be described by defining appropriate methods that locate related
objects. However, this approach does not work very well for complex databases
with many relationships because it is useful to identify these relationships and make
them visible to users. The ODMG object database standard has recognized this
need and it explicitly represents binary relationships via a pair of inverse references,
as we will describe in Section 12.3.

Another OO concept is operator overloading, which refers to an operation’s ability
to be applied to different types of objects; in such a situation, an operation name
may refer to several distinct implementations, depending on the type of object it is
applied to. This feature is also called operator polymorphism. For example, an oper-
ation to calculate the area of a geometric object may differ in its method (imple-
mentation), depending on whether the object is of type triangle, circle, or rectangle.
This may require the use of late binding of the operation name to the appropriate
method at runtime, when the type of object to which the operation is applied
becomes known.
