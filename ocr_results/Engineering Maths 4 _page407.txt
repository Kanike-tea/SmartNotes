ae that sexes are born in ae proportion, probability of female birth is equal
‘o

Thatis, p = 1/2:and ients.4 g=1/2
: ~~ difference in proportions = 05- 0.46. = = 0.04

S.D proportion of females = — = coe ab, 2 i oe i
ae x 1/2 x 17500 ='0.0224 ela $ 4 ;

Thus we conclude that the figures are conformal with the sypiiciesis that the
sexes are born in equal proportions.

13. In 324 throws of a six faced ‘die’, an odd number turned ap 181 times. Is it reasonable to
think that the ‘die’ is an unbiased one ? gg

>> Probability of the tun up of an odd number i is p = 3/6 = 1/2, .. i
Hence q = 1-p = 1/2 ;
Expected number of successes = 1/2 x 324 = 162

Observed number of successes = 181 pe

14. A’die’ is thrown 9000 times and a throw of 3. or 4% was observed 3240 times. Show that the
die cannot be regarded as. an unbiassed one. .

>> Probability of getting 3 or 4 a throw is p= = 2/6 = V3 and
g=1-p=22

*. expected number of successes 13 x .9000 = 3000
Observed number of successes = 3240
The difference = 3240-3000 ='240

Since Z = 5.37 > 2.58 we conclude that the die is biassed.

Consider Z =
