Microcontrollers-BCS402

hardware portion of Jazelle only supports a subset of the Java bytecodes; the rest are
emulated in software.

Jazelle instruction set features.

Jazelle (cpsr T = 0, J = 1)

Instruction size 8-bit
Core instructions | Over 60% of the Java bytecodes are implemented in hardware;
the rest of the codes are implemented in software.

Interrupt Mask:

Interrupt masks are used to stop specific interrupt requests from interrupting the processor.
There are two interrupt request levels available on the ARM processor core—interrupt
request (IRQ) and fast interrupt request (FIQ).

The cpsr has two interrupt mask bits, 7 and 6 (or I and F), which control the masking of IRQ
and FIQ, respectively. The I bit masks IRQ when set to binary 1, and similarly the F bit

masks FIQ when set to binary 1.

Condition Flags:

Condition flags are updated by comparisons and the result of ALU operations that specify the
S instruction suffix. For example, if a SUBS subtract instruction results in a register value of
zero, then the Z flag in the cpsr is set. This particular subtract instruction specifically updates
the cpsr.

Condition flags.

Flag Flag name Set when
Q Saturation the result causes an overflow and/or saturation
Vv oVerflow the result causes a signed overflow
Cc Carry the result causes an unsigned carry
Z Zero the result is zero, frequently used to indicate equality
N Negative bit 31 of the result is a binary 1
