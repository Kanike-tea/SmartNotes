Step 3: Mapping of Binary 1:1 Relationship Types
= For each binary 1:1 relationship type R in the ER schema, identify the relations S and T that
correspond to the entity types participating in R
= There are three possible approaches:
- foreign key approach
- merged relationship approach
- crossreference or relationship relation approach
1. The foreign key approach
= Choose one of the relations—S, say—and include as a foreign key in S' the primary key of T.
= It is better to choose an entity type with total participation in R in the role of S
= Include all the simple attributes (or simple components of composite attributes) of the 1:1
relationship type R as attributes of S.
= In our example, we map the 1:1 relationship type by choosing the participating entity type
DEPARTMENT to serve in the role of S because its participation in the MANAGES
relationship type is total
= We include the primary key of the EMPLOYEE relation as foreign key in the
DEPARTMENT relation and rename it Mgr_ssn.
= We also include the simple attribute Start_date of the MANAGES relationship type in the
DEPARTMENT relation and rename it Mgr_start_date

Merged relation approach:

= merge the two entity types and the relationship into a single relation

" This is possible when both participations are total, as this would indicate that the two

tables will have the exact same number of tuples at all times.

3.Cross-reference or relationship relation approach:

* set up a third relation R for the purpose of cross-referencing the primary keys of the two
relations S.and T representing the entity types.

= required for binary M:N relationships

= The relation R is called a relationship relation (or sometimes a lookup table), because each
tuple in R represents a relationship instance that relates one tuple from S with one tuple
from T

= The relation R will include the primary key attributes of S and T as foreign keys to S and T.

= The primary key of R will be one of the two foreign keys, and the other foreign key will be
a unique key of R.
