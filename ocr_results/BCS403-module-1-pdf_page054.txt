3.8 Specialization and Generalization

3.8.1 Specialization

For example, the set of subclasses {SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN} is a
specialization of the superclass EMPLOYEE that distinguishes among employee entities based on
the job type of each employee entity. We may have several specializations of the:same entity type
based on different distinguishing characteristics. For example, another specialization of the
EMPLOYEE entity type may yield the set of subclasses {SALARIED EMPLOYEE,
HOURLY_EMPLOYEE}; this specialization distinguishes among employees based on the method

of pay.

Figure 3.8.1(a): EER diagram notation to represent subclasses and specialization.
Figure 3.8.1(a) shows how we represent a specialization diagrammatically in an EER diagram. The
subclasses that define a specialization are attached by lines to a circle that represents the
specialization, which is connected in turn to the superclass. The subset symbol on each line
connecting a subclass to the circle indicates the direction of the superclass/subclass relationship.5

Attributes that apply only to entities of a particular subclass—such as TypingSpeed of
