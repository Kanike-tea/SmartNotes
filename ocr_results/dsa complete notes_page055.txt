Data Structures and Applications(BCS304) Module 2

If the position is on the border then there are less than eight directions. To avoid checking for border
conditions the maze can be surrounded by a border of ones. Thus an m*p maize will require an
(m+2)*(p+2) array the entrance is at position [1][1] and exit is at [m][p]. The possible direction to
move can be predefined in an array move as shown below where the eight possible directions are
numbered from 0 to 7. For each direction we indicate the vertical and horizontal offset.

typedef struct offset
{

Int vert;

Int horiz;

Offset move[8];

Table of moves: The array moves is initialized according to the table given below.

Name | Dir | Move[dir].vert Move[dir]horiz
N 0 -1 0

NE 1 -1 1

E 2 0 1

SE 3 1 1

Ss 4 1 0

SW 5 1 -1

WwW 6 0 -1

NW 7 -1 -1

As we move through the maze, we may have the choice of several directions of movement. Since we
do not know the best choice we save our current position and arbitrarily pick a possible move. By
saving the current position we can return to it and try another path. A second two dimensional array
can be maintained to keep track of the visited locations. The maze can be implemented by making use
of a stack where the element is defined as follows.

typedef struct element

{
int row;
int col;
int dir;
