or
<attribute name> <comparison op> <attribute name>

where <attribute name> is the name of an attribute of R, <comparison op> is nor-
mally one of the operators {=, <, <, >, 2, #}, and <constant value> is a constant
value from the attribute domain. Clauses can be connected by the standard Boolean
operators and, or, and not to form a general selection condition. For example, to
select the tuples for all employees who either work in department 4 and make over
$25,000 per year, or work in department 5 and make over $30,000, we can spec:
the following SELECT operation:

© (Dno=4 AND Salary>25000) OR (Dno=6 AND Salary>30000)(EMPLOYEE)
The result is shown in Figure 8.1(a).

Notice that all the comparison operators in the set {=, <, <, >, 2, #} can apply to
attributes whose domains are ordered values, such as numeric or date domains.
Domains of strings of characters are also considered to be ordered based on the col-
lating sequence of the characters. If the domain of an attribute is a set of unordered
values, then only the comparison operators in the set {=, #} can be used. An exam-
ple of an unordered domain is the domain Color = { ‘red’, ‘blue’, ‘green’, ‘white’,
‘yellow’, ...}, where no order is specified among the various colors. Some domains
allow additional types of comparison operators; for example, a domain of character
strings may allow the comparison operator SUBSTRING_OF.
