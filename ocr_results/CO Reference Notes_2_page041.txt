¢ The data-input and data-output of each Sense/Write circuit are connected to a single bidirectional data-
line.
* Data-line can be connected to a data-bus of the computer.
© Following 2 control lines are also used:
1) R/W’ > Specifies the required operation.
CS’ > Chip Select input selects a given chip in the multi-chipmemory

Figure 8.4 A static RAM cell,
1) Two inverters are cross connected to form a latch (Figure 8.4).
2) The latch is connected to 2-bit-lines by transistors T] and T2.
3) The transistors act as switches that can be opened/closed under the control of the word-line.
4) When the word-line is at ground level, the transistors are turned off and the latch retain its state.

Read Operation
© To read the state of the cell, the word-line is activated to close switches T1 and T2.
¢ If the cell is in state 1, the signal on bit-line b is high and the signal on the bit-line b" is low.
© Thus, b and b“ are complement of each other.
¢ Sense/Write circuit
— monitors the state of b & b* and
— sets the output accordingly.
