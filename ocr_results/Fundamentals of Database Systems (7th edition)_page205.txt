The relational model was introduced by Codd (1970) in a classic paper. Codd also
introduced relational algebra and laid the theoretical foundations for the relational
model in a series of papers (Codd, 1971, 1972, 1972a, 1974); he was later given the
Turing Award, the highest honor of the ACM (Association for Computing Machin-
ery) for his work on the relational model. In a later paper, Codd (1979) discussed
extending the relational model to incorporate more meta-data and semantics about
the relations; he also proposed a three-valued logic to deal with uncertainty in rela-
tions and incorporating NULLs in the relational algebra. The resulting model is
known as RM/T. Childs (1968) had earlier used set theory to model databases.
Later, Codd (1990) published a book examining over 300 features of the relational
data model and database systems. Date (2001) provides a retrospective review and
analysis of the relational data model.

Since Codd’s pioneering work, much research has been conducted on various
aspects of the relational model. Todd (1976) describes an experimental DBMS
called PRTV that directly implements the relational algebra operations. Schmidt
and Swenson (1975) introduce additional semantics into the relational model by
classifying different types of relations. Chen’s (1976) entity-relationship model,
which is discussed in Chapter 3, is a means to communicate the real-world seman-
tics of a relational database at the conceptual level. Wiederhold and Elmasri (1979)
introduce various types of connections between relations to enhance its constraints.
Extensions of the relational model are discussed in Chapters 11 and 26. Additional
bibliographic notes for other aspects of the relational model and its languages, sys-
tems, extensions, and theory are given in Chapters 6 to 9, 14, 15, 23, and 30. Maier
(1983) and Atzeni and De Antonellis (1993) provide an extensive theoretical treat-
ment of the relational data model.
