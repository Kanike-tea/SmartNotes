44 Chapter 2. ARM Processor Fundamentals

=) ~=Memory management is used to organize memory and protect system resources.

=~ Coprocessors are used to extend the instruction set and functionality. Coprocessor
15 controls the cache, TCMs, and memory management.

An ARM processor is an implementation of a specific instruction set architecture (ISA).
The ISA has been continuously improved from the first ARM processor design. Processors
are grouped into implementation families (ARM7, ARM9, ARM10, and ARM11) with
similar characteristics.
