Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module-1

These errors are difficult to debug and correct, therefore a pointer should always be initialized with a
valid memory address.

NOTE: A pointer variable can only point at a variable of the same type.
We can have more than one pointer variable pointing at the same variable. For example
int a;
int *p,*q;
p=&a;
q=&a;
now both the pointer variable p and q are pointing at the same variable a. There is no limit to the
number of pointer variable that can point to a variable.

Accessing variables through pointers
e A Variable can be accessed through a pointer variable by using an indirection operator.
e Indirection operator(*): An indirection operator is a unary operator whose operand must be a
pointer value.
e For example to access a variable a through a pointer variable p we have to code it as follows

Void main()
{
int a=5;
int *p
p=&a;// p is now pointing at a
*p=*ptl

printf“ %d %d %p”, a, *p,p);

}
Output: 6 6 XXXXX(address of variable a)
Now the value of a is modified through the pointer variable p

Note:
> we need parenthesis for expressions like (*p) ++ as the precedence of postfix increment is
more than precedence of the indirection operator (*). If the parenthesis is not used the address
will be incremented.
> The indirection and the address operators are the inverse of each other when combined in an
expression such as *&a they cancel each other
