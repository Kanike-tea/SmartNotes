Laboratory Exercises

Illustrate the UML diagram for Exercise 3.16. Your UML design should
observe the following requirements:

a. A student should have the ability to compute his/her GPA and add or
drop majors and minors.

b. Each department should be able to add or delete courses and hire or ter-
minate faculty.

c. Each instructor should be able to assign or change a student’s grade for a
course.

Note: Some of these functions may be spread over multiple classes.

Consider the UNIVERSITY database described in Exercise 3.16. Build the ER
schema for this database using a data modeling tool such as ERwin or
Rational Rose.

Consider a MAIL_ORDER database in which employees take orders for parts
from customers. The data requirements are summarized as follows:

= The mail order company has employees, each identified by a unique em-
ployee number, first and last name, and Zip Code.

= Each customer of the company is identified by a unique customer number,
first and last name, and Zip Code.

= Each part sold by the company is identified by a unique part number, a
part name, price, and quantity in stock.

= Each order placed by a customer is taken by an employee and is given a
unique order number. Each order contains specified quantities of one or
more parts. Each order has a date of receipt as well as an expected ship
date. The actual ship date is also recorded.

Design an entity-relationship diagram for the mail order database and build
the design using a data modeling tool such as ERwin or Rational Rose.

Consider a MOVIE database in which data is recorded about the movie
industry. The data requirements are summarized as follows:

= Each movie is identified by title and year of release. Each movie has a
length in minutes. Each has a production company, and each is classified
under one or more genres (such as horror, action, drama, and so forth).
Each movie has one or more directors and one or more actors appear in it.
Each movie also has a plot outline. Finally, each movie has zero or more
quotable quotes, each of which is spoken by a particular actor appearing
in the movie.

= Actors are identified by name and date of birth and appear in one or more
movies. Each actor has a role in the movie.
