e Potential for broader use: RNA vaccines have the potential to be used in the
prevention of other infectious diseases, such as influenza, HIV, and Zika, as well

as in the treatment of cancer.

Proteins as Food

Proteins are essential nutrients that provide the body with amino acids, which are the
building blocks of the body's tissues. Proteins are found in many different foods, including
meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, beans, lentils, tofu, and eggs.

Proteins are a vital component of a healthy diet, as they help to build and repair tissues, support
immune function, and regulate various metabolic processes. The body also uses proteins as a
source of energy when carbohydrates and fats are not available.

The quality of proteins in food is determined by the types of amino acids they contain,
as well as the amount of each type of amino acid. To ensure adequate protein intake, it is
important to consume a variety of protein-rich foods and to include both complete and
incomplete protein sources in the diet. It is also important to consume sufficient amounts of
other nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins and minerals, to support overall health

and well-being.

Whey protein as food

Whey protein is a type of protein derived from the liquid that separates from milk during
the cheese-making process.

It is a complete protein, meaning it contains all of the essential amino acids the body needs to
build and repair tissues.

Whey protein is widely used as a dietary supplement, particularly by athletes,
bodybuilders, and people looking to increase their protein intake. It is commonly added to
smoothies, shakes, and other beverages, and is also available in powder form that can be mixed
into other foods or beverages. Compared to other types of protein, whey protein is rapidly
absorbed by the body and is high in branched-chain amino acids, which are essential for muscle
growth and repair. It is also a good source of essential nutrients, including calcium, potassium,

and vitamins B2 and B12.
