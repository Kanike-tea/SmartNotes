LAB PROGRAM 04 (a)
4a) Write a Python program to Demonstrate how to Draw a Bar Plot using Matplotlib.
Aim: Demonstration of how to draw a bar plot using matplotlib.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

The below program demonstrates how to draw a bar plot using Matplotlib. Make sure you have
Matplotlib installed before running this code. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

pip install matplotlib

1. Import Matplotlib: The script begins by importing the ‘pyplot’ module from the
Matplotlib library as p1t. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python,
and ‘pyplot’ is a subpackage that provides a simple interface for creating various types
of plots, including bar plots.

2. Define Sample Data: Two lists are defined: ‘categories’ and ‘values’. These lists
represent the categories (e.g., labels) and corresponding values (e.g., numerical data
points) that will be used to create the bar plot. In this case, there are four categories and
their respective values.

3. Create a Bar Plot: The ‘plt.bar()’ function is used to create a bar plot. This
function takes two arguments: the first argument is the list of categories (x-axis), and the
second argument is the list of values (y-axis). Additionally, the ‘color’ parameter is set
to 'green', specifying the color of the bars in the plot.

4. Add Labels and Title: The ‘plt.xlabel()’, ‘plt.ylabel()’, and
‘plt.title()’ functions are used to add labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and a title to the
plot, respectively. In this example, 'Categories' is set as the x-axis label, 'Values' as the y-
axis label, and 'Bar Plot Example' as the title.

5. Display the Plot: Finally, the plt.show() function is called to display the created bar
plot on the screen. This function is essential for showing the plot to the user. It should be

the last line of the script.

When you run this program, it will generate a bar plot with the specified categories on the x-axis
and their corresponding values on the y-axis, labeled and titled as described, and display the plot

in a graphical window.
