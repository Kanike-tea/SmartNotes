Examples in Neo4j using the Cypher language. (a) Creating some nodes. (b) Creating some relationships.

(a) creating some nodes for the COMPANY data (from Figure 5.6):
CREATE (e1: EMPLOYEE, {Empid: ‘1’, Lname: ‘Smith’, Fname: ‘John’, Minit: ‘B’})
CREATE (e2: EMPLOYEE, {Empid: ‘2’, Lname: ‘Wong’, Fname: ‘Franklin’})
CREATE (e3: EMPLOYEE, {Empid: ‘3’, Lname: ‘Zelaya’, Fname: ‘Alicia’})
CREATE (e4: EMPLOYEE, {Empid: ‘4’, Lname: ‘Wallace’, Fname: ‘Jennifer’, Minit: ‘S’})

CREATE (d1:
CREATE (d2:

DEPARTMENT, {Dno: ‘5’, Dname: ‘Research’})
DEPARTMENT, {Dno: ‘4’, Dname: ‘Administration’})

CREATE (p1:
CREATE (p2:
CREATE (p3:
CREATE (p4:

PROJECT, {Pno:

PROJECT, {Pno:
PROJECT, {Pno:

‘4, Pname: ‘ProductX’})

10’, Pname: ‘Computerization’})
‘20’, Pname: ‘Reorganization’})

OCATION, {Lname:
OCATION, {Lname:

: LOCATION, {Lname:
CREATE (loc4: LOCATION, {Lname:

‘Houston’})
‘Stafford’})
‘Bellaire’))
‘Sugarland’})

(b) creating some relationships for the COMPANY data (from Figure 5.6):
