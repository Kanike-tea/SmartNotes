valuable loot that fits into his knapsack, think about a transport plane that has to
deliver the most valuable set of items to a remote location without exceeding the
plane’s capacity. Figure 3.8a presents a small instance of the knapsack problem.
The exhaustive-search approach to this problem leads to generating all the
subsets of the set of n items given, computing the total weight of each subset in
order to identify feasible subsets (i.e., the ones with the total weight not exceeding
the knapsack capacity), and finding a subset of the largest value among them. As
an example, the solution to the instance of Figure 3.8a is given in Figure 3.8b. Since
the number of subsets of an n-element set is 2”, the exhaustive search leads to a
Q(2") algorithm, no matter how efficiently individual subsets are generated.
Thus, for both the traveling salesman and knapsack problems considered
above, exhaustive search leads to algorithms that are extremely inefficient on
every input. In fact, these two problems are the best-known examples of so-
called NP-hard problems. No polynomial-time algorithm is known for any NP-
hard problem. Moreover, most computer scientists believe that such algorithms
do not exist, although this very important conjecture has never been proven.
More-sophisticated approaches—backtracking and branch-and-bound (see Sec-
tions 12.1 and 12.2)—enable us to solve some but not all instances of these and
