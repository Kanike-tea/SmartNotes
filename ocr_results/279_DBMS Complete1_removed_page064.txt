Domain Relational Calculus

1.

Domain relational calculus is another non procedural language for expressing database
queries.
A query is specified as:

{<X1,X2,...,Xn> | P(X1,X2,...,Xn)} where X1,X2,...,.Xn represents domain variables. P represent a

predicate formula as in tuple calculus

Since the domain variables are referred in place of tuples the formula doesn’t refer the fields

of tuples rather they refer the domain variables.
For example the queries in domain calculus are mentioned as follows:

o Find the branch-name, loan-number and amount for loans over Rs 1200.

{<b, l, a>] <b, ], a> € Loan Aa > 1200}

o Find the loan number for each loan of an amount greater that Rs1200.

{<1>] 3 ba( <b, |, a> € Loan Aa >1200}

o Find the names of all the customers who have a loan from the Sadar branch and find

the loan amount
{<ca>|3l(<c,1> €Borrower

3 b( <b, ],a>€ Loan A b="Sadar"))}

o Find names of all customers who have a loan , an account, or both at the Sadar

Branc
{<c>| 3 1(< c,]>€ Borrower (3 b, a(<b, |, a> € Loan A b="Sadar"))
V 3 a(<c,a> € Depositor A 3 b, n(<b, a,n> € Account A b ="Sadar"))}

o Find only those customers who have both an account and a loan.
{<c>| 3 l(<c, > € Borrower ) Al a(<c, a> € Depositor )}

o Find all customers who have an account but do not have loan.
{t| 3 a(<c, a> € Depositor ) A713 1(<c, l> € Borrower )}

Find all customers who have an account at all branches located in Agra
“tc c>| Vx,y, 2(<x, y, z> € Branch) Ay= “Agra">

Outer Join.

Outer join operation is an extension of join operation to deal with missing information
Suppose that we have following relational schemas:

Employee( employee-name, street, city)

Fulltime-works(employee-name, branch-name, salary)

A snapshot of these relations is as follows:

Employee: employee- street city
name
Ram MG Road Agra
Shyam New Mandi | Mathura
Road
Suleman Bhagat Singh | Aligarh
Road

Fulltime-works

employee- branch- salary
name name

Ram Sadar 30000
Shyam Sanjay Place | 20000
Rehman Dayalbagh 40000
