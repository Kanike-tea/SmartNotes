17.7 Physical Database Design
in Relational Databases

In this section, we discuss the physical design factors that affect the performance of
applications and transactions, and then we comment on the specific guidelines for
RDBMSs in the context of what we discussed in Chapter 16 and this chapter so far.

17.7.1 Factors That Influence Physical Database Design

Physical design is an activity where the goal is not only to create the appropriate
structuring of data in storage, but also to do so in a way that guarantees good per-
formance. For a given conceptual schema, there are many physical design alterna-
tives in a given DBMS. It is not possible to make meaningful physical design
decisions and performance analyses until the database designer knows the mix of
queries, transactions, and applications that are expected to run on the database.
This is called the job mix for the particular set of database system applications. The
database administrators/designers must analyze these applications, their expected
frequencies of invocation, any timing constraints on their execution speed, the
expected frequency of update operations, and any unique constraints on attributes.
We discuss each of these factors next.

A. Analyzing the Database Queries and Transactions. Before undertaking
the physical database design, we must have a good idea of the intended use of the
database by defining in a high-level form the queries and transactions that are
expected to run on the database. For each retrieval query, the following informa-
tion about the query would be needed:

- The files (relations) that will be accessed by the query
. The attributes on which any selection conditions for the query are specified
. Whether the selection condition is an equality, inequality, or a range condition

Pers

. The attributes on which any join conditions or conditions to link multiple
tables or objects for the query are specified

5. The attributes whose values will be retrieved by the query

The attributes listed in items 2 and 4 above are candidates for the definition of
access structures, such as indexes, hash keys, or sorting of the file.

For each update operation or update transaction, the following information
would be needed:
1. The files that will be updated
2. The type of operation on each file (insert, update, or delete)
3. The attributes on which selection conditions for a delete or update are specified
4. The attributes whose values will be changed by an update operation

Again, the attributes listed in item 3 are candidates for access structures on the files,
because they would be used to locate the records that will be updated or deleted. On
