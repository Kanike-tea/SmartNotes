Three record storage formats, (a) A fixed-length record with six fields and size of 71 bytes. (b) A record with
two variable-length fields and three fixed-length fields. (c) A variable-field record with three types of separator

characters.

A file of records with optional fields can be formatted in different ways. If the total
number of fields for the record type is large, but the number of fields that actually
appear in a typical record is small, we can include in each record a sequence of
<field-name, field-value> pairs rather than just the field values. Three types of sepa-
rator characters are used in Figure 16.5(c), although we could use the same separa-
tor character for the first two purposes—separating the field name from the field
value and separating one field from the next field. A more practical option is to
assign a short field type code—say, an integer number—to each field and include in
each record a sequence of <field-type, field-value> pairs rather than <field-name,
field-value> pairs.

A repeating field needs one separator character to separate the repeating values of
the field and another separator character to indicate termination of the field. Finally,
for a file that includes records of different types, each record is preceded by a record
