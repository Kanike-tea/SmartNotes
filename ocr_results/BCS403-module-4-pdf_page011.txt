Database Management System [BCS403]

Example: For each project, retrieve the project number, the project name, and the number of
employees who work on that project.

SELECT Pnumber, Pname, COUNT (*)

FROM PROJECT, WORKS_ON

WHERE Pnumber=Pno

GROUP BY Pnumber, Pname;
Above query shows how we can use a join condition in conjunction with GROUP BY. In this case,
the grouping and functions are applied after the joining of the two relations.

HAVING provides a condition on the summary information regarding the group of tuples associated.
with each value of the grouping attributes. Only the groups that satisfy the condition are retrieved in
the result of the query.

Example: For each project on which more than two employees work, retrieve the project number,
the project name, and the number of employees who work on the project.

SELECT Pnumber, Pname, COUNT (*)

FROM PROJECT, WORKS_ON

WHERE Pnumber=Pno

GROUP BY Pnumber, Pname

HAVING COUNT (*)> 2;
