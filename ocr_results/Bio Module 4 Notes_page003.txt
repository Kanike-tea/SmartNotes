e Early Sonar Development (late 19th century): The foundations of technological
echolocation were laid with the invention of the first practical underwater sound detection
device called the hydrophone. Developed by Reginald Fessenden in the late 19th century,
the hydrophone allowed for the detection of underwater sounds.

e World War I (early 20th century): During World War I, the need for detecting
submarines led to significant advancements in sonar technology. Active sonar systems
were developed, which involved the transmission of sound waves and the reception of
echoes to detect submerged objects.

e Further Advancements (mid-20th century): The mid-20th century saw continued
advancements in sonar technology, driven by military and scientific research. Sonar
systems were refined and improved for applications such as submarine detection,
underwater mapping, and marine research.

e Ultrasonic Applications (mid-20th century): In parallel with underwater sonar, ultrasonic
technology began to find applications in fields such as medicine, non-destructive testing,
and industrial imaging. Ultrasonic sensors were developed for detecting and ranging
objects based on the principles of echolocation.

e Evolution of Echolocation Technologies (late 20th century - present): As technology
advanced, more sophisticated echolocation systems emerged. Advancements in signal
processing, sensors, and algorithms allowed for improved resolution, accuracy, and
interpretation of echoes. Echolocation technologies found applications in various fields
including robotics, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.

Ultrasonography is a medical imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to
produce images of the internal organs and tissues of the body. It is also known as ultrasound
imaging or sonography.

The ultrasound machine emits high-frequency sound waves (usually in the range of 2 to
18 MHz) that travel through the body and bounce back off of the internal organs and tissues. The
returning echoes are captured by the ultrasound machine and used to create images of the
internal structures.
