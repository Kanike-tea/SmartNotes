Inserting a Node into a Threaded Binary Tree

In this case, the insertion of r as the right child of a node s is studied.
The cases for insertion are:
e If s has an empty right subtree, then the insertion is simple and diagrammed in Figure
e Ifthe right subtree of s is not empty, then this right subtree is made the right subtree of
r after insertion. When this is done, r becomes the inorder predecessor of a node that has
a leftThread == true field, and consequently there is a thread which has to be updated
to point to r. The node containing this thread was previously the inorder successor of s.

before (b) after

void insertRight(threadedPointer Sf threadedPointer r)
{  /* insert ras the right child of s */
threadedpointer temp;
r—rightChild = parent—rightChild;
r—rightThread = parent—rightThread;
r—leftChild = parent;
r—leftThread = TRUE;
s—rightChild = child;
s—rightThread = FALSE;
if (!r—rightThread) {
temp = insucc(r);
temp—leftChild = r;
