Database Management System [BCS403]

Hot Set Method:

= This is useful in queries that have to scan a set of pages repeatedly.

= The hot set method determines for each db processing algorithm the set of disk pages
that will be accessed repeatedly and it does not replace them until their processing is
completed.

The DBMIN method:

= uses a model known as QLSM (Query Locality set model), which predetermines the

pattern of page references for each algorithm for a particular db operation

= Depending on the type of access method, the file characteristics, and the algorithm

used the QLSM will estimate the number of main memory buffers needed for each file

involved in the operation.

5.4 Desirable Properties of Transactions

https://vtucode.in

Transactions should possess several.properties, often called the ACID properties
A Atomicity: a transaction is an atomic unit of processing and it is either performed

entirely or not at all.
C_ Consistency Preservation: a transaction should be consistency preserving that is it
must take the database from one consistent state to another.
| Isolation/Independence: A transaction should appear as though it is being executed
in isolation from other transactions, even though many transactions are executed
concurrently.
D Durability (or Permanency): if a transaction changes the database and is committed,
the changes must never be lost because of any failure.
The atomicity property requires that we execute a transaction to completion. It is the
responsibility of the transaction recovery subsystem of a DBMS to ensure atomicity.
The preservation of consistency is generally considered to be the responsibility of the
programmers who write the database programs or of the DBMS module that enforces
integrity constraints.
The isolation property is enforced by the concurrency control subsystem of the DBMS.
If every transaction does not make its updates (write operations) visible to other
transactions until it is committed, one form of isolation is enforced that solves the
temporary update problem and eliminates cascading rollbacks

Durability is the responsibility of recovery subsystem.
