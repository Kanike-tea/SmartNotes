27.7 Web Search and Analysis

Web-based applications and services (such as click-through monitoring,
eyeball tracking, explicit or implicit user profile learning, and dynamic ser-
vice composition using Web APIs) are used for service adaptation and per-
sonalization. A personalization engine typically has algorithms that make
use of the user’s personalization information—collected by various tools—
to generate user-specific search results. The Web has become a rich land-
scape where people leave traces as they navigate, click, like, comment, and
buy things in this virtual space. This information is of high commercial
value, and many companies in all kinds of consumer goods mine and sell
this information for customer targeting.

= Finding information of social value. With more than 1 billion downloads
of the Facebook app on various Android devices, one can imagine how pop-
ular the various social networks have become in recent times. People build
what is called social capital in these virtual worlds such as Twitter and Face-
book. Social capital refers to features of social organizations, such as net-
works, norms, and social trust, that facilitate coordination and cooperation
for mutual benefit. Social scientists are studying social capital and how to
harness this rich resource to benefit society in various ways. We briefly
touch upon aspects of social search in Section 27.8.2.

Web analysis can be further classified into three categories: Web structure analysis,
which discovers knowledge from hyperlinks that represent the structure of the Web;
Web content analysis, which deals with extracting useful information/knowledge
from Web page contents; and Web usage analysis, which mines user access patterns
from usage logs that record the activity of every user.

27.7.2 Web Structure Analysis

The World Wide Web is a huge corpus of information, but locating resources that
are both high quality and relevant to the needs of the user is very difficult. The set of
Web pages taken as a whole has almost no unifying structure, with variability in
authoring style and content; this variability makes it difficult to precisely locate
needed information. Index-based search engines have been one of the primary
tools by which users search for information on the Web. Web search engines crawl
the Web and create an index to the Web for searching purposes. When a user spec-
ifies her need for information by supplying keywords, these Web search engines
query their repository of indexes and produce links or URLs with abbreviated con-
tent as search results. There may be thousands of pages relevant to a particular
query. A problem arises when only a few most relevant results are returned to the
user. Our discussions of querying and relevance-based ranking in IR systems in (see
Sections 27.2 and 27.3) is applicable to Web search engines. These ranking algo-
rithms explore the link structure of the Web.

Web pages, unlike standard text collections, contain connections to other Web
pages or documents (via the use of hyperlinks), allowing users to browse from page
to page. A hyperlink has two components: a destination page and an anchor text
that describes the link. For example, a person can link to the Yahoo Web site on her
