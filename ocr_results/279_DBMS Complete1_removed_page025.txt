LECTURE-8: Conversion of ER-Diagram to Relational Database

Conversion of Entity Sets:

1.

For each strong entity type E in the ER diagram, we create a relation R containing all the
single attributes of E. The primary key of the relation R will be one of the key attribute of R.

STUDENT(rollno (primary key) name, address)
FACULTY (id(primary key) ,name ,address, salary)
COURSE (course-id,(primary key) course_name,duration)
DEPARTMENT (dno(primary key),dname)

. For each weak entity type W in the ER diagram, we create another relation R that contains

all simple attributes of W. If E is an owner entity of W then key attribute of E is also include
In R. This key attribute of R is set as a foreign key attribute of R. Now the combination of
primary key attribute of owner entity type and partial key of the weak entity type will form
the key of the weak entity type

GUARDIAN((rollno name) (primary key) ,address,relationship)

Conversion of Relationship Sets:

Binary Relationships:

One-to-One Relationship:

For each 1:1 relationship type R in the ER-diagram involving two entities El and E2 we
choose one of entities(say El) preferably with total participation and add primary key
attribute of another E as a foreign key attribute in the table of entity(E1). We will also include
all the simple attributes of relationship type R in El if any, For example, the department
relationship has been extended tp include head-id and attribute of the relationship.
DEPARTMENT(D_NO,D_NAME,HEAD_ID,DATE_FROM)

One-to-Many Relationship:

For each 1:N relationship type R involving two entities El and E2, we identify the entity type
(say E1) at the N-side of the relationship type R and include primary key of the entity on the
other side of the relation (say E2) as a foreign key attribute in the table of E1. We include all
simple attribute (or simple components of a composite attribute of R (if any) in the table E1)

For example:

The works in relationship between the DEPARTMENT and FACULTY. For this relationship
choose the entity at N side, ie, FACULTY and add primary key attribute of another entity
DEPARTMENT i.e., DNO as a foreign key attribute in FACULTY.

FACULTY(CONTAINS WORKS_IN RELATIOSHIP)
(ID, NAME, ADDRESS, BASIC_SAL, DNO)

Many-to-Many Relationship:

For each M:N relationship type R, we create a new table (say S) to represent R, we also
include the primary key attributes of both the participating entity types as a foreign key
attribute in S. Any simple attributes of the M:N relationship type (or simple components as a
composite attribute) is also included as attributes of S.
