Transposing a Matrix: To transpose a matrix we must interchange the rows and columns.
This means that each element a[i][j] in the original matrix becomes element b[j][i] in the
transposematrix.

The algorithm finds all the elements in column 0 and store them in row 0 of the transpose matrix, find
all the elements in column | and store them in row 1, etc." Since the original matrix was ordered by
rows and the columns were ordered within each row. The transpose matrix will also be arranged in
ascending order. The variable, currentb, holds the position in b that will contain the next transposed
term. The terms in b is generated by rows by collecting the nonzero terms from column i of a

The transpose b of the sparse matrix a of figure 1.4b is shown in figure 1.5

Row Col value

[0] 6 6 68
[1] 0 0 15
[2] 0 4 91
[3] 1 1 ll
[4] 2 1 3
[5] 2 5 28
[6] 3 0 22
[7] 3 2 6
[8] 5 0 -15

Function to find the transpose of a sparse matrix

void transpose(term a[], term b[]) /* b is set to the transpose of a */
{

int n,ij, currentb;

n=a(0].value; /* total number of elements */

b[0].row = a[0].col; /* rows in b = columns in a */

b[O] .col = a[0] .row; /* columns in b = rows in a */

b[0].value = n;
