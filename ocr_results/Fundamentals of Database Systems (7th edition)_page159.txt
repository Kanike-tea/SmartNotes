4.7 Data Abstraction, Knowledge Representation, and Ontology Concepts 129

data modeling but also in artificial intelligence literature when discussing
knowledge representation (KR). This section discusses the similarities and differ-
ences between conceptual modeling and knowledge representation, and introduces
some of the alternative terminology and a few additional concepts.

The goal of KR techniques is to develop concepts for accurately modeling some domain
of knowledge by creating an ontology’” that describes the concepts of the domain
and how these concepts are interrelated. The ontology is used to store and manipu-
late knowledge for drawing inferences, making decisions, or answering questions.
The goals of KR are similar to those of semantic data models, but there are some
important similarities and differences between the two disciplines:

= Both disciplines use an abstraction process to identify common properties and
important aspects of objects in the miniworld (also known as domain of discourse
in KR) while suppressing insignificant differences and unimportant details.

= Both disciplines provide concepts, relationships, constraints, operations,
and languages for defining data and representing knowledge.

= KR is generally broader in scope than semantic data models. Different forms
of knowledge, such as rules (used in inference, deduction, and search),
incomplete and default knowledge, and temporal and spatial knowledge, are
represented in KR schemes. Database models are being expanded to include
some of these concepts (see Chapter 26).

= KR schemes include reasoning mechanisms that deduce additional facts
from the facts stored in a database. Hence, whereas most current database
systems are limited to answering direct queries, knowledge-based systems
using KR schemes can answer queries that involve inferences over the
stored data. Database technology is being extended with inference mecha-
nisms (see Section 26.5).

= Whereas most data models concentrate on the representation of database
schemas, or meta-knowledge, KR schemes often mix up the schemas with
the instances themselves in order to provide flexibility in representing
exceptions. This often results in inefficiencies when these KR schemes are
implemented, especially when compared with databases and when a large
amount of structured data (facts) needs to be stored.

We now discuss four abstraction concepts that are used in semantic data models,
such as the EER model, as well as in KR schemes: (1) classification and instantia-
tion, (2) identification, (3) specialization and generalization, and (4) aggregation
and association. The paired concepts of classification and instantiation are inverses
of one another, as are generalization and specialization. The concepts of aggrega-
tion and association are also related. We discuss these abstract concepts and their
relation to the concrete representations used in the EER model to clarify the data
abstraction process and to improve our understanding of the related process of
conceptual schema design. We close the section with a brief discussion of ontology,
which is being used widely in recent knowledge representation research.

'2,n ontology is somewhat similar to a conceptual schema, but with more knowledge, rules, and exceptions.
