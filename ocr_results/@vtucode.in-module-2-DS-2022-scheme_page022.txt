2, Adding Polynomials
To add two polynomials, examine their terms starting at the nodes pointed to by a and b.

elf the exponents of the two terms are equal, then add the two coefficients and create a new
term for the result, and also move the pointers to the next nodes in a and b.

elf the exponent of the current term in a is less than the exponent of the current term inb,
then create a duplicate term of b, attach this term to the result, called c, and advance the
pointer to the next term in b.

elf the exponent of the current term in b is less than the exponent of the current term ina,
then create a duplicate term of a, attach this term to the result, called c, and advance the
pointer to the next term ina

Below figure illustrates this process for the polynomials addition.
