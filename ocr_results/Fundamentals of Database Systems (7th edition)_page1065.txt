27.3 Types of Queries in IR Systems

The development of a sophisticated semantic system requires complex knowledge
bases of semantic information as well as retrieval heuristics. These systems often
require techniques from artificial intelligence and expert systems. Knowledge bases
like Cyc!> and WordNet" have been developed for use in knowledge-based IR sys-
tems based on semantic models. The Cyc knowledge base, for example, is a repre-
sentation of a vast quantity of commonsense knowledge. It presently contains 15.94
million assertions, 498,271 atomic concepts, and 441,159 nonatomic derived con-
cepts for reasoning about the objects and events of everyday life. WordNet is an
extensive thesaurus (over 117,000 concepts) that is very popular and is used by
many systems and is under continuous development (see Section 27.4.3).

27.3 Types of Queries in IR Systems

Different keywords are associated with the document set during the process of
indexing. These keywords generally consist of words, phrases, and other character-
izations of documents such as date created, author names, and type of document.
They are used by an IR system to build an inverted index (see Section 27.5), which
is then consulted during the search. The queries formulated by users are compared
to the set of index keywords. Most IR systems also allow the use of Boolean and
other operators to build a complex query. The query language with these operators
enriches the expressiveness of a user’s information need.

27.3.1 Keyword Queries

Keyword-based queries are the simplest and most commonly used forms of IR que-
ries: the user just enters keyword combinations to retrieve documents. The query
keyword terms are implicitly connected by a logical AND operator. A query such as
“database concepts’ retrieves documents that contain both the words ‘database’ and
‘concepts’ at the top of the retrieved results. In addition, most systems also retrieve
documents that contain only ‘database’ or only ‘concepts’ in their text. Some sys-
tems remove most commonly occurring words (such as a, the, of, and so on, called
stopwords) as a preprocessing step before sending the filtered query keywords to
the IR engine. Most IR systems do not pay attention to the ordering of these words
in the query. All retrieval models provide support for keyword queries.

27.3.2 Boolean Queries

Some IR systems allow using the AND, OR, NOT, (), +, and — Boolean operators in
combinations of keyword formulations. AND requires that both terms be found.
OR lets either term be found. NOT means any record containing the second term
will be excluded. ‘( )’ means the Boolean operators can be nested using parentheses.
“+ is equivalent to AND, requiring the term; the ‘+’ should be placed directly in front
