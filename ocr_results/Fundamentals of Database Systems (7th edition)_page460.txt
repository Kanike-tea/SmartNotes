tags, and the individual table data elements in a row are displayed within
<TD> ... </TD> tags.”

= Some tags may have attributes, which appear within the start tag and
describe additional properties of the tag.*

In Figure 13.2, the <TABLE> start tag has four attributes describing various charac-
teristics of the table. The following <TD> and <FONT> start tags have one and two
attributes, respectively.

HTML has a very large number of predefined tags, and whole books are devoted to
describing how to use these tags. If designed properly, HTML documents can be
formatted so that humans are able to easily understand the document contents and
are able to navigate through the resulting Web documents. However, the source
HTML text documents are very difficult to interpret automatically by computer pro-
grams because they do not include schema information about the type of data in the
documents. As e-commerce and other Internet applications become increasingly
automated, it is becoming crucial to be able to exchange Web documents among
various computer sites and to interpret their contents automatically. This need was
one of the reasons that led to the development of XML. In addition, an extendible
version of HTML called XHTML was developed that allows users to extend the tags
of HTML for different applications and allows an XHTML file to be interpreted by
standard XML processing programs. Our discussion will focus on XML only.

The example in Figure 13.2 illustrates a static HTML page, since all the information
to be displayed is explicitly spelled out as fixed text in the HTML file. In many cases,
some of the information to be displayed may be extracted from a database. For
example, the project names and the employees working on each project may be
extracted from the database in Figure 5.6 through the appropriate SQL query. We
may want to use the same HTML formatting tags for displaying each project and the
employees who work on it, but we may want to change the particular projects (and
employees) being displayed. For example, we may want to see a Web page displaying
the information for ProjectX, and then later a page displaying the information for
ProjectY. Although both pages are displayed using the same HTML formatting tags,
the actual data items displayed will be different. Such Web pages are called dynamic,
since the data parts of the page may be different each time it is displayed, even though
the display appearance is the same. We discussed in Chapter 11 how scripting lan-
guages, such as PHP, can be used to generate dynamic Web pages.

13.2 XML Hierarchical (Tree) Data Model

We now introduce the data model used in XML. The basic object in XML is the XML
document. Two main structuring concepts are used to construct an XML document:
elements and attributes. It is important to note that the term attribute in XML is not

2<TR> stands for table row and <TD> stands for table data.

SThis is how the term attribute is used in document markup languages, which differs from how it is used
in database models.
