The second rotation type is called the double left-right rotation (LR-
rotation). It is, in fact, a combination of two rotations: we perform the L-rotation
of the left subtree of root r followed by the R-rotation of the new tree rooted at
r (Figure 6.5). It is performed after a new key is inserted into the right subtree of
the left child of a tree whose root had the balance of +1 before the insertion.
