Database Management System [BCS403]

Example: Trigger vs. Assertion

All new customers opening an account must have opening balance >= $100. However, once the
account is opened their balance can fall below that amount.

We need triggers, assertions cannot be used Trigger Event: Before Insert

Create Trigger OpeningBal

Before Insert On Customer

For Each Row

Begin
IF (:new. balance is null or :new.balance < 100) Then
RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20004, ‘Balance should be >= $100’);
End IF;

End;

1.3 Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL
1.3.1 Concept of a View in SQL

A view in SQL terminology is a single table that is derived from other tables. other tables can be
base tables or previously defined views. A view does not necessarily exist in physical form; it is
considered to be a virtual table, in contrast to base tables, whose tuples are always physically
stored in the database. This limits the possible update operations that can be applied to views, but
it does not provide any limitations on querying a view. We can think of a view as a way of specifying
a table that we need to reference frequently, even though it may not exist physically.

For example, referring to the COMPANY database, we may frequently issue queries that retrieve
the employee name and the project names that the employee works on. Rather than having to
specify the join of the three tables EMPLOYEE,WORKS_ON, and PROJECT every time we issue
this query, we can define a view that is specified as the result of these joins. Then we can issue
queries on the view, which are specified as single table retrievals rather than as retrievals involving
two joins on three tables. We call the EMPLOYEE,WORKS_ON, and PROJECT tables the defining
tables of the view.
