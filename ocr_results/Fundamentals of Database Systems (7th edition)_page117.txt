3.8 Example of Other Notation: UML Class Diagrams

Relationship types are called associations in UML terminology, and relationship
instances are called links. A binary association (binary relationship type) is repre-
sented as a line connecting the participating classes (entity types), and may option-
ally have a name. A relationship attribute, called a link attribute, is placed in a box
that is connected to the association’s line by a dashed line. The (min, max) notation
described in Section 3.7.4 is used to specify relationship constraints, which are
called multiplicities in UML terminology. Multiplicities are specified in the form
min..max, and an asterisk (*) indicates no maximum limit on participation. How-
ever, the multiplicities are placed on the opposite ends of the relationship when com-
pared with the (min, max) notation discussed in Section 3.7.4 (compare Fig-
ures 3.15 and 3.16). In UML, a single asterisk indicates a multiplicity of 0 ..*, anda
single 1 indicates a multiplicity of 1..1. A recursive relationship type (see Section 3.4.2)
is called a reflexive association in UML, and the role names—like the multiplicities—
are placed at the opposite ends of an association when compared with the placing of
role names in Figure 3.15.

In UML, there are two types of relationships: association and aggregation.
Aggregation is meant to represent a relationship between a whole object and its com-
ponent parts, and it has a distinct diagrammatic notation. In Figure 3.16, we modeled
the locations of a department and the single location of a project as aggregations.
However, aggregation and association do not have different structural properties, and
the choice as to which type of relationship to use—aggregation or association—is
somewhat subjective. In the ER model, both are represented as relationships.

UML also distinguishes between unidirectional and bidirectional associations
(or aggregations). In the unidirectional case, the line connecting the classes is dis-
played with an arrow to indicate that only one direction for accessing related
objects is needed. If no arrow is displayed, the bidirectional case is assumed, which
is the default. For example, if we always expect to access the manager of a depart-
ment starting from a DEPARTMENT object, we would draw the association line rep-
resenting the MANAGES association with an arrow from DEPARTMENT to
EMPLOYEE. In addition, relationship instances may be specified to be ordered.
For example, we could specify that the employee objects related to each depart-
ment through the WORKS_FOR association (relationship) should be ordered by
their Start_date attribute value. Association (relationship) names are optional in
UML, and relationship attributes are displayed in a box attached with a dashed
line to the line representing the association/aggregation (see Start_date and Hours
in Figure 3.16).

The operations given in each class are derived from the functional requirements of
the application, as we discussed in Section 3.1. It is generally sufficient to specify the
operation names initially for the logical operations that are expected to be applied
to individual objects of a class, as shown in Figure 3.16. As the design is refined,
more details are added, such as the exact argument types (parameters) for each
operation, plus a functional description of each operation. UML has function
descriptions and sequence diagrams to specify some of the operation details, but
these are beyond the scope of our discussion.
