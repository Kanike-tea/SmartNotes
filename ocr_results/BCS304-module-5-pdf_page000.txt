5.0 Hashing

Hashing enables us to perform the dictionary operations such as search, insert and deleting
expected time.

In a mathematical sense, a map is a relation between two sets. We can define Map M as a set of
pairs, where each pair is of the form (key, value), where for given a key, we can find a value using
some kind of a “function” that maps keys to values.

The key for a given object can be calculated using a function called a hash function.

Hashing technique is designed to use a special function called the hash function which is used to

map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements.

5.0.1 Hash Function

Is a function which is used to put the data in hash table. The integer is returned by the hash function
is called hash key.
A good hash function should satisfy 2 criteria
1. A hash function should hash address such that keys are distributed as evenly as possible
among the various cells of the hash table.

2. Computation of key should be simple.

5.0.2 Hash Table

Hash table is a data structure used for storing and retrieving data very quickly.

Insertion, Deletion or Retrieval operation takes place with help of hash value.

Hence every entry in the hash table is associated with some key.

Using the hash key the required piece of data can be searched in the hash table by few or more key

comparisons. The searching time is dependent upon the size of the hash table.
