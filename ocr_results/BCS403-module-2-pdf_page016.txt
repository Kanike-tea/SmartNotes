Database Management System [BCS403]

The SELECT operator is unary; that is, it is applied to a single relation. The degree of the relation
resulting from a SELECT operation is the same as the degree of R.The number of tuples in the
resulting relation is always less than or equal to the number of tuples in R. That is,
|oc (R)| <|R| for any condition C
The fraction of tuples selected by a selection condition is referred to as the selectivity of the
condition.
The SELECT operation is commutative; that is,
6<cond1>(G<cond2>(R)) = 6<cond2>(G<condi>(R))

Hence, a sequence of SELECTs can be applied in any order.we can always combine a cascade (or
sequence) of SELECT operations into a single SELECT operation, with a conjunctive (AND)
condition; that is,

G<condi>(6<cond2>(...(G<condn>(R)) «.-)) = 6<conai> AND<cona2> AND +» AND <conan>(R)
In SQL, the SELECT condition is specified in the WHERE clause of a query.For example, the
following operation:

6pno=4 AND Salary>25000 (EMPLOYEE)
would to the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno=4 AND Salary>25000;

2.2.2 The PROJECT Operation

The PROJECT operation denoted by z (pi) selects certain columns from the table and discards the
other columns, Used when we are interested in only certain attributes of a relation. The result of the
PROJECT operation can be visualized as a vertical partition of the relation into two relations:
- one has the needed columns (attributes) and contains the result of the operation
- the other contains the discarded columns
The general form.of the PROJECT operation is
Ti<attribute list>(R)
where
1 (pi) - symbol used to represent the PROJECT operation,
<attributelist> - desired sublist of attributes from the attributes of relation R.
The result of the PROJECT operation has only the attributes specified in <attribute list> in the same
order as they appear in the list. Hence, its degree is equal to the number of attributes in <attribute

list>
