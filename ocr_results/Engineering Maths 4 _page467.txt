Probability p;; is associated with every pair of states *( 4;
immediately after a; occurs. Such a stochastic process's called a finite Markov Chain.
p;;8 are called transition probabilities and P = (pj) 38: called the transition
probability matrix (t+ p+ ni) Bee weg OE

is called the unique fixed probability

The probability that the system changes from the state a; to a in exactly n steps is*
denoted by ps ae The matrix formed by the probabilities 3 : is called the n step
