the database states. Hence, the DDL includes provisions for specifying the various
types of constraints so that the DBMS can automatically enforce them. In SQL, the
CREATE TABLE statement of the SQL DDL allows the definition of primary key,
unique key, NOT NULL, entity integrity, and referential integrity constraints, among
other constraints (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2) .

5.2.5 Other Types of Constraints

The preceding integrity constraints are included in the data definition language
because they occur in most database applications. Another class of general con-
straints, sometimes called semantic integrity constraints, are not part of the DDL
and have to be specified and enforced in a different way. Examples of such con-
straints are the salary of an employee should not exceed the salary of the employee’s
supervisor and the maximum number of hours an employee can work on all projects
per week is 56. Such constraints can be specified and enforced within the applica-
tion programs that update the database, or by using a general-purpose constraint
specification language. Mechanisms called triggers and assertions can be used in
SQL, through the CREATE ASSERTION and CREATE TRIGGER statements, to specify
some of these constraints (see Chapter 7). It is more common to check for these
types of constraints within the application programs than to use constraint specifi-
cation languages because the latter are sometimes difficult and complex to use, as
we discuss in Section 26.1.

The types of constraints we discussed so far may be called state constraints
because they define the constraints that a valid state of the database must satisfy.
Another type of constraint, called transition constraints, can be defined to deal
with state changes in the database.'! An example of a transition constraint is: “the
salary of an employee can only increase.” Such constraints are typically enforced
by the application programs or specified using active rules and triggers, as we dis-
cuss in Section 26.1.

and Dealing with Constraint Violations

The operations of the relational model can be categorized into retrievals and
updates. The relational algebra operations, which can be used to specify retrievals,
are discussed in detail in Chapter 8. A relational algebra expression forms a new
relation after applying a number of algebraic operators to an existing set of rela-
tions; its main use is for querying a database to retrieve information. The user for-
mulates a query that specifies the data of interest, and a new relation is formed by
applying relational operators to retrieve this data. The result relation becomes the
answer to (or result of) the user’s query. Chapter 8 also introduces the language

‘State constraints are sometimes called static constraints, and transition constraints are sometimes
called dynamic constraints.
