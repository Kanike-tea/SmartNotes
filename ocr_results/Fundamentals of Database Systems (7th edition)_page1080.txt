Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

Web page with anchor text such as “My favorite Web site.” Anchor texts can be
thought of as being implicit endorsements. They provide important latent human
annotation. A person linking to other Web pages from her Web page is assumed to
have some relation to those Web pages. Web search engines aim to distill results
per their relevance and authority. There are many redundant hyperlinks, like the
links to the homepage on every Web page of the Web site. Such hyperlinks must be
eliminated from the search results by the search engines.

A hub is a Web page or a Web site that links to a collection of prominent sites
(authorities) on a common topic. A good authority is a page that is pointed to by
many good hubs, whereas a good hub is a page that points to many good authori-
ties. These ideas are used by the HITS ranking algorithm. We briefly discuss a cou-
ple of ranking algorithms in the next section.

27.7.3 Analyzing the Link Structure of Web Pages

The goal of Web structure analysis is to generate a structural representation about
the Web site and Web pages. Web structure analysis focuses on the inner structure
of documents and deals with the link structure using hyperlinks at the interdocu-
ment level. The structure and content of Web pages are often combined for infor-
mation retrieval by Web search engines. Given a collection of interconnected Web
documents, interesting and informative facts describing their connectivity in the
Web subset can be discovered. Web structure analysis is also used to help with nav-
igation and make it possible to compare/integrate different Web page schemes.
This aspect of Web structure analysis facilitates Web document classification and
clustering on the basis of structure.

The PageRank Ranking Algorithm. As discussed earlier, ranking algorithms
are used to order search results based on relevance and authority. Google uses the
well-known PageRank algorithm,”* which is based on the “importance” of each
page. Every Web page has a number of forward links (out-edges) and backlinks (in-
edges). It is very difficult to determine all the backlinks of a Web page, whereas it is
relatively straightforward to determine its forward links. According to the PageRank
algorithm, highly linked pages are more important (have greater authority) than
pages with fewer links. However, not all backlinks are important. A backlink to a
page from a credible source is more important than a link from some arbitrary
page. Thus a page has a high rank if the sum of the ranks of its backlinks is high.
PageRank was an attempt to see how good an approximation of the “importance”
of a page can be obtained from the link structure.

The computation of page ranking follows an iterative approach. PageRank of a Web
page is calculated as a sum of the PageRanks of all its backlinks. PageRank treats the
Web like a Markov model. An imaginary Web surfer visits an infinite string of pages by
clicking randomly. The PageRank of a page is an estimate of how often the surfer winds

Google. For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ PageRank
