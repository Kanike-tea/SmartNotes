An artificial kidney is a device that is being developed to mimic the functions of the human
kidney. The goal of an artificial kidney is to provide a more effective and efficient means of treating
patients with chronic kidney disease, who currently rely on dialysis or kidney transplantation.

There are currently two main approaches to developing an artificial kidney: a biological
approach and a technological approach.

The biological approach involves using living cells, such as kidney cells or stem cells, to
create a functional, implantable artificial kidney.

The technological approach involves using synthetic materials, such as silicon or
polymer, to create a dialysis device that can filter the blood and remove waste and excess fluids.

It's important to note that while the development of an artificial kidney holds great promise,
it is not a cure for chronic kidney disease and patients with kidney failure will still need dialysis or
kidney transplantation in the meantime.
