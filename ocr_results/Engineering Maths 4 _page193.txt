¢ Line integral of a complex valued function

Let f(z) = u(x,y) +iv(x,y) bea complex valued function defined over a region
R and C beacurve in the region. Then .

J f(z) de = J (usivy (ax + idy)

This shows that the evaluation of a line integral of a complex valued functionis nothing
but the evaluation of line integrals of real valued functions,
