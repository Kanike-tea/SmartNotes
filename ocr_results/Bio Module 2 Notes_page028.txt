3. Benefits of Enzymes in Food Processing

e Enhance flavor, texture, and appearance

e Increase efficiency and yield

e Reduce processing time & costs

e Improve nutritional value (e.g., lactose-free products)

e Eco-friendly (reduces chemical use in food production)

4. Challenges

e Sensitive to temperature and pH
e High production cost for some enzymes

¢ Potential allergenicity (e.g., proteases in bakery)

Application of Enzymes in Detergent Industry

Enzymes find use as functional ingredients in detergents and contribute to cleaning of laundry
and dishes in an efficient, environmentally mild, and energy-saving manner. Proteases, lipases,
amylases are the major class of detergent enzymes, each provides specific benefits for

application in laundry and automatic dishwashing. Proteases are the first to be used extensively
