26.6 Summary

First in Section 26.1 we introduced the topic of active databases, which provide addi-
tional functionality for specifying active rules. We introduced the event-condition-
action (ECA) model for active databases. The rules can be automatically triggered by
events that occur—such as a database update—and they can initiate certain actions
that have been specified in the rule declaration if certain conditions are true. Many
commercial packages have some of the functionality provided by active databases in
the form of triggers. We gave examples of row-level triggers in the Oracle commercial
system in Section 26.1.1. We discussed the different options for specifying triggers in
Section 26.1.2, such as row-level versus statement-level, before versus after, and
immediate versus deferred. Then in Section 26.1.3 we gave examples of statement-
level rules in the STARBURST experimental system. We briefly discussed some
design issues and some possible applications for active databases in Section 26.1.4.
The syntax for triggers in the SQL-99 standard was also discussed in Section 26.1.5.

Next in Section 26.2 we introduced some of the concepts of temporal databases,
which permit the database system to store a history of changes and allow users to
query both current and past states of the database. In Section 26.2.1, we discussed
how time is represented and distinguished between the valid time and transaction
time dimensions. In Section 26.2.2 we discussed how valid time, transaction time,
and bitemporal relations can be implemented using tuple versioning in the rela-
tional model, and we provided examples to illustrate how updates, inserts, and
deletes are implemented. We also showed how complex objects can be used to
implement temporal databases using attribute versioning in Section 26.2.3. We
looked at some of the querying operations for temporal relational databases and
gave a brief introduction to the TSQL2 language in Section 26.2.4.

Then we turned to spatial databases in Section 26.3. Spatial databases provide
concepts for databases that keep track of objects that have spatial characteristics.
We gave an introduction to spatial databases in Section 26.3.1. We discussed the
types of spatial data and spatial data models in Section 26.3.2, then the types of
operators for processing spatial data and the types of spatial queries in Sec-
tion 26.3.3. In Section 26.3.4, we gave an overview of spatial indexing techniques,
including the popular R-trees. Then we introduced some spatial data mining
techniques in Section 26.3.5, and discussed some applications that require spatial
databases in Section 26.3.6.

In Section 26.4 we discussed some basic types of multimedia databases and their
important characteristics. Multimedia databases provide features that allow users
to store and query different types of multimedia information, which includes
images (such as pictures and drawings), video clips (such as movies, newsreels, and
home videos), audio clips (such as songs, phone messages, and speeches), and doc-
uments (such as books and articles). We provided a brief overview of the various
types of media sources and how multimedia sources may be indexed. Images are an
extremely common type of data among databases today and are likely to occupy a
large proportion of stored data in databases. We therefore provided a more detailed
treatment of images: their automatic analysis (Section 26.4.1), recognition of objects
within images (Section 26.4.2), and their semantic tagging (Section 26.1.3)—all of
which contribute to developing better systems to retrieve images by content, which
