Introduction:
Sampling is a statistical method of obtaining representative data (observations) from a group. We have
been using sampling concepts in our day to day lives knowingly or unknowingly; for instance we take a
handful of rice to check the rice quality of the full lot. This is an example of random sampling from a large
population.

Population (Universe):
The group of objects (individuals) under. study,
is called population or universe. Universe may be finite “Ny

or infinite.
Sample: C)
A part containing objects(individuals), selected from oe Sample

the population is called a sample. Population

Sample size:
The number of individuals in a sample is called a sample size. If the sample size n is less than or equal to 30, then
the sample is aid to be small, otherwise it is called a large sample.
Population and Sample

Population

Random Sampling:
The selection of objects (individuals) from the universe in such a way that each object (individual) of the
universe has the same chance of being selected is called random sampling. Lottery system is the most common
example of random sampling.
Every random sampling need not be simple. For example, if balls are drawn without replacement from
a bag of balls containing different balls; the probability of success changes in every trial. Thus, the sampling
though random is not simple.
