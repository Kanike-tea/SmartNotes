5. Aids in Reproduction: A cell aids in reproduction through the processes called
mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is termed as the asexual reproduction where the parent
cell divides to form daughter cells. Meiosis causes the daughter cells to be

genetically different from the parent cells.

4. What are stem cells? Explain the classification and application of stem cells

Ans. Stem cells also have the ability to repair damaged cells. These cells have strong healing

power. They can evolve into any type of cell.

Research on stem cells is going on, and it is believed that stem cell therapies can cure ailments

like paralysis and Alzheimer’s as well.
Types of cells
Stem cells are of the following different types:

e Embryonic Stem Cells
e Adult Stem Cells
e Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

¢ Mesenchymal stem cells

1. Embryonic Stem Cells:
The fertilized egg begins to divide immediately. All the cells in the young embryo are
totipotent cells. These cells form a hollow structure within a few days. Cells in one region
group together to form the inner cell mass. This contains pluripotent cells that make up the

developing foetus.
The embryonic stem cells can be further classified as:

a. Totipotent Stem Cells: These can differentiate into all possible types of stem cells.

b. Pluripotent Stem Cells: These are the cells from an early embryo and can differentiate into

any cell type.

c. Multipotent Stem Cells: These differentiate into a closely related cell type. E.g., the

hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into red blood cells and white blood cells.
