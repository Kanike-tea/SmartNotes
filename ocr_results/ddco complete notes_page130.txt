«The control-signals that govern a particular transfer are asserted at the

start of theclock cycle.
Input & Output Gating for one Register Bit
Implementation for one bit of register Ri(as shown in fig 7.3)
= All operations and data transfers are controlled by the processor clock.

eA 2-input multiplexer is used to select the data applied to the input
of an edge-triggered D flip-flop.

¢ Riin=1,Multiplexer selects data on the bus. This data will be loaded into
flip-flop at rising-edgeof clock.

¢ Riin=0,Multiplexer feeds back the value currently stored in the flipflop
¢ Q output of flip-flop is connected to bus via a tri-state gate.
« When Riout=0, gates output in the high-impedance state.
« When Riout=1,gate drives the bus to 0 or 1,depending on the value

of Q.

PERFORMING AN ARITHMETIC OR LOGIC OPERATION(refer fig:7.2)
e The ALU is a combinational circuit that has no internal storage.
«The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations on the 2 operands
applied to its A and Binputs.
«ALU gets the two operands, one is from MUX and another from bus. The
result is temporarily stored in register Z.
¢ Therefore, a sequence of operations [R3]=[R1]+[R2].
1) Rlout, Yin
2) R2out, Select Y, Add, Zin
3) Zout, R3in
Instruction execution proceeds as follows:
Step 1 --> Contents from register R1 are loaded into register Y.
Step2 --> Contents from Y and from register R2 are applied to the A and
B inputs of ALU; Addition is performed & Result is stored in the Z register.
Step 3 --> The contents of Z register is stored in the R3 register.
¢ The signals are activated for the duration of the clock cycle
corresponding to thatstep. All other signals are inactive.
FETCHING A WORD FROM MEMORY
« To fetch instruction/data from memory, the processor has to specify
the address of the memory location where this information is
stored and request a Read operation.
¢ processor transfers required address to MAR.At the same time, processor
issues Read signal on control-lines of memory-bus.
¢ When requested-data are received from memory, they are stored in MDR.
From MDR, they are transferred to other registers in the processor.
The Connections for register MDR has shown in fig 7.4
