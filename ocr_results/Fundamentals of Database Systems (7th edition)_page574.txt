Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures

Flash memories are high-density, high-performance memories using EEPROM
(electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) technology. The advantage
of flash memory is the fast access speed; the disadvantage is that an entire block
must be erased and written over simultaneously. Flash memories come in two types
called NAND and NOR flash based on the type of logic circuits used. The NAND
flash devices have a higher storage capacity for a given cost and are used as the data
storage medium in appliances with capacities ranging from 8 GB to 64 GB for the
popular cards that cost less than a dollar per GB. Flash devices are used in cameras,
MP3/MP4 players, cell phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), and so on. USB
(universal serial bus) flash drives or USB sticks have become the most portable
medium for carrying data between personal computers; they have a flash memory

storage device integrated with a USB interface.

Optical Drives. The most popular form of optical removable storage is CDs (com-
pact disks) and DVDs. CDs have a 700-MB capacity whereas DVDs have capacities
ranging from 4.5 to 15 GB. CD-ROM(compact disk - read only memory) disks
store data optically and are read by a laser. CD-ROMs contain prerecorded data
that cannot be overwritten. The version of compact and digital video disks called
CD-R (compact disk recordable) and DVD-R or DVD+R, which are also known as
WORM (write-once-read-many) disks, are a form of optical storage used for
archiving data; they allow data to be written once and read any number of times
without the possibility of erasing. They hold about half a gigabyte of data per disk
and last much longer than magnetic disks.* A higher capacity format for DVDs
called Blu-ray DVD can store 27 GB per layer, or 54 GB in a two-layer disk. Optical
jukebox memories use an array of CD-ROM platters, which are loaded onto drives
on demand. Although optical jukeboxes have capacities in the hundreds of giga-
bytes, their retrieval times are in the hundreds of milliseconds, quite a bit slower
than magnetic disks. This type of tertiary storage is continuing to decline because
of the rapid decrease in cost and the increase in capacities of magnetic disks. Most
personal computer disk drives now read CD-ROM and DVD disks. Typically,
drives are CD-R (compact disk recordable) that can create CD-ROMs and audio

CDs, as well as record on DVDs.

Magnetic Tapes. Finally, magnetic tapes are used for archiving and backup stor-
age of data. Tape jukeboxes—which contain a bank of tapes that are catalogued
and can be automatically loaded onto tape drives—are becoming popular as tertiary
storage to hold terabytes of data. For example, NASA’s EOS (Earth Observation

Satellite) system stores archived databases in this fashion.

Many large organizations are using terabyte-sized databases. The term very large
database can no longer be precisely defined because disk storage capacities are on

3Their rotational speeds are lower (around 400 rpm), giving higher latency delays and low transfer
rates (around 100 to 200 KB/second) for a 1X drive. nX drives (e.g, 16X (n = 16) are supposed to
give n times higher transfer rate by multiplying the rpm n times. The 1X DVD transfer rate is about

1.385 MB/s.
