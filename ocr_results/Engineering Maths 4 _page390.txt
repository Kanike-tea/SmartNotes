©. Errors ”

In a test process there can be four possible situations of which two of the situations

_ leads to the two types of errors and the same is presented as follows.

: Accepting the hypothesis ° Rejecting the hypothesis
Hypotheéis Correct decision Wrong decision
~ ‘true - ; (Type I error)
Hypothesis Wrong decision - Correct decision

| false 1 (Type Il error), |

&h order to minimize both these types of errors we need to increase the sample size. It
is further important to note that

acceptance or non acceptarice of a hypothesis is purely
based on the information revealed by the sample and what is indicated by a particular
sample may not always be true in respect of the population.

rejection of null hypothesis is called ‘critical region or

e ‘Significance level

The probability level, below which leads to the
the significance level. This probability is conve
1%. These are called significance levels,’ . °

tejection of the hypothesis is known as
ntionally fixed at 0.05 or 0.01 i.e. 5% or

i level of significance than at 5% level
of significance. 5% level of significance can also be understood as, the probability of
comunitting errors of either types, (Type I or Type Il) is 0.05.
“@ Tests of significance and Confidence intervals
The process which helps us to decide about the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis
is called the test of significance, ie * se hanger k : ;
Let us suppose that we have anormal population with mean and S.D o. Ifx is the
sample mean ‘of a random sample of size n the quantity z defined by
x Z

is called the Standard Normal Variate ( S.N.V).
