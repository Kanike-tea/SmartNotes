S = ABCD + ABD + BC

Solve S=F(A,B,C,D)=Zm(6,7,9,10,13)+d(1,4,5,11) using K map to get minimum SOP
expression.

NAND AND NOR IMPLEMENTATION

Digital circuits are frequently constructed with NAND or NOR gates rather than
with AND and OR gates.

NAND and NOR gates are easier to fabricate with electronic components and are
the basic gates used in all IC digital logic families.

The NAND gate is said to be a universal gate because any logic circuit can be
implemented with it. To show that any Boolean function can be implemented with
NAND gates, we need only show that the logical operations of AND, OR, and
complement can be obtained with NAND gates alone. This is indeed shown in Fig.
3.16.

The complement operation is obtained from a one-input NAND gate that behaves
exactly like an inverter. The AND operation requires two NAND gates. The first
produces the NAND operation and the second inverts the logical sense of the
signal. The OR operation is achieved through a NAND gate with additional
inverters in each input.

A convenient way to implement a Boolean function with NAND gates is to obtain
the simplified Boolean function in terms of Boolean operators and then convert
the function to NAND logic.

The conversion of an algebraic expression from AND, OR, and complement to
NAND can be done by simple circuit manipulation techniques that change AND-
OR diagrams to NAND diagrams.

Two equivalent graphic symbols for the NAND gate are shown in Fig. 3.17. The
AND-invert symbol has been defined previously and consists
