Chapter 30 Database Security

30.1.4 Access Control, User Accounts, and Database Audits

Whenever a person or a group of persons needs to access a database system, the
individual or group must first apply for a user account. The DBA will then create a
new account number and password for the user if there is a legitimate need to
access the database. The user must log in to the DBMS by entering the account
number and password whenever database access is needed. The DBMS checks that
the account number and password are valid; if they are, the user is permitted to use
the DBMS and to access the database. Application programs can also be considered
users and are required to log in to the database (see Chapter 10).

It is straightforward to keep track of database users and their accounts and pass-
words by creating an encrypted table or file with two fields: AccountNumber and
Password. This table can easily be maintained by the DBMS. Whenever a new
account is created, a new record is inserted into the table. When an account is can-
celed, the corresponding record must be deleted from the table.

The database system must also keep track of all operations on the database that are
applied by a certain user throughout each login session, which consists of the
sequence of database interactions that a user performs from the time of logging in
to the time of logging off. When a user logs in, the DBMS can record the user’s
account number and associate it with the computer or device from which the user
logged in. All operations applied from that computer or device are attributed to the
user’s account until the user logs off. It is particularly important to keep track of
update operations that are applied to the database so that, if the database is tam-
pered with, the DBA can determine which user did the tampering.

To keep a record of all updates applied to the database and of particular users who
applied each update, we can modify the system log. Recall from Chapters 20 and 22
that the system log includes an entry for each operation applied to the database that
may be required for recovery from a transaction failure or system crash. We can
expand the log entries so that they also include the account number of the user and
the online computer or device ID that applied each operation recorded in the log. If
any tampering with the database is suspected, a database audit is performed, which
consists of reviewing the log to examine all accesses and operations applied to the
database during a certain time period. When an illegal or unauthorized operation is
found, the DBA can determine the account number used to perform the operation.
Database audits are particularly important for sensitive databases that are updated
by many transactions and users, such as a banking database that can be updated by
thousands of bank tellers. A database log that is used mainly for security purposes
serves as an audit trail.

30.1.5 Sensitive Data and Types of Disclosures

Sensitivity of data is a measure of the importance assigned to the data by its
owner for the purpose of denoting its need for protection. Some databases con-
tain only sensitive data whereas other databases may contain no sensitive data at
all. Handling databases that fall at these two extremes is relatively easy because
