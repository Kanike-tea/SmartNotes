¢ Cells provide structure and support to the body of an organism.

e The cell interior is organized into different individual organelles surrounded by a

separate membrane.

e The nucleus (major organelle) holds genetic information necessary for reproduction

and cell growth.
e Every cell has one nucleus and membrane-bound organelles in the cytoplasm.

e Mitochondria, a double membrane-bound organelle is mainly responsible for the

energy transactions vital for the survival of the cell.
« Lysosomes digest unwanted materials in the cell.

e Endoplasmic reticulum plays a significant role in the internal organization of the cell
by synthesizing selective molecules and processing, directing and sorting them to

their appropriate locations.

Structure of a Cell
Understanding cell structure and functions is key to understanding life processes.
Structure:
1. Plasma Membrane: Surrounds the cell, regulating the passage of substances.
2.Cytoplasm: Jelly-like substance filling the cell, containing organelles.
3. Nucleus: Houses genetic material (DNA), controlling cell activities.
4. Organelles: Specialized structures:

a. Endoplasmic Reticulum: Involved in protein and lipid metabolism.

b. Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, sorts, and packages molecules.

c. Mitochondria: Generates energy through respiration.

d. Lysosomes: Break down waste materials.

e. Ribosomes: Sites of protein synthesis.

f. Centrioles (in animals): Assist in cell division.

g. Cytoskeleton: Provides structural support and aids in cell movement.
