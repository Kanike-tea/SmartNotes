2.5.1 Chromatic Polynomials

A number of different colours, let us take

ly colouring G with these A colours.
First, consider the null graph Ny, with n vertices. In this graph, no two vertices are adjaceni.

Therefore, a proper colouring of this graph can be done by ssigning a single colour to alte

vertices. Thus, if the number of different colours available is A, then each vertex of the grit

has A possible choices of colours assigned to it, and as such the graph can be properly colour
