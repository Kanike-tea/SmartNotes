viii Preface

we will describe them later in the preface when we discuss the organization of
the seventh edition.

The following are key features of the book:

= A self-contained, flexible organization that can be tailored to individual
needs; in particular, the chapters can be used in different orders depending
on the instructor’s preference.

= A companion website (http://www.pearsonhighered.com/cs-resources)
includes data to be loaded into various types of relational databases for more
realistic student laboratory exercises.

= A dependency chart (shown later in this preface) to show which chapters
depend on other earlier chapters; this can guide the instructor who wants to
tailor the order of presentation of the chapters.

= A collection of supplements, including a robust set of materials for instruc-
tors and students such as PowerPoint slides, figures from the text, and an
instructor’s guide with solutions.

Organization and Contents of the Seventh Edition

There are some organizational changes in the seventh edition as well as improve-
ment to the individual chapters. The book is now divided into 12 parts as follows:

= Part 1 (Chapters 1 and 2) describes the basic introductory concepts neces-
sary for a good understanding of database models, systems, and languages.
Chapters 1 and 2 introduce databases, typical users, and DBMS concepts,
terminology, and architecture, as well as a discussion of the progression of
database technologies over time and a brief history of data models. These
chapters have been updated to introduce some of the newer technologies
such as NOSQL systems.

= Part 2 (Chapters 3 and 4) includes the presentation on entity-relationship
modeling and database design; however, it is important to note that instruc-
tors can cover the relational model chapters (Chapters 5 through 8) before
Chapters 3 and 4 if that is their preferred order of presenting the course
materials. In Chapter 3, the concepts of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model
and ER diagrams are presented and used to illustrate conceptual database
design. Chapter 4 shows how the basic ER model can be extended to incorpo-
rate additional modeling concepts such as subclasses, specialization, gener-
alization, union types (categories) and inheritance, leading to the
enhanced-ER (EER) data model and EER diagrams. The notation for the class
diagrams of UML are also introduced in Chapters 7 and 8 as an alternative
model and diagrammatic notation for ER/EER diagrams.

= Part 3 (Chapters 5 through 8) includes a detailed presentation on relational
databases and SQL with some additional new material in the SQL chapters
to cover a few SQL constructs that were not in the previous edition. Chapter 5
