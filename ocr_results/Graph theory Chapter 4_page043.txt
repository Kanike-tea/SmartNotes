We note that the degree.of every Vertex in Vy is greater than or equal to 2. Also, the
degree of every vertex In V2 is less than’ or equal to 2. Hence, by Theorem 2, there exists
a complete matching from Vj to V2. This means that the three committees can select three
different representatives. For example, ss can be selected from c;; 53 can be selected from c2,
znd ss can be selected from cs. 5
Example 6| In a certain class, there are equal number of boys and girls, say n. Every girl is
liked by k boys. weil! < ms and every boy by k girls. Is it possible for each boy to go toa
dinner party with a girl he likes and each girl with a boy who likes her?

» Let Vj denote the set of boys and V2 denote the set of girls. Consider the bipartite graph
G=G(V;, V2; E) where E consists of those edges {x,y} where x € V; and y € V2 and x likes y
or vice-versa. y

Then, from what is given, we have deg(x) = k and deg(y) = k for every x € V; and every

y€ V2. Thus, degree of every vertex in V; = k = degree of every vertex in V2. Therefore, there

exists a complete matching from V; to V2, and vice-versa. This means that the answer to the
Py

question asked is “Yes”.

Show that the condition in Theorem 2 is not a necessary condition for the exis-
tence of a complete matching from Vj to V2 in a bipartite graph G(V,, V2; E).

» Consider the bipartite graph shown in Figure 4.67. We note that the degree of every vertex
in V; is 2. Therefore, if there isa positive integer m such that the degree of every vertex in
VY; > m, then m can be 1 or 2. This m is not greater than or equal to the degree of every
vertex in V2; observe that the vertex S in V2 has degree 3. Thus, the condition of Theorem 2
is not satisfied. But the graph has a complete matching. (Note that the edges ey, €4, eg form a

complete matching from V; to V2).
