Function to double queue capacity
void queueFull()
{
int* newQueue;
newQueue=(int*)malloc( 2 * capacity * sizeof(int));
/* copy from queue to newQueue */
int start = (front+1) % capacity;
if (start < 2)
copy(queue+start, queue+start+capacity-1, newQueue);
else
{ /* queue wraps around */
copy(queue+start, queue+capacity, newQueue);
copy(queue, queuetrear+1, newQueue+capacity-start);

/* switch to newQueue */
front= 2 * capacity - 1;
rear = capacity - 2;
capacity *= 2;
free(queue);

queue = newQueue;

}

The function copy(a,b,c) copies elements from locations a through b-1 to locations beginning at c

Deques: A deque (pronounced either as deck or dequeue) is a linear list in which elements
can be added or removed at either end but not in the middle. The term deque is a contraction
of the namedouble ended queue.

Representation: It is represented as a circular array deque with pointers left and right, which point to
the two ends of the queue. It is assumed that the elements extend from the left end to the right end in

the array. The term circular comes from the fact that DEQUE[0] comes after DEQUE[n-1] in the array.
Examplel:
Left=2 A B Cc
Right=4
[0] 0) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
Example2:
Left=5 | A B D E
Right=1
[0] (1) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]

There are two types of deque:
e Input restricted:- insertion is allowed only at one end, deletion is allowed at both ends.
¢ Output restricted: deletion is allowed only at one end, insertion is allowed at both ends
