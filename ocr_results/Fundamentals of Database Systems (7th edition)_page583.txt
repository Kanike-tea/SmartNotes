16.2 Secondary Storage Devices

3. Reading data ahead of request: To minimize seek times, whenever a block
is read into the buffer, blocks from the rest of the track can also be read even
though they may not have been requested yet. This works well for applica-
tions that are likely to need consecutive blocks; for random block reads this
strategy is counterproductive.

4. Proper scheduling of I/O requests: If it is necessary to read several blocks
from disk, total access time can be minimized by scheduling them so that the
arm moves only in one direction and picks up the blocks along its move-
ment. One popular algorithm is called the elevator algorithm; this algorithm
mimics the behavior of an elevator that schedules requests on multiple floors
in a proper sequence. In this way, the arm can service requests along its out-
ward and inward movements without much disruption.

5. Use of log disks to temporarily hold writes: A single disk may be assigned
to just one function called logging of writes. All blocks to be written can go
to that disk sequentially, thus eliminating any seek time. This works much
faster than doing the writes to a file at random locations, which requires a
seek for each write. The log disk can order these writes in (cylinder, track)
ordering to minimize arm movement when writing. Actually, the log disk
can only be an area (extent) of a disk. Having the data file and the log file on
the same disk is a cheaper solution but compromises performance. Although
the idea of a log disk can improve write performance, it is not feasible for
most real-life application data.

6. Use of SSDs or flash memory for recovery purposes: In applications
where updates occur with high frequency, updates can be lost from main
memory if the system crashes. A preventive measure would be to increase
the speed of updates/writes to disk. One possible approach involves writing
the updates to a nonvolatile SSD buffer, which may be a flash memory or
battery-operated DRAM, both of which operate at must faster speeds
(see Table 16.1). The disk controller then updates the data file during its idle
time and also when the buffer becomes full. During recovery from a crash,
unwritten SSD buffers must be written to the data file on HDD. For further
discussion of recovery and logs, consult Chapter 22.

16.2.3 SolidState Device (SSD) Storage

This type of storage is sometimes known as flash storage because it is based on the
flash memory technology, which we discussed in Section 16.1.1.

The recent trend is to use flash memories as an intermediate layer between main
memory and secondary rotating storage in the form of magnetic disks (HDDs).
Since they resemble disks in terms of the ability to store data in secondary storage
without the need for continuous power supply, they are called solid-state disks or
solid-state drives (SSDs). We will discuss SSDs in general terms first and then
comment on their use at the enterprise level, where they are sometimes referred to
as enterprise flash drives (EFDs), a term first introduced by EMC Corporation.
