The gates are blocks of hardware that produce the equivalent of logic-1 or logic-0 output signals if input
logic requirements are satisfied. The input signals x and y in the AND and OR gates may exist in one of
four possible states: 00, 10, 11, or 01. These input signals are shown in Figure together with the
corresponding output signal for each gate. The timing diagrams illustrate the idealized response of each
gate to the four input signal combinations. The low-level represents logic 0, the high-level logic 1. The
AND gate responds with a logic-1 output signal when both input signals are logic 1. The OR gate
responds with a logic-1 output signal if any input signal is logic 1. The NOT gate is commonly referred

to as an inverter.

Gates with Multiple Inputs

AND & OR gates may have more than two inputs. An AND gate with three inputs and an OR gate with
four inputs are shown in Figure. The three-input AND gate responds with logic | output if all three
inputs are logic 1. The output produces logic 0 if any input is logic 0. The four-input OR gate responds

with logic 1 if any input is logic 1; its output becomes logic 0 only when all inputs are logic 0.

Basic Theorems & Properties of Boolean Algebra
Duality

This important property of Boolean algebra is called the duality principle and states that every algebraic
expression deducible from the postulates of Boolean algebra remains valid if the operators and identity

elements are interchanged. In a two-valued Boolean algebra, the identity elements and the elements of
