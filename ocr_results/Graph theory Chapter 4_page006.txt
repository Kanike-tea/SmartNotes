aes ight cities A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are required to be connected: by anew
railway network. The possible tracks and the cost of involved to lay them (in crores of Rupees)
are summarized in the following Table:

Track between Track between

Determine a railway network of minimal cost that connects all these cities.

> Let us first prepare a graph whose vertices Tepresent the cities, edges represent the possible
tracks and weights represent the cost. The graph is as shown in Figure 4.11.
