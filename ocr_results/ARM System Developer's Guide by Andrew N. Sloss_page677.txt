Instruction class Cycles Notes
PLD A
QxADD, QxSUB 1 Rdis not available for one cycle. Rn is required one cycle early
for QDADD and QDSUB.
REV, REV16, REVSH 1 Rmis required one cycle early.
{S,SH,Q,U,UH,UQ} 1 Rdis not available for one cycle for saturating or halving
ADD16, ADDSUBX, operations (SH, Q, UH, UQ prefix).
SUBADDX, SUB16, Rmis required one cycle early for ADDSUBX and SUBADDX
ADD8, SUB8 operations.
SEL 1
SETEND 1
SMULxy, SMLAxy, 1 Rdis not available for two cycles, except as an accumulator input
SMULWy, SMLAWy for another multiply accumulate when it is not available for
SMUAD, SMLAD, one cycle.
SMUSD, SMLSD Rmand Rsare required one cycle early.
SMLALxy, SMLALD{X}, 2 RdLo is not available for one cycle. RdHi is not available for
SMLSLD{X} two cycles. Reduce these latencies by one if these registers are
used as accumulator inputs for another multiply accumulate.
Rmand Rsare required one cycle early. RdHi is not required
until the second cycle.
SMMUL{R}, SMMLA{R}, 2 Rd is not available for two cycles, except as an accumulator
SMMLS{R} input for another multiply accumulate when it is not available
for one cycle.
Rmand Rsare required one cycle early. Rn is not required until
the second cycle.
SSAT, USAT, SSAT16, 1 Rdis not available for one cycle. Rmis required one cycle early
USAT16 for SSAT and USAT.
STR/B/H/D A If the store is potentially unaligned (base or offset unaligned),
then you cannot start a memory access on the next cycle.
For STRD you cannot start another instruction that writes to
R(d + 1) for one cycle.
STM 1 You cannot start another memory access for the next
(N + a — 1)/2 cycles, where ais bit 2 of the address.
You cannot start an instruction that writes to the kth register in
the list for k/2 cycles.
SWI 8
SWP/B 2 Rdis not available for one cycle.
SXT, UXT 1 Rmis required one cycle early.
