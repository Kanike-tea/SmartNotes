Fourth and fifth normal forms.
(a) The EMP relation with two MVDs: Ename — Pname and Ename —> Dname.
(b) Decomposing the EMP relation into two 4NF relations EMP_PROJECTS and

EMP_DEPENDE!

NTS.

(c) The relation SUPPLY with no MVDs is in 4NF but not in 5NF if it has the JD(Ri, Ro, Ra).
(d) Decomposing the relation SUPPLY into the 5NF relations Ri, Ro, Rs

relation state r of R: If two tuples ¢, and f, exist in r such that t;[X] = t,[X], then
two tuples f; and t, should also exist in r with the following properties,” where
we use Z to denote (R - (XU Y)):?°
= t3[X] = ta[X] = 4[X] = b[X]

= 6[Y] =4[Y] and 4[Y] = 6[Y]

= t{Z] = f{Z] and 412] = 4 {21

'8The tuples t1, to, tz, and ty are not necessarily distinct.

207 is shorthand for the attributes in R after the attributes in (X U Y) are removed from R.
