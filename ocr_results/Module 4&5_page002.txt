Modes.

Fig 1: Exceptions and associated modes

Figure 1 shows a simplified view of exceptions and associated modes. Note that when an

exception occurs, the ARM processor always switches to ARM state.

1.2 Vector Table

Vector table — a table of addresses that the ARM core branches to when an exception is raised.

These addresses commonly contain branch instructions of one of the following forms:

B <address> —This branch instruction provides a branch relative from the pc.

LDR pe, [pe, #offset] —This load register instruction loads the handler address from
memory to the pc. The address is an absolute 32-bit value stored close to the vector table.
Loading this absolute literal value results in a slight delay in branching to a specific
handler due to the extra memory access. However, you can branch to any address in

memory.
