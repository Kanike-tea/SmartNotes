Hence we coriclude that the straight line passing through the origin in the z~ plane :
maps onto a hyperbola in the w— plane with foci (+ 2a, 0). :

Since both these conics (ellipse and hyperbola) have the same foci independent of r, 8 - a
they are called confocal conics. ,

Question-1 What are the points at which the transformation ‘w= z+(a?/z) ‘is not
conformal ? Also show that this transformation maps the circle. | - ° :

Since f’(z) = ae # 0 is the sufficient condition for the transformation w = f(z) -

to be conformal the transformation w = z+(a°/z) is not conformal at the points
z=ta.

Discussion of cases 1 and 2 make up the proof for the second part of the question.
Question-2 Discuss the transformation w = z+(1/z) with respect to the curves

r = coristant (+ 0) and @ = constant (# 0). Hence find the image of
r= 1 and 6 = x under this transformation.

>> Thegiventransformation w = z+(1/z) isa particular case of the transformation
w= z+(a2/z) where a = 1 discussed earlier. 7

Proceeding on the same lines we can say that the transformation w = z+(1/z) map

circles |z| = r = constant and straightlines arg z = @ = Constantin the z—plane ©
into confocal conics in the w —plane with foci (+ 2, 0). :
