is ‘Secretary’ belong to the subclass. We display a predicate-defined subclass by
writing the predicate condition next to the line that connects the subclass to the
specialization circle.

If all subclasses in a specialization have their membership condition on the same
attribute of the superclass, the specialization itself is called an attribute-defined
specialization, and the attribute is called the defining attribute of the special-
ization.® In this case, all the entities with the same value for the attribute belong to
the same subclass. We display an attribute-defined specialization by placing the
defining attribute name next to the arc from the circle to the superclass, as shown
in Figure 4.4.

When we do not have a condition for determining membership in a subclass, the
subclass is called user-defined. Membership in such a subclass is determined by the
database users when they apply the operation to add an entity to the subclass; hence,
membership is specified individually for each entity by the user, not by any condi-
tion that may be evaluated automatically.

Two other constraints may apply to a specialization. The first is the disjointness
constraint, which specifies that the subclasses of the specialization must be disjoint
sets. This means that an entity can be a member of at most one of the subclasses of
the specialization. A specialization that is attribute-defined implies the disjointness
constraint (if the attribute used to define the membership predicate is single-
valued). Figure 4.4 illustrates this case, where the d in the circle stands for disjoint. The
d notation also applies to user-defined subclasses of a specialization that must be
disjoint, as illustrated by the specialization {HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE}
in Figure 4.1. If the subclasses are not constrained to be disjoint, their sets of entities

®Such an attribute is called a discriminator or discriminating attribute in UML terminology.
