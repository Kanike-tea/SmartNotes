9.2 Mapping EER Model Constructs to Relations

Each type field t; can have a domain {yes, no}, where a value of yes indicates that the
tuple is a member of subclass S;. If we use this option for the EER specialization in
Figure 4.4, we would include three type attributes—Is_a_secretary, ls_a_engineer, and
Is_a_technician—instead of the Job_type attribute in Figure 9.5(c). Figure 9.5(d)
shows the mapping of the specialization from Figure 4.5 using option 8D.

For a multilevel specialization (or generalization) hierarchy or lattice, we do not have
to follow the same mapping option for all the specializations. Instead, we can use one
mapping option for part of the hierarchy or lattice and other options for other parts.
Figure 9.6 shows one possible mapping into relations for the EER lattice in Figure 4.6.
Here we used option 8A for PERSON/{EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT}, and option
8C for EMPLOYEE/{STAFF, FACULTY, STUDENT_ASSISTANT} by including the
type attribute Employee_type. We then used the single-table option 8D for
STUDENT_ASSISTANT/{RESEARCH_ASSISTANT, TEACHING_ASSISTANT} by including
the type attributes Ta_flag and Ra_flag in EMPLOYEE. We also used option 8D for
STUDENT/STUDENT_ASSISTANT by including the type attributes Student_assist_flag
in STUDENT, and for STUDENT/{GRADUATE_STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT}
by including the type attributes Grad_flag and Undergrad_flag in STUDENT. In Figure 9.6,
all attributes whose names end with type or flag are type fields.

9.2.2 Mapping of Shared Subclasses (Multiple Inheritance)

A shared subclass, such as ENGINEERING_MANAGER in Figure 4.6, is a subclass of
several superclasses, indicating multiple inheritance. These classes must all have the
same key attribute; otherwise, the shared subclass would be modeled as a category
(union type) as we discussed in Section 4.4. We can apply any of the options dis-
cussed in step 8 to a shared subclass, subject to the restrictions discussed in step 8 of
the mapping algorithm. In Figure 9.6, options 8C and 8D are used for the shared
subclass STUDENT_ASSISTANT. Option 8C is used in the EMPLOYEE relation
(Employee_type attribute) and option 8D is used in the STUDENT relation
(Student_assist_flag attribute).
