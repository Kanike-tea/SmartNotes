(b): UPDATEPROJECT SET Pname = ‘ProductY’
WHERE Pname = ‘ProductX’;

Update (a) relates ‘John Smith’ to the ‘ProductY’ PROJECT tuple instead of the ‘Productx’
PROJECT tuple and is the most likely desired update. However, (b) would also give the desired
update effect on the view, but it accomplishes this by changing the name of the ‘ProductX’ tuple in
the PROJECT relation to ‘ProductY’.

It is quite unlikely that the user who specified the view update UV1 wants the update to be
interpreted as in (b), since it also has the side effect of changing all the view tuples with Pname =
‘ProductX’.

Some view updates may not make much sense; for example, modifying the Total_sal attribute of the
DEPT_INFO view does not make sense because Total_sal is defined to be the sum of the individual
employee salaries. This request is shown as UV2:
UV2: UPDATEDEPT_INFO
SET Total_sal=100000
WHERE Dname='Research’;
A large number of updates on the underlying base relations can satisfy this view update.

Generally, a view update is feasible when only one possible update on the base relations can
accomplish the desired update effect on the view. Whenever an update on the view can be mapped
to more than one update on the underlying base relations, we must have a certain procedure for
choosing one of the possible updates as the most likely one.

In summary, we can make the following observations:

= Aview with a single defining table is updatable if the view attributes contain the primary key of the
base relation, as well as all attributes with the NOT NULL constraint that do not have default
values specified.

m Views defined on multiple tables using joins are generally not updatable.

u Views defined using grouping and aggregate functions are not updatable.

In SQL, the clause WITH CHECK OPTION must be added at the end of the view definition if a view

is to be updated. This allows the system to check for view updatability and to plan an execution

strategy for view updates. It is also possible to define a view table in the FROM clause of an SQL

query. This is known as an in-line view. In this case, the view is defined within the query itself.
