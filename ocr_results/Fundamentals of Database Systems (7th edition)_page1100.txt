Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts

28.1 Overview of Data Mining Technology

In reports such as the popular Gartner Report,’ data mining has been hailed as one
of the top technologies for the near future. In this section, we relate data mining to
the broader area called knowledge discovery and contrast the two by means of an
illustrative example.

28.1.1 Data Mining versus Data Warehousing

The goal of a data warehouse (see Chapter 29) is to support decision making with
data. Data mining can be used in conjunction with a data warehouse to help with
certain types of decisions. Data mining can be applied to operational databases with
individual transactions. To make data mining more efficient, the data warehouse
should have an aggregated or summarized collection of data. Data mining helps in
extracting meaningful new patterns that cannot necessarily be found by merely
querying or processing data or meta-data in the data warehouse. Therefore, data
mining applications should be strongly considered early, during the design of a data
warehouse. Also, data mining tools should be designed to facilitate their use in con-
junction with data warehouses. In fact, for very large databases running into tera-
bytes and even petabytes of data, successful use of data mining applications will
depend first on the construction of a data warehouse.

28.1.2 Data Mining as a Part of the Knowledge
Discovery Process

Knowledge discovery in databases, frequently abbreviated as KDD, typically
encompasses more than data mining. The knowledge discovery process comprises
six phases:* data selection, data cleansing, enrichment, data transformation or
encoding, data mining, and the reporting and display of the discovered information.

As an example, consider a transaction database maintained by a specialty consumer
goods retailer. Suppose the client data includes a customer name, zip code, phone
number, date of purchase, item code, price, quantity, and total amount. A variety of
new knowledge can be discovered by KDD processing on this client database. Dur-
ing data selection, data about specific items or categories of items, or from stores in
a specific region or area of the country, may be selected. The data cleansing process
then may correct invalid zip codes or eliminate records with incorrect phone pre-
fixes. Enrichment typically enhances the data with additional sources of informa-
tion. For example, given the client names and phone numbers, the store may
purchase other data about age, income, and credit rating and append them to each
record. Data transformation and encoding may be done to reduce the amount of

'The Gartner Report is one example of the many technology survey publications that corporate
managers rely on to discuss and select data mining technology.
