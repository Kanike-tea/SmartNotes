Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus

CARTESIAN PRODUCT followed by SELECT can be used to define matching tuples
from two relations and leads to the JOIN operation. Different JOIN operations called
THETA JOIN, EQUUOIN, and NATURAL JOIN were introduced. Query trees were intro-
duced as a graphical representation of relational algebra queries, which can also be used
as the basis for internal data structures that the DBMS can use to represent a query.

We discussed some important types of queries that cannot be stated with the basic
relational algebra operations but are important for practical situations. We intro-
duced GENERALIZED PROJECTION to use functions of attributes in the projection
list and the AGGREGATE FUNCTION operation to deal with aggregate types of statis-
tical requests that summarize the information in the tables. We discussed recursive
queries, for which there is no direct support in the algebra but which can be han-
dled in a step-by-step approach, as we demonstrated. Then we presented the OUTER
JOIN and OUTER UNION operations, which extend JOIN and UNION and allow all
information in source relations to be preserved in the result.

The last two sections described the basic concepts behind relational calculus, which
is based on the branch of mathematical logic called predicate calculus. There are
two types of relational calculi: (1) the tuple relational calculus, which uses tuple
variables that range over tuples (rows) of relations, and (2) the domain relational
calculus, which uses domain variables that range over domains (columns of rela-
tions). In relational calculus, a query is specified in a single declarative statement,
without specifying any order or method for retrieving the query result. Hence, rela-
tional calculus is often considered to be a higher-level declarative language than the
relational algebra, because a relational calculus expression states what we want to
retrieve regardless of how the query may be executed.

We introduced query graphs as an internal representation for queries in relational
calculus. We also discussed the existential quantifier (4) and the universal quanti-
fier (V). We discussed the problem of specifying safe queries whose results are
finite. We also discussed rules for transforming universal into existential quantifi-
ers, and vice versa. It is the quantifiers that give expressive power to the relational
calculus, making it equivalent to the basic relational algebra. There is no analog to
grouping and aggregation functions in basic relational calculus, although some
extensions have been suggested.

Review Questions
8.1. List the operations of relational algebra and the purpose of each.

8.2. What is union compatibility? Why do the UNION, INTERSECTION, and
DIFFERENCE operations require that the relations on which they are
applied be union compatible?

8.3. Discuss some types of queries for which renaming of attributes is necessary
in order to specify the query unambiguously.

8.4. Discuss the various types of inner join operations. Why is theta join required?
