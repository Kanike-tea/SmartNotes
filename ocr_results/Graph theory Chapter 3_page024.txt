Show that a Hamilton path is a Spanning tree,

> Recall that a Hamilton path p, if such exists, in'd connected graph G is a path which contains
every vertex of G and that if G has n vertices then p has n — 1 edges, Thus, p is a connected
subgraph of G with n vertices and n — 1 edges. Therefore, p is a tree. Since p contains all
vertices of G, it is a spanning tree of G. { .
