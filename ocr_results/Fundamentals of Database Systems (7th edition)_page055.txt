1.7 A Brief History of Database Applications

to relational databases, since they provided more general data structures. They also
incorporated many of the useful object-oriented paradigms, such as abstract data
types, encapsulation of operations, inheritance, and object identity. However, the
complexity of the model and the lack of an early standard contributed to their lim-
ited use. They are now mainly used in specialized applications, such as engineering
design, multimedia publishing, and manufacturing systems. Despite expectations
that they will make a big impact, their overall penetration into the database prod-
ucts market remains low. In addition, many object-oriented concepts were incor-
porated into the newer versions of relational DBMSs, leading to object-relational
database management systems, known as ORDBMSs.

1.7.4 Interchanging Data on the Web
for E-Commerce Using XML

The World Wide Web provides a large network of interconnected computers.
Users can create static Web pages using a Web publishing language, such as Hyper-
Text Markup Language (HTML), and store these documents on Web servers where
other users (clients) can access them and view them through Web browsers. Docu-
ments can be linked through hyperlinks, which are pointers to other documents.
Starting in the 1990s, electronic commerce (e-commerce) emerged as a major
application on the Web. Much of the critical information on e-commerce Web
pages is dynamically extracted data from DBMSs, such as flight information, prod-
uct prices, and product availability. A variety of techniques were developed to allow
the interchange of dynamically extracted data on the Web for display on Web
pages. The eXtended Markup Language (XML) is one standard for interchanging
data among various types of databases and Web pages. XML combines concepts
from the models used in document systems with database modeling concepts.
Chapter 13 is devoted to an overview of XML.

1.7.5 Extending Database Capabilities
for New Applications

The success of database systems in traditional applications encouraged devel-
opers of other types of applications to attempt to use them. Such applications
traditionally used their own specialized software and file and data structures.
Database systems now offer extensions to better support the specialized require-
ments for some of these applications. The following are some examples of these
applications:

= Scientific applications that store large amounts of data resulting from scien-
tific experiments in areas such as high-energy physics, the mapping of the
human genome, and the discovery of protein structures

= Storage and retrieval of images, including scanned news or personal photo-
graphs, satellite photographic images, and images from medical procedures
such as x-rays and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests
