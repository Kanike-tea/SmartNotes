The null hypothesis that there is no difference between the mean life time of bulbs
is rejected at 5% level but not at 1% level of significance. .

The null hypotliesis is rejected at both the levels of significance in a-one tailed

- test as the respective critical values are 1.645 and 2.33.

26. The mean of two large sariiples lof 1000 and 2000 members are 168.75 cms and 170 cms
respectively. Can the samples be regarded as drawn from the same population of standard
deviation 6.25 cms. ? i

Z = 5.16 is very much greater than Z 9, = 1.96 andalso Z,, = 258. Thus we say
thatthe difference between thesample meansissignificantand we conclude that

‘the samples cannot be regarded as drawn from the same population.

27. ‘A random sample for 1000 workers in company has mean wage of Rs 50 per day and S.D

of Rs 15. Another sample of 1500 workers from another company has mean wage of Rs
45 per day and S.D of Rs 20. Does the mean rate of wages varies between the two
companies ? Find the 95 % confidence limits for the difference of the mean wages of the
population of the two companies.

Hence‘we can say that the difference between
