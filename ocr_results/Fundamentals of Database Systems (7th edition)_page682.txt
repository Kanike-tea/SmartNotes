Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design

and Narang (1992) discuss index creation. The performance of various B-tree and
Bt-tree algorithms is assessed in Baeza-Yates and Larson (1989) and Johnson and
Shasha (1993). Buffer management for indexes is discussed in Chan et al. (1992).
Column-based storage of databases was proposed by Stonebraker et al. (2005) in
the C-Store database system; MonetDB/X100 by Boncz et al. (2008) is another
implementation of the idea. Abadi et al. (2008) discuss the advantages of column
stores over row-stored databases for read-only database applications.

Physical Database Design: Wiederhold (1987) covers issues related to physical
design. O’Neil and O’Neil (2001) provides a detailed discussion of physical design
and transaction issues in reference to commercial RDBMSs. Navathe and Kersch-
berg (1986) discuss all phases of database design and point out the role of data dic-
tionaries. Rozen and Shasha (1991) and Carlis and March (1984) present different
models for the problem of physical database design. Shasha and Bonnet (2002) offer
an elaborate discussion of guidelines for database tuning. Niemiec (2008) is one
among several books available for Oracle database administration and tuning;
Schneider (2006) is focused on designing and tuning MySQL databases.
