showing self-propelled jumping upon drop coalescence (5, 6), we show particle removal
by the merged condensate drop with a size comparable to or larger than that of the
contaminating particle(s). Further, we report a distinct jumping mechanism upon particle
aggregation, without a condensate drop of comparable size to that of the particles, where a
group of particles exposed to water condensate clusters together by capillarity and self-
propels away from the superhydrophobic surface.

3. Explain with neat sketch, the function of shark skin as a friction reducing swim
suit.

Answer:

+ Shark skin refers to the unique and specialized scales similar to teeth, called Dermal
Denticles.

* The Denticles play an important part in swimming efficiency.

+ The teeth and skin also help protect the shark from injuries and several elements in
the water.

* Characteristics and Advantages of Shark Skin:

* Reduced drag: The Denticles have a sleek hydrodynamic shape, which helps reduce
drag as the shark swims through water.

+ Improved manoeuvrability: The structure of the Denticles contribute to enhanced
manoeuvrability

+ Protection: The tough, overlapping nature of the dermal denticles provides a
protective layer for sharks

+  Anti-fouling properties: Shark skin has been observed to possess anti-fouling
properties

+ Bacteriostatic properties: inhibit the growth of certain bacteria, which may be useful
in preventing infections.

Camouflage and counter-shading: Some shark species have specific patterns and
coloration on their skin that serve as camouflage or counter-shading, aiding in their
hunting strategies and protection from predators.

Friction reducing swim suits:

+ Shark skin has inspired the development of swimsuits and other swimwear with the
aim of improving performance for competitive swimmers.

+ The idea behind these swimsuits is to mimic the hydrodynamic properties of shark
skin, particularly its reduced drag and enhanced speed.
