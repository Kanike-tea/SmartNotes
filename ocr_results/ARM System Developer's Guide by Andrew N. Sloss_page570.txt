Figure 15.2 Sum-of-absolute-differences operation.

To implement this using the new instructions, use the following sequence to compute the
sum_-of-absolute differences of four pixels:

LOR pl, [plPtr],#4 5 load 4 pixels from pl
LOR —p2, [p2Ptr],#4 5 load 4 pixels from p2
jload delay-slot
jload delay-slot
USADA8 acc, pl, p2 3 accumlate sum abs diff

There is a tremendous performance advantage for this algorithm over an ARMVSTE
implementation. There is a four times improvement in performance from the eight-bit
SIMD alone. Additionally the USADA8 operation includes the accumulation operation. The
USAD8 operation will typically be used to carry out the setup into the loop before there is an
existing accumulated value.

15.1.6 DUAL 16-BIT MULTIPLY INSTRUCTIONS

ARMVSTE introduced considerable DSP performance to ARM, but ARMv6 takes this much
further. Implementations of ARMv6 (such as ARM1136J) have a dual 16 x 16 multiply
capability, which is comparable with many high-end dedicated DSP devices. Table 15.9 lists
these instructions.
