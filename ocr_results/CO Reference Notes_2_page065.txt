HIGHER-LEVEL GENERATE & PROPAGATE FUNCTIONS
© 16-bit adder can be built from four 4-bit adder blocks (Figure 9.5).
. These blocks provide new output functions defined as
Gk and Pk, where k=0 for the first 4-bit block,
k=1 for the second 4-bit block and so on.
¢ In the first block,
PO=P3P2P1P0
&
G0=G3+P3G2+P3P2G
1+P3P2P1G0
. The first-level Gi and Pj functions determine whether bit stage i generates or propagates a
carry, and the second level Gk and Pk functions determine whether block k generates or propagates a
carry.
. Carry c16 is formed by one of the carry-lookahead
circuits as
¢16=G3+P3G2+P3P2G1+P3P2P1G0+P3P2P1P0c0
¢ Conclusion: All carries are available 5 gate delays after X, Y and cO are applied as inputs.
