Basics of Functional
Dependencies and Normalization
for Relational Databases

n Chapters 5 through 8, we presented various aspects

of the relational model and the languages associated
with it. Each relation schema consists of a number of attributes, and the relational
database schema consists of a number of relation schemas. So far, we have assumed
that attributes are grouped to form a relation schema by using the common sense of
the database designer or by mapping a database schema design from a conceptual
data model such as the ER or enhanced-ER (EER) data model. These models make
the designer identify entity types and relationship types and their respective attri-
butes, which leads to a natural and logical grouping of the attributes into relations
when the mapping procedures discussed in Chapter 9 are followed. However, we
still need some formal way of analyzing why one grouping of attributes into a rela-
tion schema may be better than another. While discussing database design in
Chapters 3, 4, and 9, we did not develop any measure of appropriateness or goodness
to measure the quality of the design, other than the intuition of the designer. In this
chapter we discuss some of the theory that has been developed with the goal of
evaluating relational schemas for design quality—that is, to measure formally why
one set of groupings of attributes into relation schemas is better than another.

There are two levels at which we can discuss the goodness of relation schemas. The
first is the logical (or conceptual) level—how users interpret the relation schemas
and the meaning of their attributes. Having good relation schemas at this level
enables users to understand clearly the meaning of the data in the relations, and
hence to formulate their queries correctly. The second is the implementation (or
physical storage) level—how the tuples in a base relation are stored and updated.
