Find the number of depositors for each branch
select branch-name, count(distinct customer-name)
from Depositor, Account
where Depositor.account-number = Account.account-number
group by branch-name
having clause is used to state condition that applies to groups rather than tuples.
Find the average account balance at each branch where average account balance is more
than Rs. 1200
select branch-name, avg(balance)
from Account
group by branch-name
having avg(balance) > 1200
Count the number of tuples in Customer table
select count(*)
from Customer
SQL doesn’t allow distinct with count(*)
When where and having are both present in a statement where is applied before having.
