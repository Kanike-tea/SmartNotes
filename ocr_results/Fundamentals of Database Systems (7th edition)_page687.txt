18.1 Translating SQL Queries into Relational Algebra and Other Operators

We will concentrate on describing query processing and optimization in the context
of an RDBMS because many of the techniques we describe have also been adapted
for other types of database management systems, such as ODBMSs.* A relational
DBMS must systematically evaluate alternative query execution strategies and
choose a reasonably efficient or near-optimal strategy. Most DBMSs have a number
of general database access algorithms that implement relational algebra operations
such as SELECT or JOIN (see Chapter 8) or combinations of these operations. Only
execution strategies that can be implemented by the DBMS access algorithms and
that apply to the particular query, as well as to the particular physical database design,
can be considered by the query optimization module.

This chapter is organized as follows. Section 18.1 starts with a general discussion of
how SQL queries are typically translated into relational algebra queries and addi-
tional operations and then optimized. Then we discuss algorithms for implementing
relational algebra operations in Sections 18.2 through 18.6. In Section 18.7, we dis-
cuss the strategy for execution called pipelining. Section 18.8 briefly reviews the
strategy for parallel execution of the operators. Section 18.9 summarizes the chapter.

In the next chapter, we will give an overview of query optimization strategies. There
are two main techniques of query optimization that we will be discussing. The first
technique is based on heuristic rules for ordering the operations in a query execu-
tion strategy that works well in most cases but is not guaranteed to work well in
every case. The rules typically reorder the operations in a query tree. The second
technique involves cost estimation of different execution strategies and choosing
the execution plan that minimizes estimated cost. The topics covered in this chapter
require that the reader be familiar with the material presented in several earlier chap-
ters. In particular, the chapters on SQL (Chapters 6 and 7), relational algebra (Chap-
ter 8), and file structures and indexing (Chapters 16 and 17) are a prerequisite to this
chapter. Also, it is important to note that the topic of query processing and optimiza-
tion is vast, and we can only give an introduction to the basic principles and tech-
niques in this and the next chapter. Several important works are mentioned in the
Bibliography of this and the next chapter.

18.1 Translating SQL Queries into Relational
Algebra and Other Operators

In practice, SQL is the query language that is used in most commercial RDBMSs.
An SQL query is first translated into an equivalent extended relational algebra
expression—represented as a query tree data structure—that is then optimized.
Typically, SQL queries are decomposed into query blocks, which form the basic
units that can be translated into the algebraic operators and optimized. A query
block contains a single SELECT-FROM-WHERE expression, as well as GROUP BY

There are some query processing and optimization issues and techniques that are pertinent only to
ODBMSs. However, we do not discuss them here because we give only an introduction to query
processing in this chapter and we do not discuss query optimization until Chapter 19.
