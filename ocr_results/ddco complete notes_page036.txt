connected in a chain through the full adders. The input carry to the adder is CO, and it
ripples through the full adders to the output carry C4.

Four-bit adder

To demonstrate with a specific example, consider the two binary numbers A = 1011
and B = 0011. Their sum S = 1110 is formed with the four-bit adder as follows:

Subscript i: 3 2 1 0

Input carry 0 1 1 0 C;

Augend 1 0 1 1 Aj
Addend 0 0 1 1 B;

Sum 1 1 1 0 S;

Output carry 0 0 1 1 Cist

The input carry CO in the least significant position must be 0.
The value of Ci+1 in a given significant position is the output carry of the full adder.

The carry propagation time is an important attribute of the adder because it limits the
speed with which two numbers are added.
