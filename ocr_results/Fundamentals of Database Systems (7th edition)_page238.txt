7.1.1 Comparisons Involving NULL and Three-Valued Logic

SQL has various rules for dealing with NULL values. Recall from Section 5.1.2 that
NULL is used to represent a missing value, but that it usually has one of three differ-
ent interpretations—value unknown (value exists but is not known, or it is not
known whether or not the value exists), value not available (value exists but is pur-
posely withheld), or value not applicable (the attribute does not apply to this tuple
or is undefined for this tuple). Consider the following examples to illustrate each of
the meanings of NULL.

1. Unknown value. A person’s date of birth is not known, so it is represented
by NULL in the database. An example of the other case of unknown would be
NULL for a person’s home phone because it is not known whether or not the
person has a home phone.

2. Unavailable or withheld value. A person has a home phone but does not
want it to be listed, so it is withheld and represented as NULL in the database.

3. Not applicable attribute. An attribute LastCollegeDegree would be NULL for a
person who has no college degrees because it does not apply to that person.

It is often not possible to determine which of the meanings is intended; for exam-
ple, a NULL for the home phone of a person can have any of the three meanings.
Hence, SQL does not distinguish among the different meanings of NULL.

In general, each individual NULL value is considered to be different from every other
NULL value in the various database records. When a record with NULL in one of its
attributes is involved in a comparison operation, the result is considered to be
UNKNOWN (it may be TRUE or it may be FALSE). Hence, SQL uses a three-valued
logic with values TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN instead of the standard two-valued
(Boolean) logic with values TRUE or FALSE. It is therefore necessary to define the
results (or truth values) of three-valued logical expressions when the logical con-
nectives AND, OR, and NOT are used. Table 7.1 shows the resulting values.
