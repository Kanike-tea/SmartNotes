is one index entry in the index file for each block in the data file. Each index entry has the value of
the primary key field for the first record in a block and a pointer to other block as its two fields
values.

The first record of each block of the data file is known as anchor record of the block.

Primary index is an example of non dense index

(Primary indexes on the ordering key field)

A major problem with primary index as with any ordered file- is insertion and deletion of records.
With a primary Index, the problem is compounded because if we attempt to insert a record in its
correct position in the data file, we not only have to move records to make space for the new record
but also have to change some index entries because moving records will change the anchor records
of some blocks.
