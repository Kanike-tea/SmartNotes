Figure 9.8 shows an ER schema for a database that can be used to keep track of
transport ships and their locations for maritime authorities. Map this schema
into a relational schema and specify all primary keys and foreign keys.

Map the BANK ER schema of Exercise 3.23 (shown in Figure 3.21) into a
relational schema. Specify all primary keys and foreign keys. Repeat for the
AIRLINE schema (Figure 3.20) of Exercise 3.19 and for the other schemas for
Exercises 3.16 through 3.24.

Map the EER diagrams in Figures 4.9 and 4.12 into relational schemas.
Justify your choice of mapping options.

Is it possible to successfully map a binary M:N relationship type without
requiring a new relation? Why or why not?
