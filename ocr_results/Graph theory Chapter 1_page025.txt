raph, the number of vertices of odd degrees is even.

Proof: Consider a graph with 1 vertices. Suppose k of these vertices are of odd degree so thy

In view of the hand shaking property, the sum on the left hand side of the above expression

is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph. As such, this sum is even. Further, the

second sum in the right hand side is the sum of the degrees of vertices with even degrees. As

such, this sum is also even. Therefore, the first sum in the right hand side must also be even,

that is,

Q)

deg(v;) + deg(v2) + --» + deg(vz) = even.
But, each of deg(v;), deg(v2), .--. deg(v,) is odd. Therefore, the number of terms in the left
hand side of (2) must be even, that is, k is even.
This completes the proof of the theorem.
Note: According to the above theorem, in any graph, there is an even num!
odd degrees. But, it is not true in general that a graph must have an odd number of vertices of
even degrees. Observe that the graph shown in Figure 1.33 has an even number of vertices of

ber of vertices of

even degrees.

For the graph shown in Figure 1.39, indicate the degree of each vertex and verify.
