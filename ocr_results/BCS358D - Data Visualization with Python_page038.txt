8. If result is not None, indicating that the calculation was successful and n is a valid input,
the program prints a message indicating the position and value of the calculated

Fibonacci term.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the two preceding
terms. The program uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci terms based on the position

provided by the user. Note that for large values of n, the recursive approach may become

inefficient.

PROGRAM

def fibonacci(n):
if n <= 0:

print ("Error: N must be greater than 0.")
return None
elif n == 1:
return 0
elif n == 2:
return 1
else:
return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
n = int(input("Enter a value for N: "))
result = fibonacci (n)
if result is not None:
print("The", n, "th term of the Fibonacci sequence is", result

OUTPUT

//Output 01
Enter a value for N: 10
The 10 th term of the Fibonacci sequence is 34

//Output 02

Enter a value for N: 20
The 20 th term of the Fibonacci sequence is 4181
