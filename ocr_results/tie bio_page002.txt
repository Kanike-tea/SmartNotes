renewability, and non-toxicity, PLA is considered today as one of the most commercially
promising bioplastics. When compared with most other biodegradable polymers, PLA has
better durability, transparency, and mechanical strength.

PHAs are a significant polymer family that are 100% bio-based and bio-degradable. PHAs
are microbiologically produced polyesters that have tunable physical and mechanical
properties. This is accompanied by low environmental impact due to their biodegradability
and non-toxicity nature. Therefore, they are promising candidates for a sustainable future
manufacturing. Ranging from brittle thermoplastics to gummy elastomers, PHAs' properties
can be altered by the selection of bacteria, fermentation conditions, and substrate. Due to
their flexible properties, PHAs can eventually substitute PP, polyethylene (PE), and
polystyrene (PS), which are the main polymers of today's global polymer market.

Advantages of PLA Bio plastics

+ PLA plastics are derived from biomass, thus it is biodegradable and more
environmentally friendly.

* As compared to other plastic production, PLA plastics require less energy to produce.

+ When polylactic plastic degrades, it transforms into natural materials like carbon-di-
oxide, water which reduces plastic waste.

+ Since PLA is a thermoplastic, it can be melted, recycled and reshaped without
changing its chemical properties.

* It is carbon neutral, which means it doesn’t emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
when recycled.

* PLA is non-toxic, that’s why it is used in the food packaging and medical industry.

* When oxygenated, it does not produce any toxic fumes as synthetic plastics do.

4. Define nucleic acids. Explain the DNA vaccine structure for Rabies.
Answer:

+ Nucleic acids are biopolymers, macromolecules, essential to all known forms of
life. They are composed of nucleotides, which are the monomer components:

+ A 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base. The two main classes of
nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). If
the sugar is ribose, the polymer is RNA; if the sugar is the ribose
derivative deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA.

+ Rabies is a preventable viral disease most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid
animal. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system of mammals, ultimately
causing disease in the brain and death. Most rabies cases reported to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year occur in wild animals like bats,
raccoons, skunks, and foxes, although any mammal can get rabies.

+ A DNA vaccine, using a pCl-neo plasmid encoding the glycoprotein gene of a
Mexican isolate of rabies virus, was developed to induce long-lasting protective
immunity against rabies virus in dogs.
