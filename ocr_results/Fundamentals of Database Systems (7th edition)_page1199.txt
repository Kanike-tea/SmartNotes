Appendix B Parameters of Disks 1169

Another parameter of disks is the rewrite time. This is useful in cases when we read
a block from the disk into a main memory buffer, update the buffer, and then write
the buffer back to the same disk block on which it was stored. In many cases, the
time required to update the buffer in main memory is less than the time required for
one disk revolution. If we know that the buffer is ready for rewriting, the system can
keep the disk heads on the same track, and during the next disk revolution the
updated buffer is rewritten back to the disk block. Hence, the rewrite time T;,,, is
usually estimated to be the time needed for one disk revolution:

Ty = 2 * rd msec = 60000/p msec

To summarize, the following is a list of the parameters we have discussed and the
symbols we use for them:

Seek time: s msec

Rotational delay: rd msec

Block transfer time: btt msec

Rewrite time: Ty msec

Transfer rate: tr bytes/msec

Bulk transfer rate: btr bytes/msec

Block size: B bytes

Interblock gap size: Gbytes

Disk speed: Pp rpm (revolutions per minute)
