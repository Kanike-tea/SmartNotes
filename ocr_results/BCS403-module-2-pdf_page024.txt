The result of the JOIN is a relation Q with n + m attributes Q(A1, Ay, ..., An,Bi, Ba, ..., Bm in that
order.Q has one tuple for each combination of tuples—one from R and one from S—whenever the
combination satisfies the join condition. This is the main difference between CARTESIAN
PRODUCT and JOIN. In JOIN, only combinations of tuples satisfying the join condition appear
in the result, whereas in the CARTESIAN PRODUCT all combinations of tuples are included in
the result. The join condition is specified on attributes from the two relations R and S and is

evaluated for each combination of tuples.

Each tuple combination for which the join condition evaluates to TRUE is included in the resulting

relation Q as a single combined tuple. A general join condition is of the form
<condition> AND <condition> AND...AND <condition>

where each <condition> is of the form Aj 0 B;, Ai is an attribute of R, B is an attribute of S, Ai

and Bj have the same domain, and 6 (theta) is one of the comparison operators. {=, < <>, >, #}.A
JOIN operation with such a general join condition is called'a THETA JOIN. Tuples whose join

attributes are NULL or for which the join condition is FALSE do not appear in the result.

2.4.2 Variations of JOIN: The EQUIJOIN and NATURAL JOIN
The most common use of JOIN involves join conditions with equality comparisons only. Such a
JOIN, where the only comparison operator used is =, is called an EQUIJOIN.In the result of an

EQUIJOIN we always have one or more pairs of attributes that have identical values in every tuple.

For example the values of the attributes Mgr_ssn and Ssn are identical in every tuple of
DEPT_MGR (the EQUIJOIN tesult) because the equality join condition specified on these two

attributes requires the values to be identical in every tuple in the result.

The standard definition of NATURAL JOIN requires that the two join attributes (or each pair of
join attributes) have the same name in both relations. If this is not the case, a renaming operation is
applied first. Suppose we want to combine each PROJECT tuple with the DEPARTMENT tuple that
controls the project.first we rename the Dnumber attribute of DEPARTMENT to Dnum—so that it

has the same name as the Dnum attribute in PROJECT—and then we apply NATURAL JOIN:
PROJ_DEPT <— PROJECT * pcname, Daum, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date) (DEPARTMENT)
The same query can be done in two steps by creating an intermediate table DEPT as follows:

DEPT <— poname, Daum, Mgr_ssn,Mgr_start_date)( DEPARTMENT)
