1152 Chapter 30 Database Security

cryptographic algorithm relies on one key for encryption and a different but related
key for decryption. The essential steps are as follows:

1. Each user generates a pair of keys to be used for the encryption and decryp-
tion of messages.

2. Each user places one of the two keys in a public register or other accessible
file. This is the public key. The companion key is kept private.

3. Ifa sender wishes to send a private message to a receiver, the sender encrypts
the message using the receiver’s public key.

4, When the receiver receives the message, he or she decrypts it using the
receiver’s private key. No other recipient can decrypt the message because
only the receiver knows his or her private key.

The RSA Public Key Encryption Algorithm. One of the first public key schemes
was introduced in 1978 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman at MIT* and
is named after them as the RSA scheme. The RSA scheme has since then reigned
supreme as the most widely accepted and implemented approach to public key
encryption. The RSA encryption algorithm incorporates results from number the-
ory, combined with the difficulty of determining the prime factors of a target. The
RSA algorithm also operates with modular arithmetic—mod n.

Two keys, d and e, are used for decryption and encryption. An important property
is that they can be interchanged. n is chosen as a large integer that is a product of
two large distinct prime numbers, a and b, n = a x b. The encryption key e is a ran-
domly chosen number between 1 and n that is relatively prime to (a — 1) x (b — 1).
The plaintext block P is encrypted as P* where P’ = P mod n. Because the exponen-
tiation is performed mod n, factoring P* to uncover the encrypted plaintext is diffi-
cult. However, the decrypting key d is carefully chosen so that (P*)d mod n = P. The
decryption key d can be computed from the condition that d x e = 1 mod ((a - 1) x
(b- 1)). Thus, the legitimate receiver who knows d simply computes (P*)d mod n =
P and recovers P without having to factor P*.

30.7.4 Digital Signatures

A digital signature is an example of using encryption techniques to provide authen-
tication services in electronic commerce applications. Like a handwritten signature,
a digital signature is a means of associating a mark unique to an individual with a
body of text. The mark should be unforgettable, meaning that others should be able
to check that the signature comes from the originator.

A digital signature consists of a string of symbols. If a person’s digital signature
were always the same for each message, then one could easily counterfeit it by sim-
ply copying the string of symbols. Thus, signatures must be different for each use.
This can be achieved by making each digital signature a function of the message
