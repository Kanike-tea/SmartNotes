A.3 Alphabetical List of ARM and Thumb Instructions 595

Examples
MVN v0, #0xff 3 70 = Oxffffff00
MVN 0, #0 3rd = -1
NEG Negate value in Thumb (use RSB to negate in ARM state)
1. NEG Ld, Lm THUMBv1
Action Effect on the cpsr
1. Ld = -Lm Updated (see Notes below)
Notes
The cpsr is updated: N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>, C = <NoUnsignedOverflow>, V =
<SignedOverflow>. Note that Z = Cand V = (Ld==0x80000000).
This is the same as the operation RSBS Ld, Lm, #0 in ARM state.
NOP No operation
1. NOP MACRO
This is not an ARM instruction. It isan assembly macro that produces an instruction having
no effect other than advancing the pce as normal. In ARM state it assembles to MOV r0,r0.
In Thumb state it assembles to MOV r8,r8. The operation is not guaranteed to take one
processor cycle. In particular, if you use NOP after a load of r0, then the operation may cause
pipeline interlocks.
ORR Logical bitwise OR of two 32-bit values

1. ORR<cond>{S} Rd, Rn, #<rotated_immed> ARMv1
2. ORR<cond>{$} Rd, Rn, Rm {, <shift>} ARMv1
3. ORR Ld, Lm THUMBv 1
Action Effect on the cpsr

1. Rd = Rn | <rotated_immed> Updated if S suffix specified

2. Rd = Rn | <shifted_Rm> Updated if S suffix specified

3. Ld = Ld | Lm Updated (see Notes below)
