Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory

processing in database systems. Section 20.3 presents the important properties of
atomicity, consistency preservation, isolation, and durability or permanency—
called the ACID properties—that are considered desirable in transaction process-
ing systems. Section 20.4 introduces the concept of schedules (or histories) of
executing transactions and characterizes the recoverability of schedules. Sec-
tion 20.5 discusses the notion of serializability of concurrent transaction execution,
which can be used to define correct execution sequences (or schedules) of concur-
rent transactions. In Section 20.6, we present some of the commands that support
the transaction concept in SQL, and we introduce the concepts of isolation levels.
Section 20.7 summarizes the chapter.

The two following chapters continue with more details on the actual methods and
techniques used to support transaction processing. Chapter 21 gives an overview
of the basic concurrency control protocols and Chapter 22 introduces recovery
techniques.

20.1 Introduction to Transaction Processing

In this section, we discuss the concepts of concurrent execution of transactions and
recovery from transaction failures. Section 20.1.1 compares single-user and multi-
user database systems and demonstrates how concurrent execution of transactions
can take place in multiuser systems. Section 20.1.2 defines the concept of transac-
tion and presents a simple model of transaction execution based on read and write
database operations. This model is used as the basis for defining and formalizing
concurrency control and recovery concepts. Section 20.1.3 uses informal examples
to show why concurrency control techniques are needed in multiuser systems.
Finally, Section 20.1.4 discusses why techniques are needed to handle recovery
from system and transaction failures by discussing the different ways in which
transactions can fail while executing.

20.1.1 Single-User versus Multiuser Systems

One criterion for classifying a database system is according to the number of users
who can use the system concurrently. A DBMS is single-user if at most one user at
a time can use the system, and it is multiuser if many users can use the system—
and hence access the database—concurrently. Single-user DBMSs are mostly
restricted to personal computer systems; most other DBMSs are multiuser. For
example, an airline reservations system is used by hundreds of users and travel
agents concurrently. Database systems used in banks, insurance agencies, stock
exchanges, supermarkets, and many other applications are multiuser systems. In
these systems, hundreds or thousands of users are typically operating on the data-
base by submitting transactions concurrently to the system.

Multiple users can access databases—and use computer systems—simultaneously
because of the concept of multiprogramming, which allows the operating system of
the computer to execute multiple programs—or processes—at the same time. A single
