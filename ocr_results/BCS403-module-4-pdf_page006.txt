1.1.6 Joined Tables in SQL and Outer Joins

An SQL join clause combines records from two or more tables in a database. It creates a set that
can be saved as a table or used as is. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by
using values common to each. SQL specifies four types of JOIN

1. INNER,

2. OUTER

3. EQUIJOIN and

4. NATURAL JOIN

INNER JOIN

An inner join is the most common join operation used in applications and can be regarded as the
default join-type. Inner join creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (A
and B) based upon the join- predicate (the condition). The result.of the join can be defined as the
outcome of first taking the Cartesian product (or Cross join) of all records in the tables (combining
every record in table A with every record in table B)—then return all records which satisfy the join
predicate

Example: SELECT * FROM employee

INNER JOIN department ON

employee.dno = department.dnumber;

EQUIJOIN and NATURAL JOIN
An EQUIJOIN is a specific type of comparator-based join that uses only equality comparisons in the
join-predicate. Using other comparison operators (such as <) disqualifies a join as an equijoin.

NATURAL JOIN is a type of EQUIJOIN where the join predicate arises implicitly by comparing all
columns in both tables that have the same column-names in the joined tables. The resulting joined
table contains only one column for each pair of equally named columns.

SELECT Fname, Lname, Address

FROM EMPLOYEE) NATURAL JOIN
DEPARTMENT

WHERE Dname=‘Research ;
