The kidney is a complex organ that acts as a filtration system for the body. It removes waste
and excess fluid from the bloodstream and maintains a delicate balance of electrolytes, hormones,
and other substances that are critical for the body's normal functioning.

The kidney also plays an important role in regulating blood pressure by secreting the
hormone renin, which helps control the balance of fluid and electrolytes in the body. It also regulates
red blood cell production and the levels of various minerals in the blood, such as_ calcium and
phosphorus.

Without the kidney, waste and excess fluid would accumulate in the body, leading to serious
health problems.

Architecture of Kidney

The kidney is composed of functional units called nephrons, which are the basic
structural and functional units of the kidney. Each kidney contains approximately one million
nephrons, and each nephron performs the functions of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.
