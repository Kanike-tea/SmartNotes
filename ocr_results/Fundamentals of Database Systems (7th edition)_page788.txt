Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory

= Isolation. A transaction should appear as though it is being executed in iso-
lation from other transactions, even though many transactions are execut-
ing concurrently. That is, the execution of a transaction should not be
interfered with by any other transactions executing concurrently.

= Durability or permanency. The changes applied to the database by a com-
mitted transaction must persist in the database. These changes must not be
lost because of any failure.

The atomicity property requires that we execute a transaction to completion. It is
the responsibility of the transaction recovery subsystem of a DBMS to ensure atomi-
city. Ifa transaction fails to complete for some reason, such as a system crash in the
midst of transaction execution, the recovery technique must undo any effects of the
transaction on the database. On the other hand, write operations of a committed
transaction must be eventually written to disk.

The preservation of consistency is generally considered to be the responsibility of
the programmers who write the database programs and of the DBMS module
that enforces integrity constraints. Recall that a database state is a collection of
all the stored data items (values) in the database at a given point in time. A
consistent state of the database satisfies the constraints specified in the schema
as well as any other constraints on the database that should hold. A database
program should be written in a way that guarantees that, if the database is in a
consistent state before executing the transaction, it will be in a consistent state
after the complete execution of the transaction, assuming that no interference
with other transactions occurs.

The isolation property is enforced by the concurrency control subsystem of the
DBMS.* If every transaction does not make its updates (write operations) visible to
other transactions until it is committed, one form of isolation is enforced that
solves the temporary update problem and eliminates cascading rollbacks (see
Chapter 22) but does not eliminate all other problems.

The durability property is the responsibility of the recovery subsystem of the DBMS.
In the next section, we introduce how recovery protocols enforce durability and
atomicity and then discuss this in more detail in Chapter 22.

Levels of Isolation. There have been attempts to define the level of isolation of a
transaction. A transaction is said to have level 0 (zero) isolation if it does not over-
write the dirty reads of higher-level transactions. Level 1 (one) isolation has no lost
updates, and level 2 isolation has no lost updates and no dirty reads. Finally, level 3
isolation (also called true isolation) has, in addition to level 2 properties, repeatable
reads.° Another type of isolation is called snapshot isolation, and several practical
concurrency control methods are based on this. We shall discuss snapshot isolation
in Section 20.6, and again in Chapter 21, Section 21.4.

8We will discuss concurrency control protocols in Chapter 21.

°The SQL syntax for isolation level discussed in Section 206 is closely related to these levels.
