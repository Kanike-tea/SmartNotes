the set B are the same: | and 0. The duality principle has many applications. If the dual of an algebraic
expression is desired, we simply interchange OR and AND operators and replace 1’s by 0’s and 0’s by

l’s
Basic Theorems

Table lists six theorems of Boolean algebra and four of its postulates. The theorems and postulates listed
are the most basic relationships in Boolean algebra. The theorems, like the postulates, are listed in pairs;
each relation is the dual of the one paired with it. The postulates are basic axioms of the algebraic

structure and need no proof. The theorems must be proven from the postulates.

Postulates and Theorems of Boolean Algebra

Postulate 2 (a) x+0=x (b) xel=x
