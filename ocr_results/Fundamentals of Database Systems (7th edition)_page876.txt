Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts

23.1.6 Advantages of Distributed Databases

Some important advantages of DDB are listed below.

1. Improved ease and flexibility of application development. Developing
and maintaining applications at geographically distributed sites of an
organization is facilitated due to transparency of data distribution and
control.

2. Increased availability. This is achieved by the isolation of faults to their
site of origin without affecting the other database nodes connected to the
network. When the data and DDBMS software are distributed over many
sites, one site may fail while other sites continue to operate. Only the data
and software that exist at the failed site cannot be accessed. Further
improvement is achieved by judiciously replicating data and software at
more than one site. In a centralized system, failure at a single site makes
the whole system unavailable to all users. In a distributed database, some
of the data may be unreachable, but users may still be able to access other
parts of the database. If the data in the failed site has been replicated at
another site prior to the failure, then the user will not be affected at all. The
ability of the system to survive network partitioning also contributes to
high availability.

3. Improved performance. A distributed DBMS fragments the database
by keeping the data closer to where it is needed most. Data localization
reduces the contention for CPU and I/O services and simultaneously
reduces access delays involved in wide area networks. When a large
database is distributed over multiple sites, smaller databases exist at
each site. As a result, local queries and transactions accessing data at a
single site have better performance because of the smaller local data-
bases. In addition, each site has a smaller number of transactions exe-
cuting than if all transactions are submitted to a single centralized
database. Moreover, interquery and intraquery parallelism can be
achieved by executing multiple queries at different sites, or by breaking
up a query into a number of subqueries that execute in parallel. This
contributes to improved performance.

4. Easier expansion via scalability. In a distributed environment, expansion
of the system in terms of adding more data, increasing database sizes, or
adding more nodes is much easier than in centralized (non-distributed)
systems.

The transparencies we discussed in Section 23.1.2 lead to a compromise between
ease of use and the overhead cost of providing transparency. Total transparency
provides the global user with a view of the entire DDBS as if it is a single centralized
system. Transparency is provided as a complement to autonomy, which gives the
users tighter control over local databases. Transparency features may be imple-
mented as a part of the user language, which may translate the required services
into appropriate operations.
