Exercises 835

22.18. What do the terms steal/no-steal and force/no-force mean with regard to buf-
fer management for transaction processing?

22.19. Describe the two-phase commit protocol for multidatabase transactions.

22.20. Discuss how disaster recovery from catastrophic failures is handled.

Exercises

22.21. Suppose that the system crashes before the [read_item, T3, A] entry is written to
the log in Figure 22.1(b). Will that make any difference in the recovery process?

22.22. Suppose that the system crashes before the [write_item, T, D, 25, 26] entry is
written to the log in Figure 22.1(b). Will that make any difference in the
recovery process?

22.23. Figure 22.6 shows the log corresponding to a particular schedule at the point
of a system crash for four transactions T), T>, T3, and Ty. Suppose that we
use the immediate update protocol with checkpointing. Describe the recov-
ery process from the system crash. Specify which transactions are rolled
back, which operations in the log are redone and which (if any) are undone,
and whether any cascading rollback takes place.

corresponding log.
