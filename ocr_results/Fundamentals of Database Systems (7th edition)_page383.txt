11.3 Overview of PHP Database Programming

5. $_SERVER[ 'QUERY_STRING' }. This provides the string that holds parame-
ters in a URL after a question mark (?) at the end of the URL. This can hold
search parameters, for example.

6. $_SERVER[ 'DOCUMENT_ROOT' ]. This is the root directory that holds the
files on the Web server that are accessible to client users.

These and other entries in the $_SERVER array are usually needed when creating
the HTML file to be sent to the client for display.

Another important PHP auto-global built-in array variable is called $_Post. This
provides the programmer with input values submitted by the user through HTML
forms specified in the HTML <1nput> tag and other similar tags. For example, in
Figure 11.4, line 14, the variable $_PosT[ 'user_name' ] provides the programmer
with the value typed in by the user in the HTML form specified via the <INPUT> tag
on line 8 in Figure 11.4. The keys to this array are the names of the various input
parameters provided via the form, for example by using the name attribute of the
HTML <rnput> tag as on line 8. When users enter data through forms, the data
values are stored in this array.

11.3 Overview of PHP Database Programming

There are various techniques for accessing a database through a programming lan-
guage. We discussed some of the techniques in Chapter 10, in the overviews of how
to access an SQL database using the C and Java programming languages. In particu-
lar, we discussed embedded SQL, JDBC, SQL/CLI (similar to ODBC), and SQL]. In
this section we give an overview of how to access the database using the script lan-
guage PHP, which is suitable for creating Web interfaces for searching and updat-
ing databases, as well as dynamic Web pages.

There is a PHP database access function library that is part of PHP Extension and
Application Repository (PEAR), which is a collection of several libraries of func-
tions for enhancing PHP. The PEAR DB library provides functions for database
access. Many database systems can be accessed from this library, including Oracle,
MySQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQLServer, among others.

We will discuss several functions that are part of PEAR DB in the context of some
examples. Section 11.3.1 shows how to connect to a database using PHP. Sec-
tion 11.3.2 discusses how data collected from HTML forms can be used to insert a
new record in a database table. Section 11.3.3 shows how retrieval queries can be
executed and have their results displayed within a dynamic Web page.

11.3.1 Connecting to a Database

To use the database functions in a PHP program, the PEAR DB library module
called DB. php must be loaded. In Figure 11.6, this is done in line 0 of the example.
The DB library functions can now be accessed using DB: :<function_name>.
The function for connecting to a database is called DB: :connect('string'),
