Database Management System [BCS403]

hierarchical model represents data as hierarchical tree structures. Each hierarchy
represents a number of related records.

= Native XML DBMS: uses hierarchical tree structures. It combines database
concepts with concepts from document representation models. Data is represented
as elements; with the use of tags, data can be nested to create complex hierarchical
structures.

2. Number of users supported by the system
= Single-user: support only one user at a time and are mostly used with PCs.

= Multiuser: support concurrent multiple users.
3. Number of sites over which the database is distributed

= Centralized: data is stored at a single computer site
= Distributed: can have the actual database and DBMS software distributed over
many sites, connected by a computer network
- Homogeneous DDBMSs use the same DBMS software at all the sites
- Heterogeneous DDBMSs can use different DBMS software at each site
4. Cost
= Open source: products like MySQL and PostgreSQL that are supported by third-
party vendors with additional services.
= Different types of licensing: Standalone single user versions of some systems like
Microsoft Access are sold per copy or included in the overall configuration of
a desktop or laptop. In addition, data warehousing and mining features, as
wellas support for additional data types, are made available at extra cost.

5. On the basis of the types of access path options for storing files
- One well-known family of DBMSs is based on inverted file structures.

.6. General purpose or Special purpose

- When performance is a primary consideration, a special-purpose DBMS can be designed
and built for a specific application; such a system cannot be used for other applications
without major changes. Many airline reservations and telephone directory systems

developed in the past are special-purpose DBMSs.
