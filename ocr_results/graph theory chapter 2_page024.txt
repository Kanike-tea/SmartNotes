2.4. Dual of a planar graph

Figure 2.31

| For example, consider the connected planar graph G a plane drawing of which is shown in
Figure 2.31. We observe that the drawing divides the plane into three regions Ri, R2 and R3,
of which R3 is unbounded. We construct the dual G* of G by using the afore-stated procedure.
The step-by-step description of the construction is given below.

We choose three points vj, V5, V3 inside the regions Rj, Ro, R3, respectively.

The regions Ry and R2 have a common edge es. We draw a line e§ joining v; and v} that
crosses és exactly once.

The regions R; and R3 have two common edges e}, e2. We draw two lines e}, 65 between
v, and v3, with e} crossing only e; and e5 crossing only ep.

The regions R2 and R3 have two common edges e3, e4. We draw two lines e3, e, between
v and v3, with e3 crossing only e3 and e} crossing only eq.

The edge eg is completely contained in R3. We draw a loop e¢ at v3 intersecting eg exactly
once,

The construction of G* is now complete. For G*, the points vj, v3, v5 are the vertices and
the lines ef, €3, €3, e4, es and eg are the edges.
