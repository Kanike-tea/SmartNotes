Multiplying and collecting the coefficientof the like terms, this equation canbeputin
the form

Pww + Qw+Rw+S=0 : s'Q)

where P= (Add -Bed- Bed +Ccc)
Q=(- Abd + Bad + Bbc - Cac)
R=(- Abd + Bbc + Bad ~ Cac)
S$ =(Abb~ Bab— Bba +Caa)
It may be observed that R = Q and hence (2) assumes the form
Pww +Qw+Qw+S=0 cont)
Further Q Q - PS canbe simaphtied into the form
(BB - AC) (ad ~ be) (ad - bc) = (BB- ~AC)lad-bcl?
( ae= lal? for any complex constant ©) :
We conclude that QQ - PS 2 0 aswehave BB 2 AC by data
QQ2Ps

Hence we conclude that equation (3) represents a circle. It is obvious that a straight line
is transformed into a straingt line as a straight line can be regarded as a circle of infinite, _
radius. ( It can be worked independently also ).

Thus we have proved that every bilinear transformation map circles or straight lines _
in the 2- plane into circles or straight lines in the w-plane. 1

WORKED PROBLEMS
Finding the bilinear transformation given the image of a set of three points.

Working procedure for problems

® Given Wy Wy Ws; corresponding to Zy 2 2% We assume the bilinear:

az +b
atd

transformation in the form w =

© We substitute the given set of points to obtain a set re three equations in four .

unknowns 4, b, c, d.

© Wededucea pair of equation in any three unknowns and solve by the rule of cross
multiplication to obtain a proportionate set of values for the three unknowns.
