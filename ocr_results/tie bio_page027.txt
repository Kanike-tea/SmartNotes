Kingfisher Beak —Bullet Train:

a

The front design of the Bullet Train(Shinkansen N700 series), introduced in Japan in
2007, was inspired by the kingfisher's beak.

The new nose design helped reduce noise and improve aerodynamics, resulting in a
smoother and quieter ride.

These trains breaking through the barrier of tunnel air and outside-air and the trains
became quieter and more efficient as the geometry of its nose became more like the
shape of a kingfisher’s beak.

The trains are energy efficient requiring 15% less energy while traveling even faster
than before.

Write short note on a. Bionic leaf b. human blood substitutes. c. Photovoltaic cells.

Answer:

BIONIC LEAF:

The bionic leaf (artificial leaf) is an innovative technology inspired by the process of
photosynthesis in plants.

It aims to harness solar energy and use it to convert carbon dioxide into useful fuels or
other valuable chemical compounds, just like the energy conversion process that
occurs in natural leaves.

The process:

Sunlight is absorbed by the solar panel component of the bionic leaf.
The absorbed sunlight activates the catalysts within the system.
The activated catalysts split water (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and protons (H+).

The protons are then used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemical
compounds, such as hydrogen (H2) gas or liquid fuels like methanol.
