(ii) Ifthe vertices a and b are to have different colours, then there are 4 choices for colouring
the vertex a and (A — 1) choices for the vertex b (or vice versa). Consequently, there are
(A — 2) choices for each of the vertices x, y, z. Hence the number of proper colourings

{in this case) is A(A ~ 1)(A = 2)°.
