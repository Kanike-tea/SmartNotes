architectural characteristic across all the pipelines. Note when the processor is in Thumb
state the pcis the instruction address plus 4.

There are three other characteristics of the pipeline worth mentioning. First, the exe-
cution of a branch instruction or branching by the direct modification of the pc causes the
ARM core to flush its pipeline.

Second, ARM10 uses branch prediction, which reduces the effect of a pipeline flush by
predicting possible branches and loading the new branch address prior to the execution of
the instruction.

Third, an instruction in the execute stage will complete even though an interrupt has
been raised. Other instructions in the pipeline will be abandoned, and the processor will
start filling the pipeline from the appropriate entry in the vector table.
