Drawback of Queue
When item enters and deleted from the queue, the queue gradually shifts to the right as

shown in figure.

t

In this above situation, when we try to insert another item, which shows that the queue is
full. This means that the rear index equals to MAX_QUEUE_SIZE -1. But even if the

space is available at the front end, rear insertion cannot be done.

Overcome of Drawback using different methods

Method _1:

e When an item is deleted from the queue, move the entire queue to the left so that the
first element is again at queue[0] and front is at -1. It should also recalculate rear so
that it is correctly positioned.

e Shifting an array is very time-consuming when there are many elements in queue &

queueFull has worst case complexity of O(MAX_QUEUE_SIZE)

item B is deleted
