is a fixed length to allow the pipeline to fetch future instructions before decoding the current
instruction. But in CISC processors the instructions are often of variable size and take many

cycles to execute.

Pipelines— The processing of instructions is broken down into smaller units that can be
executed in parallel by pipelines. For maximum throughput pipeline advances one step on
each cycle. Instructions can be decoded in one pipeline stage. But in CISC processor

instructions are divided as microcoded instructions.

Registers—RISC machines have a large general-purpose register set. Any register can
contain either data or an address. Registers act as the fast local memory store for all data
processing operations. In contrast, CISC processors have dedicated registers for specific

purposes.

Load-store architecture— The processor operates on data held in registers. Separate load and
store instructions transfer data between the register bank and external memory. Memory
accesses are costly, so separating memory accesses from data processing provides an

advantage because data items held in the register bank can be accessed multiple times without

need of multiple memory accesses. But in CISC design the data processing operations can act

on memory directly.

3. The ARM Design Philosophy

The ARM processor specifically designed to be small to reduce power consumption and
extend battery operation—essential for applications such as mobile phones and personal

digital assistants (PDAs).

High code density is another major requirement since embedded systems have limited
memory due to cost and/or physical size restrictions. High code density is useful for
applications that have limited on-board memory, such as mobile phones and mass storage

devices.

Embedded systems are price sensitive and use slow and low-cost memory devices. The

ability to use low-cost memory devices produces substantial savings.

Another important requirement is to reduce the area of the die taken up by the embedded

processor. For a single-chip solution, the smaller the area used by the embedded processor,
