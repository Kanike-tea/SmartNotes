dynamic arrays, with no fixed number of elements. They can be numerically
indexed arrays whose indexes (positions) are numbered (0, 1, 2, ... ), or they
can be associative arrays whose indexes can be any string values. For exam-
ple, an associative array indexed based on color can have the indexes {“red”,
“blue”, “green”}. In this example, $_Post is associatively indexed by the
name of the posted value user_name that is specified in the name attribute of
the input tag on line 10. Thus $_PostT[ 'user_name' ] will contain the value
typed in by the user. We will discuss PHP arrays further in Section 11.2.2.

5. When the Web page at http://www.myserver.com/example/greeting.php is
first opened, the if condition in line 2 will evaluate to false because there is
no value yet in $_POST[ 'user_name' ]. Hence, the PHP interpreter will
process lines 6 through 15, which create the text for an HTML file that dis-
plays the form shown in Figure 11.1(b). This is then displayed at the client
side by the Web browser.

6. Line 8 shows one way of creating long text strings in an HTML file. We will
discuss other ways to specify strings later in this section. All text between an
opening <<<_HTML_anda closing _HTML_; is printed into the HTML file as
is. The closing _HTML_; must be alone on a separate line. Thus, the text
added to the HTML file sent to the client will be the text between lines 9
and 13. This includes HTML tags to create the form shown in Figure 11.1(b).

7. PHP variable names start with a $ sign and can include characters, num-
bers, and the underscore character _. The PHP auto-global (predefined)
variable $_SERVER (line 9) is an array that includes information about the
local server. The element $_SERVER[ 'PHP_SELF' ] in the array is the path
name of the PHP file currently being executed on the server. Thus, the action
attribute of the form tag (line 9) instructs the PHP interpreter to reprocess
the same file, once the form parameters are entered by the user.

8. Once the user types the name John Smith in the text box and clicks on the
SUBMIT NAME button (Figure 11.1(c)), program segment P1 is repro-
cessed. This time, $_PoST['user_name'] will include the string
"John Smith", so lines 3 and 4 will now be placed in the HTML file sent to
the client, which displays the message in Figure 11.1(d).

As we can see from this example, a PHP program can create two different HTML
commands depending on whether the user just started or whether they had already
submitted their name through the form. In general, a PHP program can create
numerous variations of HTML text in an HTML file at the server depending on the
particular conditional paths taken in the program. Hence, the HTML sent to the
client will be different depending on the interaction with the user. This is one way
in which PHP is used to create dynamic Web pages.

11.2 Overview of Basic Features of PHP

In this section we give an overview of a few of the features of PHP that are useful in
creating interactive HTML pages. Section 11.3 will focus on how PHP programs
can access databases for querying and updating. We cannot give a comprehensive
