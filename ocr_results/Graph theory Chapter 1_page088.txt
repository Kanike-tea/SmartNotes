1.10 Hamilton cycles and Hamilton paths

Let G be a connected graph. If there is a cycle in G that contains all the vertices of G, then that
cycle is called a Hamilton cycle in G.

A Hamilton cycle (when it exists) in a graph of n vertices consists of exactly n edges.
Because, a cycle with n vertices has n edges.**

By definition, a Hamilton cycle (when it exists) in a graph G must include all vertices in G.
This does not mean that it should include all edges of G.

A graph that contains a Hamiton cycle is called a Hamilton graph (or Hamiltonian graph).

For example, in the graph shown in Figure 1.127, the cycle shown in thick lines is a Ha-
multon cycle. (Observe that this cycle does not include the edge BD). The graph is therefore a

familton graph.

A path (if any) in a connected graph which includes every vertex (but not necessarily every
€) of the graph is called a Hamilton path (or Hamiltonian path) in the graph.
For example, in the graph shown in Figure 1.128, the path shown in thick lines is a Hamilton

In the graph shown in Figure 1.129, the path ABCFEDGHI is a Hamilton path. In Example
low we show that this graph does not contain a Hamilton cycle.
