PREFACE

Increasingly, embedded systems developers and system-on-chip designers select specific
microprocessor cores and a family of tools, libraries, and off-the-shelf components to
quickly develop new microprocessor-based products. A major player in this industry is
ARM. Over the last 10 years, the ARM architecture has become the most pervasive 32-bit
architecture in the world, with more than 2 billion ARM-based processors shipped at the
time of this writing. ARM processors are embedded in products ranging from cell/mobile
phones to automotive braking systems. A worldwide community of ARM partners and
third-party vendors has developed among semiconductor and product design companies,
including hardware engineers, system designers, and software developers. To date, no book
has directly addressed their need to develop the system and software for an ARM-based
embedded design. This text fills that gap.

Our goal has been to describe the operation of the ARM core from a product developer’s
perspective with a clear emphasis on software. Because we have written this book specifically
for engineers who are experienced with embedded systems development but who may be
unfamiliar with the ARM architecture, we have assumed no previous ARM experience.

To help our readers become productive as quickly as possible, we have included a suite
of ARM software examples that can be integrated into commercial products or used as
templates for the quick creation of productive software. The examples are numbered so
that readers can easily locate the source code on the publisher’s Web site. The examples are
also valuable to people with ARM design experience who want to make the most efficient
use of an ARM-based embedded system.

ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK

‘The book begins by briefly noting the ARM processor design philosophy and discussing how
and why it differs from the traditional RISC philosophy. The first chapter also introduces a
simple embedded system based on the ARM processor.

Chapter 2 digs more deeply into the hardware, focusing on the ARM processor core and
presenting an overview of the ARM cores currently in the marketplace.

The ARM and Thumb instruction sets are the focus of Chapters 3 and 4, respectively,
and form the fundamental basis for the rest of the book. Explanations of key instructions
include complete examples, so these chapters also serve as a tutorial on the instruction sets.

Chapters 5 and 6 demonstrate how to write efficient code with scores of example that we
have developed while working with ARM customers. Chapter 5 teaches proven techniques
