Figure 7.6 Control sequence for execution of the instruction Add (R3),R1

Step1--> The instruction-fetch operation is initiated by loading contents of PC
into MAR & sending a Read request to memory. The Select signal is set to
Select4, which causes the Mux to select constant 4. Thisvalue is added to
operand at input B (PC“s content), and the result is stored in Z.
Step2--> Updated value in Z is moved to PC. This completes the PC increment
operation and PC will now point to next instruction.
Step3--> Fetched instruction is moved into MDR and then to IR. The step 1
through 3constitutes the Fetch Phase.
At the beginning of step 4, the instruction decoder interprets the contents of
the IR. This enables the control circuitry to activate the control-signals for steps
4 through 7.

The step 4 through 7 constitutes the Execution Phase.
Step4--> Contents of R3 are loaded into MAR & a memory read signal is issued.
Step5--> Contents of Rl are transferred to Y to prepare for addition.
Step6--> When Read operation is completed, memory-operand is available in MDR,
Step7--> Sum is stored in Z, then transferred to R1.The End signal causes a new
instruction fetch cycle to begin by returning to step1.

Pipelining:
Basic Concepts:
The speed of execution of programs is influenced by many factors.

One way to improve performance is to use faster circuit technology to build the
processor and the main memory. Another possibility is to arrange the hardware so that
more than one operation can be performed at the same time. In this way, the number
of operations performed per second is increased even though the elapsed time needed
to perform any one operation is not changed.

Pipelining is a particularly effective way of organizing concurrent activity in a
computer system.

The technique of decomposing a sequential process into sub-operations, with each sub-
operation being executed in a dedicated segment .

pipelining is commonly known as an assembly-line operation.
