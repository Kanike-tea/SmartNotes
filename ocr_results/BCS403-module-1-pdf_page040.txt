Figure 3.3(a): Preliminary design of entity types for the COMPANY database. Some of the shown
attributes will be refined into relationships.

3.4 Relationship Types, Relationship Sets, Roles, and Structural Constraints

There are several implicit relationships among the various entity types. Whenever an attribute of one
entity type refers to another entity type, some relationship exists. For example
= The attribute Manager of DEPARTMENT refers to an employee who manages the department
« The attribute Controlling department of PROJECT refers to the department that controls the
project
«The attribute Supervisor of EMPLOYEE refers to another employee -the one who supervises this
employee
= The attribute Department of EMPLOYEE refers to the department for which the employee works

In the ER model, these references should not be represented as attributes but as relationships
