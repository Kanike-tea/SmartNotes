Chapter 30 Database Security

common that the Web application itself is the user rather than a duly authorized
individual. This gives rise to a situation where the DBMS’s access control mecha-
nisms are bypassed and the database becomes just a relational data store to the sys-
tem. In such environments, vulnerabilities like SQL injection (which we cover in
depth in Section 30.4) become significantly more dangerous bacause it may lead to
a total data breach rather than being limited to data that a particular account is
authorized to access.

To protect against data breaches in these systems, a first requirement is a compre-
hensive information security policy that goes beyond the technical access control
mechanisms found in mainstream DBMSs. Such a policy must protect not only
traditional data, but also processes, knowledge, and experience.

A second related requirement is the support for content-based access control.
Content-based access control allows one to express access control policies that
take the protection object content into account. In order to support content-based
access control, access control policies must allow inclusion of conditions based on
the object content.

A third requirement is related to the heterogeneity of subjects, which requires
access control policies based on user characteristics and qualifications rather than
on specific and individual characteristics (for example, user Ids). A possible solu-
tion that will allow better accounting of user profiles in the formulation of access
control policies, is to support the notion of credentials. A credential is a set of prop-
erties concerning a user that are relevant for security purposes (for example, age or
position or role within an organization). For instance, by using credentials, one can
simply formulate policies such as Only permanent staff with five or more years of
service can access documents related to the internals of the system.

XML is expected to play a key role in access control for e-commerce applications®
because XML is becoming the common representation language for document
interchange over the Web, and is also becoming the language for e-commerce.
Thus, on the one hand, there is the need to make XML representations secure by
providing access control mechanisms specifically tailored to the protection of
XML documents. On the other hand, access control information (that is, access
control policies and user credentials) can be expressed using XML itself. The
Directory Services Markup Language (DSML) is a representation of directory
service information in XML syntax. It provides a foundation for a standard for
communicating with the directory services that will be responsible for providing
and authenticating user credentials. The uniform presentation of both protection
objects and access control policies can be applied to policies and credentials them-
selves. For instance, some credential properties (such as the user name) may be
accessible to everyone, whereas other properties may be visible only to a restricted
class of users. Additionally, the use of an XML-based language for specifying cre-
dentials and access control policies facilitates secure credential submission and
export of access control policies.
