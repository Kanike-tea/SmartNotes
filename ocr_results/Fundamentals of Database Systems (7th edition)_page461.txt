13.2 XML Hierarchical (Tree) Data Model

used in the same manner as is customary in database terminology, but rather as it is used
in document description languages such as HTML and SGML.* Attributes in XML
provide additional information that describes elements, as we will see. There are addi-
tional concepts in XML, such as entities, identifiers, and references, but first we concen-
trate on describing elements and attributes to show the essence of the XML model.

Figure 13.3 shows an example of an XML element called <Projects>. As in HTML,
elements are identified in a document by their start tag and end tag. The tag names
are enclosed between angled brackets < ... >, and end tags are further identified by
aslash, </... >

Complex elements are constructed from other elements hierarchically, whereas
simple elements contain data values. A major difference between XML and HTML
is that XML tag names are defined to describe the meaning of the data elements in
the document rather than to describe how the text is to be displayed. This makes it
possible to process the data elements in the XML document automatically by com-
puter programs. Also, the XML tag (element) names can be defined in another doc-
ument, known as the schema document, to give a semantic meaning to the tag
names that can be exchanged among multiple programs and users. In HTML, all
tag names are predefined and fixed; that is why they are not extendible.

It is straightforward to see the correspondence between the XML textual representa-
tion shown in Figure 13.3 and the tree structure shown in Figure 13.1. In the tree
representation, internal nodes represent complex elements, whereas leaf nodes rep-
resent simple elements. That is why the XML model is called a tree model or a
hierarchical model. In Figure 13.3, the simple elements are the ones with the tag
names <Name>, <Number>, <Location>, <Dept_no>, <Ssn>, <Last_name>, <First_name>,
and <Hours>. The complex elements are the ones with the tag names <Projects>,
<Project>, and <Worker>. In general, there is no limit on the levels of nesting of elements.

It is possible to characterize three main types of XML documents:

= Data-centric XML documents. These documents have many small data
items that follow a specific structure and hence may be extracted from a
structured database. They are formatted as XML documents in order to
exchange them over the Web. These usually follow a predefined schema that
defines the tag names.

= Document-centric XML documents. These are documents with large
amounts of text, such as news articles or books. There are few or no struc-
tured data elements in these documents.

= Hybrid XML documents. These documents may have parts that contain
structured data and other parts that are predominantly textual or unstruc-
tured. They may or may not have a predefined schema.

4SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a more general language for describing documents
and provides capabilities for specifying new tags. However, it is more complex than HTML and XML.

5The left and right angled bracket characters (< and >) are reserved characters, as are the ampersand
(&), apostrophe (’), and single quotation mark (’). To include them within the text of a document, they
must be encoded with escapes as &lt, &gt;, &amp;, &apos;, and &quot;, respectively.
