Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

that they can be extracted by a precompiler and processed by the DBMS. A low-
level or procedural DML must be embedded in a general-purpose programming
language. This type of DML typically retrieves individual records or objects from
the database and processes each separately. Therefore, it needs to use programming
language constructs, such as looping, to retrieve and process each record from a set
of records. Low-level DMLs are also called record-at-a-time DMLs because of this
property. High-level DMLs, such as SQL, can specify and retrieve many records in
a single DML statement; therefore, they are called set-at-a-time or set-oriented
DMLs. A query in a high-level DML often specifies which data to retrieve rather
than how to retrieve it; therefore, such languages are also called declarative.

Whenever DML commands, whether high level or low level, are embedded in a
general-purpose programming language, that language is called the host language
and the DML is called the data sublanguage.'” On the other hand, a high-level
DML used in a standalone interactive manner is called a query language. In gen-
eral, both retrieval and update commands of a high-level DML may be used inter-
actively and are hence considered part of the query language.’

Casual end users typically use a high-level query language to specify their requests,
whereas programmers use the DML in its embedded form. For naive and paramet-
ric users, there usually are user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the data-
base; these can also be used by casual users or others who do not want to learn the
details of a high-level query language. We discuss these types of interfaces next.

2.3.2 DBMS Interfaces
User-triendly interfaces provided by a DBMS may include the following:

Menu-based Interfaces for Web Clients or Browsing. These interfaces pres-
ent the user with lists of options (called menus) that lead the user through the for-
mulation of a request. Menus do away with the need to memorize the specific
commands and syntax of a query language; rather, the query is composed step-by-
step by picking options from a menu that is displayed by the system. Pull-down
menus are a very popular technique in Web-based user interfaces. They are also
often used in browsing interfaces, which allow a user to look through the contents
of a database in an exploratory and unstructured manner.

Apps for Mobile Devices. These interfaces present mobile users with access to
their data. For example, banking, reservations, and insurance companies, among
many others, provide apps that allow users to access their data through a mobile
phone or mobile device. The apps have built-in programmed interfaces that typically

'ln abject databases, the host and data sublanguages typically form one integrated language—for
example, C++ with some extensions to support database functionality. Some relational systems also
provide integrated languages—for example, Oracle's PL/SQL.

'T According to the English meaning of the word query, it should really be used to describe retrievals
only, not updates.
