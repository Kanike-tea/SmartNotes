Suppose we assign a colour @ to all vertices in V; and a different colour £ to all Vertices in
This will make a proper colouring of V. Hence G is 2-chromatic. .

Uf A(G) is the maximum of the degrees of the vertices of a connected 8raph G

x(G) < 1+ AG). fi
> Suppose G contains n = 2 vertices. Then the degrees of both the vertices is 1, so that
A(G) = 1, and y(G) = 2. Hence

XG =1+4@)

Thus, the required inequality (i) is verified for n = 2.

Assume that the inequality (i) is true for all connected graphs with k vertices. Consider g
Connected graph G’ with k + 1 vertices. If we remove any vertex v from G’ then the Tesulting
graph H will have k vertices and A(H) < AG’).* Since H has k vertices, the inequality (i)
holds for H (by the assumption made). Therefore, y(H) < 1+ A(H). Since A(H) < A(G’), this
yields

X(H) <1+A(G’)

Now, a proper colouring of G’ can be achieved b’

The colour to be assigned to v can be one of the colours already assigned to a vertex i?
