that model implicitly. For example, in the Entity-Relationship model in Chapter 3,
a relationship must involve at least two entities. Rules that pertain to a specific data
model are called inherent rules of the data model.

1.6.9 Permitting Inferencing and Actions
Using Rules and Triggers

Some database systems provide capabilities for defining deduction rules for infer-
encing new information from the stored database facts. Such systems are called
deductive database systems. For example, there may be complex rules in the mini-
world application for determining when a student is on probation. These can be
specified declaratively as rules, which when compiled and maintained by the DBMS
can determine all students on probation. In a traditional DBMS, an explicit proce-
dural program code would have to be written to support such applications. But if
the miniworld rules change, it is generally more convenient to change the declared
deduction rules than to recode procedural programs. In today’s relational database
systems, it is possible to associate triggers with tables. A trigger is a form of a rule
activated by updates to the table, which results in performing some additional oper-
ations to some other tables, sending messages, and so on. More involved proce-
dures to enforce rules are popularly called stored procedures; they become a part of
the overall database definition and are invoked appropriately when certain condi-
tions are met. More powerful functionality is provided by active database systems,
which provide active rules that can automatically initiate actions when certain
events and conditions occur (see Chapter 26 for introductions to active databases in
Section 26.1 and deductive databases in Section 26.5).

1.6.10 Additional Implications of Using
the Database Approach

This section discusses a few additional implications of using the database approach
that can benefit most organizations.

Potential for Enforcing Standards. The database approach permits the DBA to
define and enforce standards among database users in a large organization. This facil-
itates communication and cooperation among various departments, projects, and
users within the organization. Standards can be defined for names and formats of
data elements, display formats, report structures, terminology, and so on. The DBA
can enforce standards in a centralized database environment more easily than in an
environment where each user group has control of its own data files and software.

Reduced Application Development Time. A prime selling feature of the data-
base approach is that developing a new application—such as the retrieval of certain
data from the database for printing a new report—takes very little time. Designing
and implementing a large multiuser database from scratch may take more time
than writing a single specialized file application. However, once a database is up
and running, substantially less time is generally required to create new applications
