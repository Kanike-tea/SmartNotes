Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

relation schema R = {Aj, Ap, ... , An}.” We do not imply that we will actually store
the database as a single universal table; we use this concept only in developing the

formal theory of data dependencies.*

Definition. A functional dependency, denoted by X > Y, between two sets of
attributes X and Y that are subsets of R specifies a constraint on the possible
tuples that can form a relation state r of R. The constraint is that, for any two
tuples f; and f, in r that have f,[X] = f2[X], they must also have t[Y] = H[Y].

This means that the values of the Y component of a tuple in r depend on, or are deter-
mined by, the values of the X component; alternatively, the values of the X component
of a tuple uniquely (or functionally) determine the values of the Y component. We
also say that there is a functional dependency from X to Y, or that Y is functionally
dependent on X. The abbreviation for functional dependency is FD or f.d. The set of
attributes X is called the left-hand side of the FD, and Y is called the right-hand side.

Thus, X functionally determines Y in a relation schema R if, and only if, whenever
two tuples of r(R) agree on their X-value, they must necessarily agree on their

Y-value. Note the following:

= Ifa constraint on R states that there cannot be more than one tuple with a
given X-value in any relation instance r(R)—that is, X is a candidate key of
R—this implies that X > Y for any subset of attributes Y of R (because the
key constraint implies that no two tuples in any legal state r(R) will have the

same value of X). If X is a candidate key of R, then X > R.
= IfX— YinR, this does not say whether or not Y— Xin R.

A functional dependency is a property of the semantics or meaning of the
attributes. The database designers will use their understanding of the semantics of the
attributes of R—that is, how they relate to one another—to specify the functional
dependencies that should hold on ail relation states (extensions) r of R. Relation
extensions r(R) that satisfy the functional dependency constraints are called legal
relation states (or legal extensions) of R. Hence, the main use of functional depen-
dencies is to describe further a relation schema R by specifying constraints on its
attributes that must hold at all times. Certain FDs can be specified without referring
to a specific relation, but as a property of those attributes given their commonly
understood meaning. For example, {State, Driver_license_number} > Ssn should
normally hold for any adult in the United States and hence should hold whenever
these attributes appear in a relation.? It is also possible that certain functional

7This concept of a universal relation is important when we discuss the algorithms for relational database

design in Chapter 15.

8This assumption implies that every attribute in the database should have a distinct name. In Chapter 5
we prefixed attribute names by relation names to achieve uniqueness whenever attributes in distinct

relations had the same name.

®Note that there are databases, such as those of credit card agencies or police departments, where this
functional dependency may not hold because of fraudulent records resulting from the same driver's

license number being used by two or more different individuals.
