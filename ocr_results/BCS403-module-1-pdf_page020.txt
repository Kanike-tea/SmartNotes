design in a high-level data model.

In a DBMS based on the three-schema architecture, each user group refers to its own external
schema. Hence, the DBMS must transform a request specified on an external schema into a request
against the conceptual schema, and then into a request on the internal schema for processing over
the stored database. If the request is a database retrieval, the data extracted

from the stored database must be reformatted to match the user’s external view.

The processes of transforming requests and results between levels are called mappings.
