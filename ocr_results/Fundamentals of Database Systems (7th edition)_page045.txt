1.4 Actors on the Scene

1.4 Actors on the Scene

For a small personal database, such as the list of addresses discussed in Section 1.1,
one person typically defines, constructs, and manipulates the database, and there is
no sharing. However, in large organizations, many people are involved in the
design, use, and maintenance of a large database with hundreds or thousands of
users. In this section we identify the people whose jobs involve the day-to-day use
of a large database; we call them the actors on the scene. In Section 1.5 we consider
people who may be called workers behind the scene—those who work to maintain
the database system environment but who are not actively interested in the data-
base contents as part of their daily job.

1.4.1 Database Administrators

In any organization where many people use the same resources, there is a need for
achief administrator to oversee and manage these resources. In a database environ-
ment, the primary resource is the database itself, and the secondary resource is the
DBMS and related software. Administering these resources is the responsibility of
the database administrator (DBA). The DBA is responsible for authorizing access
to the database, coordinating and monitoring its use, and acquiring software and
hardware resources as needed. The DBA is accountable for problems such as secu-
rity breaches and poor system response time. In large organizations, the DBA is
assisted by a staff that carries out these functions.

1.4.2 Database Designers

Database designers are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the data-
base and for choosing appropriate structures to represent and store this data. These
tasks are mostly undertaken before the database is actually implemented and popu-
lated with data. It is the responsibility of database designers to communicate with
all prospective database users in order to understand their requirements and to cre-
ate a design that meets these requirements. In many cases, the designers are on the
staff of the DBA and may be assigned other staff responsibilities after the database
design is completed. Database designers typically interact with each potential group
of users and develop views of the database that meet the data and processing
requirements of these groups. Each view is then analyzed and integrated with the
views of other user groups. The final database design must be capable of supporting
the requirements of all user groups.

1.4.3 End Users

End users are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying,
updating, and generating reports; the database primarily exists for their use. There
are several categories of end users:

= Casual end users occasionally access the database, but they may need differ-
ent information each time. They use a sophisticated database query interface
