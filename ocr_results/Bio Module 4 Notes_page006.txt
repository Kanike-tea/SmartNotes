Uses of Sonars
Sonars are commonly used for a variety of purposes, including:

e Naval applications: Sonars are used by naval vessels to detect and locate other ships,
submarines, and underwater obstacles, allowing them to navigate safely and avoid
potential collisions.

e Fishery: Sonars are used in the fishing industry to locate schools of fish and determine
the depth of the water, allowing fishermen to more efficiently target their catch.

e Oceanography: Sonars are used in oceanography to study the physical and biological
properties of the ocean, including the structure of the ocean floor, the movement of
currents, and the distribution of marine life.

e Environmental monitoring: Sonars are used to monitor the health of marine ecosystems,
track the migration patterns of whales and other marine mammals, and assess_ the impact
of human activities on the ocean environment.

e Sonar technology works by emitting a series of sound pulses and listening for the echoes
that bounce back from underwater objects. The time it takes for the echoes to return is
used to calculate the distance to the objects, and the frequency and pattern of the echoes
are used to determine their size and shape.

Working Principle of Sonars
The working principle of sonar technology is based on the reflection of sound waves.
Here's how it works:

e Transmitter: A sonar system consists of a transmitter that produces and emits a series of
sound pulses into the water. These sound pulses are typically in the form of high-
frequency, low-power acoustic signals, known as "ping."
