carbon dioxide as a feedstock, bionic leaf systems can potentially help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and combat climate change.

: Sustainable Chemical Production: Bionic leaf systems can be utilized for sustainable
chemical production. By utilizing carbon dioxide and renewable energy, these systems can
produce a wide range of valuable chemicals, such as fertilizers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals.

: Agriculture and Food Production: By utilizing sunlight and carbon dioxide, bionic leaf
systems can generate oxygen and energy-rich compounds that can enhance plant growth and
improve crop yields. This technology can potentially contribute to sustainable agriculture
practices and help address global food security challenges.

: Remote and Off-Grid Areas: Bionic leaf systems can provide a decentralized and off-
grid energy solution for remote or underdeveloped areas. By harnessing solar energy and
producing clean fuels, these systems can offer sustainable power sources for communities
without access to conventional energy infrastructure, enabling them to meet their energy needs
and improve their quality of life.

: Environmental Remediation: By utilizing the energy generated from sunlight, bionic
leaf systems can power processes that remove pollutants or contaminants from air, water, or
soil, contributing to the restoration and preservation of ecosystems.

2. Discuss the application of Artificial Intelligence in the diagnosis of diseases.

Ans. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or computer programs to
perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and
decision-making. In the healthcare field, AI plays a major role in disease diagnosis by helping
doctors analyze large volumes of medical data quickly and accurately. The main goal of using
AT in disease diagnosis is to detect illnesses at an early stage, reduce human error, and support
doctors in making better clinical decisions.

There are several types of AI techniques used in healthcare. Machine Learning (ML) is one of
the most common types, where algorithms learn patterns from data and make predictions—for
example, predicting the risk of diabetes from a patient's medical history. Deep Learning (DL),
a type of ML that uses artificial neural networks, is especially effective in analyzing medical
images like X-rays and MRIs to detect tumors or fractures. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
helps in understanding and processing written or spoken medical language. It is used to extract
useful information from clinical notes, prescriptions, and health records. Another important
technique is computer vision, which allows AI to "see" and interpret visual data, such as

identifying skin diseases from photographs or detecting abnormalities in X-rays.

AI is being applied in various areas of medicine. In cancer detection, AI models can identify
breast cancer or skin cancer by analyzing images, sometimes even more accurately than human
doctors. In cardiology, AI tools can interpret ECG readings and help predict heart attacks. In
ophthalmology, AI systems detect diabetic retinopathy from retina scans, which helps in
preventing blindness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI models were used to diagnose
