The diagrammatic representation of this addressing mode is as shown in the fig.

Memory

Indirect Addressing Mode

e. INDEX ADDRESSING MODE

In this addressing mode, the effective address of an operand is computed by adding constant

value with the contents of Index Register and any one of the General Purpose Register namely

Roto Rn-1 can be used as the Index Register. The constant valuejis directly specified in the

instruction.

The symbolic representations of this mode are as follows

1. X (Ri) where Xis the Constant value and Rj is the GPR.
It-can be represented as
EA of an operand = X + (Ri)
2. (Ri , Ry) Where Ri and Rj are the General Purpose Registers used to store
addresses of an operand and constant value respectively. It can be represented as
The EA of an operand is given by
EA = (Ri) + (Rj)
3. X (Ri, Rj) Where Xais the constant value and Ri and Rj are the General Purpose Registers
used to store the addresses of the operands.It can be represented as
The EA of an operand is given by
EA = (Ri) + (Rj) +X

There are two types of Index Addressing Modes

i) Offset is given as constant.
ii) Offset is in Index Register.
