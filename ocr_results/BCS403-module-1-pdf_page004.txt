Database Management System [BCS403]

Defining a UNIVERSITY database
= Specify the structure of the records of each file - data elements to be stored in each
record.For example: each STUDENT record includes data to represent the student’s
Name, Student_number, Class Major. Similarly each COURSE record includes data to
represent the Course_name, Course_number, Credit_hours, and Department.
= Specify a data type for each data element within a record. For example: student’s Name

isa string of alphabetic charactersStudent_number is an integer.

Constructing the UNIVERSITY database
= To construct the UNIVERSITY database, we store data to represent.each student,course,
section, grade report, and prerequisite as a record in the appropriate file.
= Records in the various files may be related. For example, the record forSmith in the
STUDENT file is related to two records in the GRADE_REPORT file thatspecify Smith’s
grades in two sections. Similarly, each record inthe PREREQUISITEfile relates two
course records: one representing the course and the other representing

the prerequisite.

Manipulating a UNIVERSITY database
Database manipulation involves querying and updating.
Examples of queries are asfollows:
« Retrieve the transcript—a list of all courses and grades—of ‘Smith’
« List the names of students who took the section of the ‘Database’ course offered in fall
2008 and their grades in that section
= List the prerequisites of the ‘Database’ course
Examples of updates include the following:
= Change the class of ‘Smith’ to sophomore
= Create a new section for the ‘Database’ course for this semester

= Enter a grade of ‘A’ for ‘Smith’ in the ‘Database’ section of last semester

These informal queries and updates must be specified precisely in the query language

of the DBMS before they can be processed.
