Binary Tree Traversals

Traversing a tree is visiting each node in the tree exactly once.

When a node is visited, some operation (such as outputting its data field) is performed on it.
A full traversal produces a linear order for the nodes in a tree.

When traversing a tree each node and its subtrees must be treated in the same fashion.
Based on this there are three types of traversals inorder, preorder and postorder traversals.
