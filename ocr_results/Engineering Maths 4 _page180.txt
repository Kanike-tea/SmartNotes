Comparing (3) and (4) we must have f(y) = 0 and g(x) =0

Putting x =z and y=0 weget f(z) = {2 +2]

Remark : Compare this problem with Problem - 17 worked earlier wherein, starting from
W we first obtained f(z) by Milne Thompson method and later got > by separating
f(Z) into real and imaginary parts.

‘It is important to note that if we have to construct f(z) given u or v then

Milne-Thompson method is easier (Type-2). However if we have to find f(z) by obtaining v
given u (or u given v) then the procedure as in Type-3 has to be employed.
