Proof: Consider any subset W of k vertices in V;.'If the degree ie every Vertex in y, iste,
than or equal to m for some positive integer m (as per the ree * Siven), then S
least m edges incident on each vertex in Vi. There a total of al east mk edges are: @
on k vertices in W. Each of these mk edges is incident on some vertex in V2. Thus, :
at least mk edges from W to V2. Since the degree of every vertex in V2 18 at most m (ag Pert
condition given), at most m edges go to any vertex in V2. Therefore, if there are i’ Vettogs:
V> that are the end vertices of edges from W, then the number of edges from W to Voisg
mk’. Accordingly, the number of edges from W to V2 is at least mk and at most m¥’, AS such

mk<mk, or Kk 2k.

Thus, under the given condition, any subset W of k vertices in Vj is collectively adjacen
to ’ > k vertices in V2. Therefore, by Hall’s: Theorem (Theorem 1), there exists a comple:
matching from V; to V2. This completes the proof of the theorem.

By using Theorem 2, show that in the bipartite graph shown in Figure 4.64 ther
exists a complete matching from V, to V3.
> By examining the graph, we note that:

degree of every vertex in V; > 2-> degree of every vertex in V>.

Therefore, there is a complete matching from Vj to V>.* 1

Five students s 59, 53, 54, 85 are members of three committees cy, cz and c;. Te
committee c, has s3 and s4 as members, the commitiee C2 has s}, 53, 85 as members, and te
committee c3 has s2 and ss as members. Each committee is to select a student representatt i
Can a selection be made in such a way that each committee has a distinct representative?
