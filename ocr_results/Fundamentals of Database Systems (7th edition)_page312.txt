Houston.

List the last names of all department managers who have no dependents.

8.17. Consider the AIRLINE relational database schema shown in Figure 5.8, which
was described in Exercise 5.12. Specify the following queries in relational
algebra:

a.

d.

e.

For each flight, list the flight number, the departure airport for the first
leg of the flight, and the arrival airport for the last leg of the flight.

. List the flight numbers and weekdays of all flights or flight legs that depart

from Houston Intercontinental Airport (airport code ‘iah’) and arrive in
Los Angeles International Airport (airport code ‘lax’).

. List the flight number, departure airport code, scheduled departure time,

arrival airport code, scheduled arrival time, and weekdays of all flights or
flight legs that depart from some airport in the city of Houston and arrive
at some airport in the city of Los Angeles.

List all fare information for flight number ‘co197’.

Retrieve the number of available seats for flight number ‘col97’ on
*2009-10-09°.

. Consider the LIBRARY relational database schema shown in Figure 8.14, which

is used to keep track of books, borrowers, and book loans. Referential integrity
constraints are shown as directed arcs in Figure 8.14, as in the notation of Fig-

Retrieve the names, addresses, and number of books checked out for all
borrowers who have more than five books checked out.

. For each book authored (or coauthored) by Stephen King, retrieve the
