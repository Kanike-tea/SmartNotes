27.1 Information Retrieval (IR) Concepts

desktop search engines (for example, Google Desktop, OS X Spotlight), for retriev-
ing files, folders, and different kinds of entities stored on the computer. There are
other systems that use peer-to-peer technology, such as the BitTorrent protocol,
which allows sharing of music in the form of audio files, as well as specialized search
engines for audio, such as Lycos and Yahoo! audio search.

27.1.2 Databases and IR Systems: A Comparison

Within the computer science discipline, databases and IR systems are closely related
fields. Databases deal with structured information retrieval through well-defined
formal languages for representation and manipulation based on the theoretically
founded data models. Efficient algorithms have been developed for operators that
allow rapid execution of complex queries. IR, on the other hand, deals with unstruc-
tured search with possibly vague query or search semantics and without a well-
defined logical schematic representation. Some of the key differences between
databases and IR systems are listed in Table 27.1.

Whereas databases have fixed schemas defined in some data model such as the rela-
tional model, an IR system has no fixed data model; it views data or documents
according to some scheme, such as the vector space model, to aid in query process-
ing (see Section 27.2). Databases using the relational model employ SQL for queries
and transactions. The queries are mapped into relational algebra operations and
search algorithms (see Chapter 19) and return a new relation (table) as the query
result, providing an exact answer to the query for the current state of the database.
In IR systems, there is no fixed language for defining the structure (schema) of the
document or for operating on the document—queries tend to be a set of query
terms (keywords) or a free-form natural language phrase. An IR query result isa list
of document id’s, or some pieces of text or multimedia objects (images, videos, and
so on), or a list of links to Web pages.

The result of a database query is an exact answer; if no matching records (tuples)
are found in the relation, the result is empty (null). On the other hand, the answer

= Structured data = Unstructured data

= Schema driven = No fixed schema; various data models

= Relational (or object, hierarchical, and (e.g., vector space model)
network) model is predominant = Free-form query models

= Structured query model = Rich data operations

= Rich metadata operations = Search request returns list or pointers to

= Query returns data documents

= Results are based on exact matching (always = Results are based on approximate matching
correct) and measures of effectiveness (may be

imprecise and ranked)
