8. Prove that the complete bipartite graph K3,3 is Hamiltonian but not Eulerian.
9, Prove that, if G is a bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices, then G is non-Hamiltonian

10. If the degree of each vertex in a simple graph is at least (n — 1)/2, where n is the number gf
vertices, show that the graph has a Hamilton path.

11. Show that the complete graph K,, contains 5(n — 1)! different Hamilton cycles.

12. In the Worked Example 11, if the number of members is 9, find the possible seating arrangement
where every member has different neighbours at each lunch.
