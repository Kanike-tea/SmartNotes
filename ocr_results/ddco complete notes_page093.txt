b. DIRECT ADDRESSING

It is also called as Absolute Addressing Mode. In this addressing mode operands are stored in the

memory locations. The name of the memory location is directly specified in the instruction.

Ex: MOVE LOCA, Ri: Where LOCA is the memory location and R1 is the Register.

This instruction transfers 32 bits of data from memory location X into the General Purpose

Register R1.

Direct Addressing Mode

@ IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING

In this Addressing Mode operands are directly specified inthe instruction. The source field is used

to represent the operands. The operands are represented by #(hash) sign.

Ex: MOVE #23, RO

Immediate Addressing Mode

d. INDIRECT ADDRESSING

In this Addressing Mode effective address of an operand is stored in the memory location or

General Purpose Register.

The memory locations or GPRs are used as the memory pointers.
Memory pointer: It stores the address of the memory location.
There are two types Indirect Addressing

i Indirect through GPRs

ii) Indirect through memory location
