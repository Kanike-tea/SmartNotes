Role of Cache Memory

Each pipeline stage is expected to complete in one clock cycle.
The clock period should be long enough to let the slowest pipeline stage to complete.
Faster stages can only wait for the slowest one to complete.

Since main memory is very slow compared to the execution, if each instruction needs to be fetched from
main memory, pipeline is almost useless.

Fortunately, we have cache

The previous pipeline is said to have been stalled for two clock cycles.
Any condition that causes a pipeline to stall is called a hazard.

Data hazard — any condition in which either the source or the destination operands of an instruction are
not available at the time expected in the pipeline. So some operation has to be delayed, and the pipeline
stalls.

Instruction (control) hazard — a delay in the availability of an instruction causes the pipeline to stall.

Structural hazard — the situation when two instructions require the use of a given hardware resource at the
same time.

Again, pipelining does not result in individual instructions being executed faster; rather, it is the
throughput that increases.

Throughput is measured by the rate at which instruction execution is completed.
Pipeline stall causes degradation in pipeline performance.

We need to identify all hazards that may cause the pipeline to stall and to find ways to minimize their
impact.
