COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

Note : Offset : It is the difference between the starting effective address of the memory location

and the effective address of the operand fetched from memory.
i) Offset is given as constant

Ex: ADD 20(R1), R2
The EA of an operand is given by
EA = 20 + [Ri]

This instruction adds the contents of memory location whose EA is the sum of contents of Ri
with 20 and with the contents of R2 and result is placed im.R2 register. The diagrammatic

representation of this mode is as shown in the fig.

a a i

ii) Offset is in Index Register
Ex: ADD 1000(R1) ,R2 Ru holds the offset address of an operand.

The EA of an operand is given by
EA = 1000 + [Ri]

This instruction adds the data from the memory location whose address is given by [1000 +

[R1] with the contents of R2 and result is placed in R2 register.

The diagrammatic representation of this mode is as shown in the fig.
