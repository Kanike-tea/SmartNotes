related to recovery in distributed databases. Elections in distributed systems are
discussed in Garcia-Molina (1982). Lamport (1978) discusses problems with gener-
ating unique timestamps in a distributed system. Rahimi and Haug (2007) discuss a
more flexible way to construct query critical metadata for P2P databases. Ouzzani
and Bouguettaya (2004) outline fundamental problems in distributed query pro-
cessing over Web-based data sources.

A concurrency control technique for replicated data that is based on voting is pre-
sented by Thomas (1979). Gifford (1979) proposes the use of weighted voting, and
Paris (1986) describes a method called voting with witnesses. Jajodia and Mutchler
(1990) discuss dynamic voting. A technique called available copy is proposed by
Bernstein and Goodman (1984), and one that uses the idea of a group is presented
in ElAbbadi and Toueg (1988). Other work that discusses replicated data includes
Gladney (1989), Agrawal and ElAbbadi (1990), ElAbbadi and Toueg (1989), Kumar
and Segev (1993), Mukkamala (1989), and Wolfson and Milo (1991). Bassiouni
(1988) discusses optimistic protocols for DDB concurrency control. Garcia-Molina
(1983) and Kumar and Stonebraker (1987) discuss techniques that use the seman-
tics of the transactions. Distributed concurrency control techniques based on lock-
ing and distinguished copies are presented by Menasce et al. (1980) and Minoura
and Wiederhold (1982). Obermark (1982) presents algorithms for distributed
deadlock detection. In more recent work, Vadivelu et al. (2008) propose using
backup mechanism and multilevel security to develop algorithms for improving
concurrency. Madria et al. (2007) propose a mechanism based on a multiversion
two-phase locking scheme and timestamping to address concurrency issues specific
to mobile database systems. Boukerche and Tuck (2001) propose a technique that
allows transactions to be out of order to a limited extent. They attempt to ease the
load on the application developer by exploiting the network environment and pro-
ducing a schedule equivalent to a temporally ordered serial schedule. Han et al.
(2004) propose a deadlock-free and serializable extended Petri net model for Web-
based distributed real-time databases.

A survey of recovery techniques in distributed systems is given by Kohler (1981).
Reed (1983) discusses atomic actions on distributed data. Bhargava (1987) presents
an edited compilation of various approaches and techniques for concurrency and
reliability in distributed systems.

Federated database systems were first defined in McLeod and Heimbigner (1985).
Techniques for schema integration in federated databases are presented by Elmasri
et al. (1986), Batini et al. (1987), Hayne and Ram (1990), and Motro (1987).
Elmagarmid and Helal (1988) and Gamal-Eldin et al. (1988) discuss the update
problem in heterogeneous DDBSs. Heterogeneous distributed database issues are
discussed in Hsiao and Kamel (1989). Sheth and Larson (1990) present an exhaus-
tive survey of federated database management.

Since the late 1980s, multidatabase systems and interoperability have become
important topics. Techniques for dealing with semantic incompatibilities among
multiple databases are examined in DeMichiel (1989), Siegel and Madnick (1991),
Krishnamurthy et al. (1991), and Wang and Madnick (1989). Castano et al. (1998)
