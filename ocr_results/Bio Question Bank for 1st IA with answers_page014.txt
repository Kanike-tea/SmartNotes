2. Transesterification: The purified lipids are mixed with an alcohol, such as methanol, and a catalyst,
such as sodium hydroxide, to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), which are the main
components of biodiesel. This process is known as transesterification.

3. Separation: The reaction mixture is then separated into two layers: the upper layer contains the
FAME (biodiesel) and the lower layer contains the glycerol (byproduct).

4. Washing and drying: The biodiesel is washed with water to remove any residual alcohol and
soap that was formed during the transesterification reaction. The biodiesel is then dried to
remove any remaining moisture.

5. Purification: The biodiesel is further purified to remove any impurities and improve its quality.

6. Final product: The purified biodiesel is then stored and distributed for use as a fuel.

It is important to note that the exact process can vary depending on the specific type of lipid and
the desired quality of the final product. Further research is needed to improve the efficiency and

cost-effectiveness of the biodiesel production process.

10. Explain in detail the properties & function of Vitamins.

Ans. Vitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts for various physiological
functions. They play a crucial role in metabolism, growth, and overall health. Since the body
cannot synthesize most vitamins in sufficient quantities, they must be obtained from food or

supplements.
Vitamins are broadly classified into:

1. Fat-Soluble Vitamins — Stored in the body’s fat tissues and liver (e.g., Vitamins A, D, E, and
K).
2. Water-Soluble Vitamins — Dissolve in water and are not stored in the body; excess amounts are

excreted (e.g., Vitamin C and B-complex vitamins).

Fat-Soluble Vitamins

1. Vitamin A (Retinol, Beta-Carotene)

¢ Properties: Fat-soluble, stable in heat, but destroyed by oxygen and light.
