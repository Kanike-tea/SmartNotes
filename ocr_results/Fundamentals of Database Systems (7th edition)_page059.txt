Selected Bibliography

The October 1991 issue of Communications of the ACM and Kim (1995) include
several articles describing next-generation DBMSs; many of the database features
discussed in the former are now commercially available. The March 1976 issue of
ACM Computing Surveys offers an early introduction to database systems and may
provide a historical perspective for the interested reader. We will include references
to other concepts, systems, and applications introduced in this chapter in the later
text chapters that discuss each topic in more detail.
