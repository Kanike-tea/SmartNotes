Table 4.3 Exception priority levels.

@ The Reset exception is the highest priority and it occurs when power
is applied to the processor. The reset handler initializes the system,
and setting up memory and caches.The reset handler must also set up
the stack pointers for all processor modes.When a reset occurs, it
takes precedence over all other exceptions.
The lowest priority level is shared by two exceptions, the Software
Interrupt and Undefined Instruction exceptions.
As shown in the table Certain exceptions also disable interrupts by
setting the I or F bits in the cpsr
Code should be designed such that there is no exceptions or interrupts
will occur during the first few instructions of the handler.
Data Abort exceptions occur when the memory controller or MMU
indicates that an invalid memory address has been accessed or when
the current code attempts to read or write to memory without the
correct access permissions.When Data Abort occurs, it takes

precedence over all other exceptions except Reset exception.

@ A Fast Interrupt Request (FIQ) exception occurs when an external
peripheral sets the FIQ pin to nFIQ. An FIQ exception is the highest
priority interrupt.The core disables both IRQ and FIQ exceptions on
entry into the FIQ handler. Thus, no external source can interrupt the
processor unless the IRQ and/or FIQ exceptions are reenabled by
software.

@ An _ Interrupt Request_(IRQ) exception occurs when an external
peripheral sets the IRQ pin to nIRQ. An IRQ exception is the second-
highest priority interrupt. The IRQ handler will be entered if neither
an FIQ exception nor Data Abort exception occurs. On entry to the
IRQ handler, the IRQ exceptions are disabled and should remain
disabled until the current interrupt source has been cleared.

@ A Prefetch Abort exception occurs when an attempt to fetch an
instruction results in a memory fault. This exception is raised when
the instruction is in the execute stage of the pipeline and if none of the
higher exceptions have been raised. After enter to the handler, IRQ
