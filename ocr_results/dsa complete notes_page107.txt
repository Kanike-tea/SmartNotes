Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module IV

Structure of the node can be defined as follows

struct node

aw

Struct node *Ichild;
struct

aw

int item; /* Itype represents the data type of the element*/
int key;
}data;

Struct node *rchild;

OT

Typedef struct node TreeNode;

ReCUFSiVe Search Of a binary Searchitree: Return a pointer to the element whose key is k, if there
is no such element, return NULL. We assume that the data field of the element is of type elemenet
and it has two components key and item.

>

Analysis of Search(Both iterative and recursive): If h is the height of the binary search tree, then
we can perform the search using either search in O(h). However, recursive search has an additional
stack space requirement which is O(h).
