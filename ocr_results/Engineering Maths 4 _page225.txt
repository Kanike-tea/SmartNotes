[3.7] Singularity, Pole and Residue

Apoint z = a where f(z) failsto be aes is called a  singuarity ora singular
point of f(z).

A point z = 4 is called an isolated singularity ‘of f@) if there exists’ a
neighbourhood of the point ‘a’ which encloses no other singulariies of f(z).

Examples

1. If f(z) = a then f(z) is notanalytic at z =2 which is

called the singular point of f(z).

z=1, z=-1, z=2 areall called singular points of f(z).
