Some embedded systems use a multitasking operating or control system and must ensure
that a running task does not disrupt the operation of other tasks. The shielding of system
resources and other tasks from unwanted access is called protection and is the subject of
this chapter.

There are two methods to control access to system resources, unprotected and protected.
An unprotected system relies solely on software to protect the system resources. A protected
system relies on both hardware and software to protect the system resources. The choice
of method used by the control system depends on the capability of the processor and the
requirements of the control system.

An unprotected embedded system has no hardware dedicated to enforcing the use
of memory and peripheral devices during operation. In these systems, each task must
cooperate with all other tasks when accessing system resources because any task could
corrupt the state of another task. This cooperative scheme may result in task failure when
one task ignores the access limits of another task’s environment.

An example of a task failure that might occur in an unprotected system involves reading
and writing to a serial port register for communication. If one task is using the port, there
is no way to prevent another task from using the same port. Successful use of the port must
be coordinated through a system call that provides access to the port. An unauthorized
access by a task working around these calls can easily disrupt communications through
