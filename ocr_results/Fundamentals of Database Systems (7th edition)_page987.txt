tonworks include on their Web sites documentation about their own distributions
of MapReduce/Hadoop-related technologies. The Berkeley Amplab (https://

There are some good references that outline the promise of big data technology and
large scale data management. Bill Franks (2012) talks about how to leverage big
data technologies for advanced analytics and provides insights that will help practi-
tioners make better decisions. Schmarzo (2013) discusses how the big data analytics
can empower businesses. Dietrich et al. (2014) describe how IBM has applied the
power of big data analytics across the enterprise in applications worldwide. A book
published by McKinsey Global Institute (2012) gives a strategic angle on big data
technologies by focusing on productivity, competitiveness, and growth.

There has been a parallel development in the cloud technologies that we have not
been able to discuss in detail in this chapter. We refer the reader to recent books on
cloud computing. Erl et al. (2013) discusses models, architectures, and business
practices and desccribes how this technology has matured in practice. Kavis (2014)
presents the various service models, including software as a service (SaaS), platform
as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Bahga and Madisetti
(2013) offer a practical, hands-on introduction to cloud computing. They describe
how to develop cloud applications on various cloud platforms, such as Amazon
Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft’s Windows Azure.
