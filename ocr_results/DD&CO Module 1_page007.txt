used extensively as standard logic gates and are in fact far more popular than the AND and OR gates.
This is because NAND and NOR gates are easily constructed with transistor circuits and because digital

circuits can be easily implemented with them.

The exclusive-OR gate has a graphic symbol similar to that of the OR gate, except for the additional
curved line on the input side. The equivalence, or exclusive-NOR, gate is the complement of the

exclusive-OR, as indicated by the small circle on the output side of the graphic symbol.
