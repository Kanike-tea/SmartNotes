EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT, which associates each employee with the depart-
ment for which the employee works. Each relationship instance in the relationship
set WORKS_FOR associates one EMPLOYEE entity and one DEPARTMENT
entity. Figure 3.9 illustrates this example, where each relationship instance r; is
shown connected to the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT entities that participate
in r;. In the miniworld represented by Figure 3.9, the employees e), e3, and eg work
for department d}; the employees e) and e4 work for department d); and the employ-
ees es and e7 work for department d3.

In ER diagrams, relationship types are displayed as diamond-shaped boxes, which
are connected by straight lines to the rectangular boxes representing the participat-
ing entity types. The relationship name is displayed in the diamond-shaped box
(see Figure 3.2).

3.4.2 Relationship Degree, Role Names, and Recursive
Relationships

Degree of a Relationship Type. The degree of a relationship type is the number
of participating entity types. Hence, the WORKS_FOR relationship is of degree
two. A relationship type of degree two is called binary, and one of degree three is
called ternary. An example of a ternary relationship is SUPPLY, shown in Fig-
ure 3.10, where each relationship instance r; associates three entities—a supplier s, a
part p, and a project j—whenever s supplies part p to project j. Relationships can
