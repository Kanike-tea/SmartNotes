620 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

Unsigned long multiply and multiply accumulate (see the SMLAL and SMULL entries)

UMLAL
UMULL
UQADD Unsigned saturated add and subtract (see the QADD entry)
UQSUB
USAD Unsigned sum of absolute differences
1. USAD8<cond> Rd, Rm, Rs ARMv6
2. USADA8<cond> Rd, Rm, Rs, Rn ARMv6
Action
1. Rd = abs (Rm[31:24]-Rs[31:24]) + abs(Rm[23:16] -Rs[23:16])
+ abs (Rm[15:08]-Rs[15:08]) + abs (Rm[07:00]-Rs[07:00])
2. Rd = Rn + abs(Rm[31:24]-Rs[31:24]) + abs (Rm[23:16]-Rs[23:16])
+ abs (Rm[15:08]-Rs[15:08]) + abs (Rm[07:00]-Rs[07:00])
Notes
= abs(x) returns the absolute value of x. Rm and Rs are treated as unsigned.
= Rd, Rm, and Rs must not be pe.
= The sum of absolute differences operation is common in video codecs where it provides
a metric to measure how similar two images are.
USAT Unsigned saturation instruction (see the SSAT entry)
USUB Unsigned parallel modulo subtracts (see the SADD entry)
UXT Unsigned extract, extract with accumulate (see the entry for SXT)
UXTA
