Digital Design and Computer Organization (BCS302) Module 3

» Microphones can be used to capture audio input which is then sampled and converted
into digital codes for storage and processing.

Similarly, cameras can be used to capture video input.

> Digital communication facilities, such as the Internet, can also provide input
to acomputer from other computers and database servers.

The function of the memory unit is to store programs and data.

There are two classes of storage, called primary and secondary.

Primary Memory:

Primary memory, also called main memory, is a fast memory that operates at electronic
speeds.

Programs must be stored in this memory while they are being executed.

The memory consists of a dase number of semiconductor storage cells, each capable of
storing one bit of information. These cells are rarely read or written individually.

Instead, they are handled in groups of fixed size called words.

The memory is organized so that one word can be stored or retrieved in one basic
operation.

The number of bits in each word is referred to as the word length of the computer,
typically 16, 32, or 64 bits.

Vv

To provide easy access to any word in the memory, a distinct address is associated with
each word location.

Vv

Addresses are consecutive numbers, starting from 0, that identify successive locations.

Vv

A particular word is accessed by specifying its address and issuing a control command to
the memory that starts the storage or retrieval process.

Vv

Instructions and data can be written into or read from the memory under the control of the
processor.

Vv

It is essential to be able to access any word location in the memory as quickly as possible.

Vv

A memory in which any location can be accessed in a short and fixed amount of time after
specifying its address is called a random-access memory (RAM). The time required to
access one word is called the memory access time. This time is independent of the
location of the word being accessed.

> It typically ranges from a few nanoseconds (ns) to about 100 ns for current RAM units.
