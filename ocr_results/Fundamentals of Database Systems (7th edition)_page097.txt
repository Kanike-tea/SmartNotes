components of a composite attribute between parentheses ( ) and separating
the components with commas, and by displaying multivalued attributes between
braces { }. Such attributes are called complex attributes. For example, if a person
can have more than one residence and each residence can have a single address and
multiple phones, an attribute Address_phone for a person can be specified as shown
in Figure 3.5.* Both Phone and Address are themselves composite attributes.

3.3.2 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Keys, and Value Sets

Entity Types and Entity Sets. A database usually contains groups of entities that
are similar. For example, a company employing hundreds of employees may want to
store similar information concerning each of the employees. These employee entities
share the same attributes, but each entity has its own value(s) for each attribute. An
entity type defines a collection (or set) of entities that have the same attributes. Each
entity type in the database is described by its name and attributes. Figure 3.6 shows
two entity types: EMPLOYEE and COMPANY, and a list of some of the attributes
for each. A few individual entities of each type are also illustrated, along with the
values of their attributes. The collection of all entities of a particular entity type in the

XML (see Chapter 13).
