3.4.3 Constraints on Binary Relationship Types

Relationship types usually have certain constraints that limit the possible combina-
tions of entities that may participate in the corresponding relationship set. These
constraints are determined from the miniworld situation that the relationships rep-
resent. For example, in Figure 3.9, if the company has a rule that each employee
must work for exactly one department, then we would like to describe this con-
straint in the schema. We can distinguish two main types of binary relationship
constraints: cardinality ratio and participation.

Cardinality Ratios for Binary Relationships. The cardinality ratio for a binary
relationship specifies the maximum number of relationship instances that an entity
can participate in. For example, in the WORKS_FOR binary relationship type,
DEPARTMENT:EMPLOYEE is of cardinality ratio 1:N, meaning that each department
can be related to (that is, employs) any number of employees (N),? but an employee
can be related to (work for) at most one department (1). This means that for
this particular relationship type WORKS_FOR, a particular department entity can
be related to any number of employees (N indicates there is no maximum number).
On the other hand, an employee can be related to a maximum of one department.
The possible cardinality ratios for binary relationship types are 1:1, 1:N, N:1,
and M:N.

An example of a 1:1 binary relationship is MANAGES (Figure 3.12), which relates a
department entity to the employee who manages that department. This represents
the miniworld constraints that—at any point in time—an employee can manage at

®N stands for any number of related entities (zero or more). In some notations, the asterisk symbol (*) is
used instead of N.
