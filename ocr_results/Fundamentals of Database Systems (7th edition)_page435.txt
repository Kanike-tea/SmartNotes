12.4 Object Database Conceptual Design

GRADE.” These relationships are represented by the following relationship proper-
ties: Completed_sections of STUDENT; Section and Student of GRADE; and Students of
SECTION (see Figure 12.10). Finally, the class DEGREE is used to represent the com-
posite, multivalued attribute degrees of GRAD_STUDENT (see Figure 8.10).

Because the previous example does not include any interfaces, only classes, we now
utilize a different example to illustrate interfaces and interface (behavior) inheri-
tance. Figure 12.11 (a) is part of a database schema for storing geometric objects. An
interface GeometryObject is specified, with operations to calculate the perimeter and
area of a geometric object, plus operations to translate (move) and rotate an object.
Several classes (RECTANGLE, TRIANGLE, CIRCLE, ...) inherit the GeometryObject
interface. Since GeometryObject is an interface, it is noninstantiable—that is, no
objects can be created based on this interface directly. However, objects of type
RECTANGLE, TRIANGLE, CIRCLE, ... can be created, and these objects inherit all the
operations of the GeometryObject interface. Note that with interface inheritance,
only operations are inherited, not properties (attributes, relationships). Hence, if a
property is needed in the inheriting class, it must be repeated in the class defini-
tion, as with the Reference_point attribute in Figure 12.11(b). Notice that the inher-
ited operations can have different implementations in each class. For example, the
implementations of the area and perimeter operations may be different for
RECTANGLE, TRIANGLE, and CIRCLE.

Multiple inheritance of interfaces by a class is allowed, as is multiple inheritance of
interfaces by another interface. However, with extends (class) inheritance, multiple
inheritance is not permitted. Hence, a class can inherit via extends from at most one
class (in addition to inheriting from zero or more interfaces).

12.4 Object Database Conceptual Design

Section 12.4.1 discusses how object database (ODB) design differs from relational
database (RDB) design. Section 12.4.2 outlines a mapping algorithm that can be
used to create an ODB schema, made of ODMG ODL class definitions, from a con-
ceptual EER schema.

12.4.1 Differences between Conceptual Design
of ODB and RDB

One of the main differences between ODB and RDB design is how relationships are
handled. In ODB, relationships are typically handled by having relationship prop-
erties or reference attributes that include OID(s) of the related objects. These can be
considered as OID references to the related objects. Both single references and col-
lections of references are allowed. References for a binary relationship can be

33This is similar to how an M:N relationship is mapped in the relational model (see Section 9.1) and in
the legacy network model (see Appendix E).
