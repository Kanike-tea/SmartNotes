Table 2.5 Condition mnemonics.

Mnemonic Name Condition flags
EQ equal Z

NE not equal z

CS HS carry set/unsigned higher or same c

cc Lo carry clear/unsigned lower c

MI minus/negative N

PL plus/positive or zero n

VS overflow v

ve no overflow v

HI unsigned higher 2C

Ls unsigned lower or same Zorc

GE signed greater than or equal NV or nv

LT signed less than Nvor nv

GT signed greater than NzVor nzv

LE signed less than or equal Zor Nvor nV
AL always (unconditional) ignored

can see from the figure the processor is in supervisor (SVC) mode since the mode[4:0] is
equal to binary 10011.

2.2.6 CONDITIONAL EXECUTION

Conditional execution controls whether or not the core will execute an instruction.
Most instructions have a condition attribute that determines if the core will execute it
based on the setting of the condition flags. Prior to execution, the processor compares the
condition attribute with the condition flags in the cpsr. If they match, then the instruction
is executed; otherwise the instruction is ignored.

The condition attribute is postfixed to the instruction mnemonic, which is encoded
into the instruction. Table 2.5 lists the conditional execution code mnemonics. When a
condition mnemonic is not present, the default behavior is to set it to always (AL) execute.

2.3 PIPELINE

A pipeline is the mechanism a RISC processor uses to execute instructions. Using a pipeline
speeds up execution by fetching the next instruction while other instructions are being
decoded and executed. One way to view the pipeline is to think of it as an automobile
assembly line, with each stage carrying out a particular task to manufacture the vehicle.
