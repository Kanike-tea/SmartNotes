THEOREM 2-7

An Euler graph G is arbitrarily traceable from vertex v in G if and only if
every circuit in G contains v.

For a proof of the theorem the reader is referred to [2-5].

2-9. HAMILTONIAN PATHS AND CIRCUITS

An Euler line of a connected graph was characterized by the property of being
a closed walk that traverses every edge of the graph (exactly once). A
Hamiltonian circuit in a connected graph is defined as a closed walk that
traverses every vertex of G exactly once, except of course the starting vertex, at
which the walk also terminates. For example, in the graph of Fig. 2-20(a)
starting at vertex v, if one traverses along the edges shown in heavy lines—
passing through each vertex exactly once—one gets a Hamiltonian circuit. A
Hamiltonian circuit for the graph in Fig. 2-20(b) is also shown by heavy lines.
