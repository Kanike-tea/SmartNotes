Chapter 15 Relational Database Design Algorithms and Further Dependencies

Step 3 of Algorithm 15.4 involves identifying a key K of R. Algorithm 15.2(a) can be
used to identify a key K of R based on the set of given functional dependencies F.
Notice that the set of functional dependencies used to determine a key in Algo-
rithm 15.2(a) could be either F or G, since they are equivalent.

Example 1 of Algorithm 15.4. Consider the following universal relation:
U (Emp_ssn, Pno, Esal, Ephone, Dno, Pname, Plocation)

Emp_ssn, Esal, and Ephone refer to the Social Security number, salary, and phone
number of the employee. Pno, Pname, and Plocation refer to the number, name, and
location of the project. Dno is the department number.

‘The following dependencies are present:
FD1: Emp_ssn > {Esal, Ephone, Dno}
FD2: Pno — { Pname, Plocation}
FD3: Emp_ssn, Pno — {Esal, Ephone, Dno, Pname, Plocation}

By virtue of FD3, the attribute set {Emp_ssn, Pno} represents a key of the universal
relation. Hence F, the set of given FDs, includes {Emp_ssn — Esal, Ephone, Dno;
Pno — Pname, Plocation; Emp_ssn, Pno — Esal, Ephone, Dno, Pname, Plocation}.

By applying the minimal cover Algorithm 15.2, in step 3 we see that Pno is an extra-
neous attribute in Emp_ssn, Pno > Esal, Ephone, Dno. Moreover, Emp_ssn is extrane-
ous in Emp_ssn, Pno — Pname, Plocation. Hence the minimal cover consists of FD1
and FD2 only (FD3 being completely redundant) as follows (if we group attributes
with the same left-hand side into one FD):

Minimal cover G: {Emp_ssn > Esal, Ephone, Dno; Pho — Pname, Plocation}
‘The second step of Algorithm 15.4 produces relations R, and R, as:

R, (Emp_ssn, Esal, Ephone, Dno)

Ry (Pno, Pname, Plocation)

In step 3, we generate a relation corresponding to the key {Emp_ssn, Pno} of U.
Hence, the resulting design contains:

R, (Emp_ssn, Esal, Ephone, Dno)
R, (Pno, Pname, Plocation)
R3 (Emp_ssn, Pno)

‘This design achieves both the desirable properties of dependency preservation and
nonadditive join.

Example 2 of Algorithm 15.4 (Case X). Consider the relation schema LOTS1A
shown in Figure 14.13(a).

Assume that this relation is given as a universal relation U (Property_id, County, Lot#,
Area) with the following functional dependencies:
