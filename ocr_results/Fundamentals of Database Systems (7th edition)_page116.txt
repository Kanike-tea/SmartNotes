The COMPANY conceptual schema in UML class diagram notation.

ways, class diagrams can be considered as an alternative notation to ER diagrams.
Additional UML notation and concepts are presented in Section 8.6. Figure 3.16
shows how the COMPANY ER database schema in Figure 3.15 can be displayed
using UML class diagram notation. The entity types in Figure 3.15 are modeled as
classes in Figure 3.16. An entity in ER corresponds to an object in UML.

In UML class diagrams, a class (similar to an entity type in ER) is displayed as a box
(see Figure 3.16) that includes three sections: The top section gives the class name
(similar to entity type name); the middle section includes the attributes; and the
last section includes operations that can be applied to individual objects (similar to
individual entities in an entity set) of the class. Operations are not specified in ER
diagrams. Consider the EMPLOYEE class in Figure 3.16. Its attributes are Name, Ssn,
Bdate, Sex, Address, and Salary. The designer can optionally specify the domain (or
data type) of an attribute if desired, by placing a colon (:) followed by the domain
name or description, as illustrated by the Name, Sex, and Bdate attributes
of EMPLOYEE in Figure 3.16. A composite attribute is modeled as a
structured domain, as illustrated by the Name attribute of EMPLOYEE. A multival-
ued attribute will generally be modeled as a separate class, as illustrated by the
LOCATION class in Figure 3.16.
