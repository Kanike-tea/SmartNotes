4.1 Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance 109

subclass or subtype of the EMPLOYEE entity type, and the EMPLOYEE entity type is
called the superclass or supertype for each of these subclasses. Figure 4.1 shows how
to represent these concepts diagramatically in EER diagrams. (The circle notation in
Figure 4.1 will be explained in Section 4.2.)

We call the relationship between a superclass and any one of its subclasses a
superclass/subclass or supertype/subtype or simply class/subclass relationship.’
In our previous example, EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY and EMPLOYEE/TECHNICIAN
are two class/subclass relationships. Notice that a member entity of the subclass
represents the same real-world entity as some member of the superclass; for
example, a SECRETARY entity ‘Joan Logano ’ is also the EMPLOYEE ‘Joan Logano.’
Hence, the subclass member is the same as the entity in the superclass, but in a
distinct specific role. When we implement a superclass/subclass relationship in
the database system, however, we may represent a member of the subclass as a
distinct database object—say, a distinct record that is related via the key attribute
to its superclass entity. In Section 9.2, we discuss various options for representing
superclass/subclass relationships in relational databases.

An entity cannot exist in the database merely by being a member of a subclass; it
must also be a member of the superclass. Such an entity can be included optionally

3A class/subclass relationship is often called an IS-A (or IS-AN) relationship because of the way we
refer to the concept. We say a SECRETARY js an EMPLOYEE, a TECHNICIAN is an EMPLOYEE, and
so on.
