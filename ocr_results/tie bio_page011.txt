If the CNS is the processing center of the human body, the brain is its headquarters. It is
broadly organised into three main regions - the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain.
The largest of these three is the forebrain (derived from the prosencephalon in the developing
brain). It contains the large outermost layer of the brain, the wrinkly cerebral cortex, and
smaller structures towards its centre, such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, and the pineal
gland.

Explain the process of signal transmission by the brain to different parts of the body.

Answer:

A neuron sending a signal (i.e., a presynaptic neuron) releases a chemical called a
neurotransmitter, which binds to a receptor on the surface of the receiving (i.e., postsynaptic)
neuron. Neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic terminals, which may branch to
communicate with several postsynaptic neurons.

Axon terminals are where neurotransmission begins. Hence, it is at axon terminals where the
neuron sends its OUTPUT to other neurons. At electrical synapses, the OUTPUT will be the
electrical signal itself. At chemical synapses, the OUTPUT will be neurotransmitter.

The correct outline for the sequence of transmission of an electrical impulse through a neuron
is dendrites, cell body, axon, axon terminal.
