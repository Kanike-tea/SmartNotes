Microcontrollers - BCS402

An interrupt controller connects multiple external interrupts to one of the two ARM interrupt
requests. Sophisticated controllers can be programmed to allow an external interrupt source to

cause either an IRQ or FIQ exception.
When it comes to assigning interrupts, system designers have adopted a standard design practice:

¢ Software Interrupts are normally reserved to call privileged operating system routines.
For example, an SWI instruction can be used to change a program running in user mode
to a privileged mode.

e Interrupt Requests are normally assigned for general-purpose interrupts. For example, a
periodic timer interrupt to force a context switch tends to be an IRQ exception. The IRQ
exception has a lower priority and higher interrupt latency (to be discussed in the next
section) than the FIQ exception.

e Fast Interrupt Requests are normally reserved for a single interrupt source that requires a
fast response time—for example, direct memory access specifically used to move blocks
of memory. Thus, in an embedded operating system design, the FIQ exception is used for
a specific application, leaving the IRQ exception for more general operating system

activities.
2.2 Interrupt Latency

Interrupt latency—the interval of time from an external interrupt request signal being raised to

the first fetch of an instruction of a specific interrupt service routine (ISR).

Interrupt latency depends on a combination of hardware and software. System architects must
balance the system design to handle multiple simultaneous interrupt sources and minimize
interrupt latency. If the interrupts are not handled in a timely manner, then the system will

exhibit slow response times.

Software handlers have two main methods to minimize interrupt latency. The first method is to
use a nested interrupt handler, which allows further interrupts to occur even when currently
servicing an existing interrupt (see Figure 3). This is achieved by re enabling the interrupts as

soon as the interrupt source has been serviced (so it won’t generate more interrupts) but before
