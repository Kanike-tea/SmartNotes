3.2.2 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Keys, and Value Sets

Entity Types

An entity type defines a collection (or set) of entities that have the same attributes. Each entity
type in the database is described by its name and attributes. For,example, a company employing
hundreds of employees may want to store similar information concerning each of the employees.
These employee entities share the same attributes, but each entity has its own value(s) for each

attribute.

Entity Sets

The collection of all entities of a particular entity type in the database at any point in time is called
an entity set; the entity set is usually referred to using the same name as the entity type. For
example, EMPLOYEE refers to both a type of entity as well as the current set of all employee

entities in the database.
