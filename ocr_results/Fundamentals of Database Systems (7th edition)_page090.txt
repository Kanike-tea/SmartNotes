Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

Object modeling methodologies such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
are becoming increasingly popular in both database and software design. These
methodologies go beyond database design to specify detailed design of software
modules and their interactions using various types of diagrams. An important part
of these methodologies—namely, class diagrams'—is similar in many ways to the
ER diagrams. In class diagrams, operations on objects are specified, in addition to
specifying the database schema structure. Operations can be used to specify the
functional requirements during database design, as we will discuss in Section 3.1.
We present some of the UML notation and concepts for class diagrams that are
particularly relevant to database design in Section 3.8, and we briefly compare these
to ER notation and concepts. Additional UML notation and concepts are presented
in Section 4.6.

This chapter is organized as follows: Section 3.1 discusses the role of high-level con-
ceptual data models in database design. We introduce the requirements for a sam-
ple database application in Section 3.2 to illustrate the use of concepts from the ER
model. This sample database is used throughout the text. In Section 3.3 we present
the concepts of entities and attributes, and we gradually introduce the diagram-
matic technique for displaying an ER schema. In Section 3.4 we introduce the con-
cepts of binary relationships and their roles and structural constraints. Section 3.5
introduces weak entity types. Section 3.6 shows how a schema design is refined to
include relationships. Section 3.7 reviews the notation for ER diagrams, summa-
rizes the issues and common pitfalls that occur in schema design, and discusses
how to choose the names for database schema constructs such as entity types and
relationship types. Section 3.8 introduces some UML class diagram concepts, com-
pares them to ER model concepts, and applies them to the same COMPANY data-
base example. Section 3.9 discusses more complex types of relationships. Sec-
tion 3.10 summarizes the chapter.

The material in Sections 3.8 and 3.9 may be excluded from an introductory course. If
amore thorough coverage of data modeling concepts and conceptual database design
is desired, the reader should continue to Chapter 4, where we describe extensions to
the ER model that lead to the enhanced-ER (EER) model, which includes concepts
such as specialization, generalization, inheritance, and union types (categories).

3.1 Using High-Level Conceptual Data Models
for Database Design

Figure 3.1 shows a simplified overview of the database design process. The first step
shown is requirements collection and analysis. During this step, the database
designers interview prospective database users to understand and document their
data requirements. The result of this step is a concisely written set of users’ require-
ments. These requirements should be specified in as detailed and complete a form
as possible. In parallel with specifying the data requirements, it is useful to specify

'A class is similar to an entity type in many ways.
