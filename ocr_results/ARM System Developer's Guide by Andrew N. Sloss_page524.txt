can be assigned to 1 MB sections of virtual memory and are assigned to a section by setting
the domain bit field in the master L1 PTE (see Figure 14.6).

When a domain is assigned to a section, it must obey the domain access rights assigned
to the domain. Domain access rights are assigned in the CP15:c3 register and control the
processor core’s ability to access sections of virtual memory.

The CP15:c3 register uses two bits for each domain to define the access permitted for
each of the 16 available domains. Table 14.5 shows the value and meaning of a domain
access bit field. Figure 14.12 gives the format of the CP15:c3:c0 register, which holds the
domain access control information. The 16 available domains are labeled from D0 to D15
in the figure.

Even if you don’t use the virtual memory capabilities provided by the MMU, you can
still use these cores as simple memory protection units: first, by mapping virtual memory
directly to physical memory, assigning a different domain to each task, then using domains
to protect dormant tasks by assigning their domain access to “no access.”

Domain access bit assignments.

Manager in access is uncontrolled, no permission aborts generated
Reserved 10 unpredictable

Client 01 access controlled by permission values set in PTE

No access 00 generates a domain fault
