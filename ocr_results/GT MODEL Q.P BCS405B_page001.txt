For any Spanning tree of a connected graph with n vertices and e edges, prove
that there are n — 1 tree branches and e —n +1 chords. For the following
graph, find two spanning trees and hence show that an edge that is a branch of
one spanning tree can be a chord with respect to another spanning tree of same
graph.
