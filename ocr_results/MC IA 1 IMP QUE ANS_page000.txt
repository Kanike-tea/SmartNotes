Pipeline and Interrupts in ARM Processors

Pipeline: A pipeline is a mechanism used by RISC processors like ARM to speed up instruction
execution . It breaks down the processing of instructions into smaller units that can be executed in
parallel . For example, a three-stage pipeline involves Fetch (loading an instruction from memory),
Decode (identifying the instruction), and Execute (processing the instruction and writing the result to
a register) . While one instruction is being executed, the next instruction can be decoded, and the
one after that can be fetched1 .... This allows the processor to achieve a higher throughput by
executing an instruction (ideally) every cycle once the pipeline is full2 .... Different ARM families have
pipelines of varying lengths, such as the three-stage pipeline in ARM71 , the five-stage pipeline in
ARM9S , and the six-stage pipeline in ARM106 . A key characteristic is that the program counter (pc)
in the execute stage typically points to the address of the instruction plus 8 bytes (for ARM state),
representing two instructions ahead7 . Branch instructions or direct modification of the pc cause the
pipeline to be flushed .

Interrupts: When an exception or interrupt occurs, the processor suspends normal execution and
sets the program counter (pc) to a specific memory address within the vector table9 . The vector
table, usually located at address 0x00000000 (or optionally at Oxffff0000), contains instructions that
branch to specific routines designed to handle that particular exception or interrupt9 .... The source
describes several vectors, including Interrupt Request (IRQ), used by external hardware to interrupt
normal execution if IRQs are not masked in the Current Program Status Register (cpsr), and Fast
Interrupt Request (FIQ), reserved for hardware needing faster response times, which requires FIQs
to be unmasked in the cpsr11 .... When an interrupt occurs, the processor may also change its mode
(e.g., from User mode to Interrupt Request mode), and certain registers (like r13 and r14) might be
banked to save the user mode context13 .... An interrupt controller provides programmable policies
to manage which peripheral or device can interrupt the processor15 .

Differences Between RISC and CISC Architectures

RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer): Emphasizes compiler complexity over hardware
complexity16 . RISC processors have a reduced number of instruction classes that provide simple
operations, with most executing in a single cycle at a high clock speed16 nstructions in RISC are
of fixed length, facilitating instruction fetching for the pipeline2 . RISC machines typically have a large
set of general-purpose registers, where any register can hold data or an address18 . They employ a
load-store architecture, meaning the processor operates on data in registers, and separate load and
store instructions are used for transferring data between registers and external memory18 ....

CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer): Emphasizes hardware complexity16 . CISC relies more on
the hardware for instruction functionality, resulting in more complicated instructions16 .... CISC
processors often have instructions of variable size that can take multiple cycles to execute2 . They
may have dedicated registers for specific purposes, rather than a large set of general-purpose
