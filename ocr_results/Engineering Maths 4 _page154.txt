Thus we have proved that 1 and v are harmonic.

Note : The converse of this theorem is not true. That is to say that we can give examples of

function u & v satisfying Laplace's equation but not satisfying Cauchy-Riemann equations,

This shows that u and v are harmonic functions.

Hence u+iv isnot analytic.

[3.52] Orthogonal-Property :
if f(z) = uriv is analytic then the family of curves u(x, y) = c
O(x, ¥) = Cy, c, and -c,, being constants, intersect each other orthogonally.

Proof: We know that two cuves intersect each other orthogonally if the tangents at

the point of intersection are at right angles. Further we know that = represents slope
of the tangent and the condition for perpendicularity of two lines is that the product

of their slopes must be equal to - 1. -

Consider u (x i y)= Gy and differentiating w.rt x treating y as a function of x
we get, ‘ :
