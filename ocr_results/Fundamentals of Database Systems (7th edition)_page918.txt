Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems

1. Document-based NOSQL systems: These systems store data in the form of
documents using well-known formats, such as JSON (JavaScript Object
Notation). Documents are accessible via their document id, but can also be
accessed rapidly using other indexes.

2. NOSQL key-value stores: These systems have a simple data model based
on fast access by the key to the value associated with the key; the value can
be a record or an object or a document or even have a more complex data
structure.

3. Column-based or wide column NOSQL systems: These systems partition a
table by column into column families (a form of vertical partitioning; see
Section 23.2), where each column family is stored in its own files. They also
allow versioning of data values.

4. Graph-based NOSQL systems: Data is represented as graphs, and related
nodes can be found by traversing the edges using path expressions.

Additional categories can be added as follows to include some systems that are not
easily categorized into the above four categories, as well as some other types of sys-
tems that have been available even before the term NOSQL became widely used.

5. Hybrid NOSQL systems: These systems have characteristics from two or
more of the above four categories.

6. Object databases: These systems were discussed in Chapter 12.
7. XML databases: We discussed XML in Chapter 13.

Even keyword-based search engines store large amounts of data with fast search
access, so the stored data can be considered as large NOSQL big data stores.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In each of Sections 24.3 through
24.6, we will discuss one of the four main categories of NOSQL systems, and elabo-
rate further on which characteristics each category focuses on. Before that, in Sec-
tion 24.2, we discuss in more detail the concept of eventual consistency, and we
discuss the associated CAP theorem.

24.2 The CAP Theorem

When we discussed concurrency control in distributed databases in Section 23.3,
we assumed that the distributed database system (DDBS) is required to enforce the
ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) of transactions that
are running concurrently (see Section 20.3). In a system with data replication, con-
currency control becomes more complex because there can be multiple copies of
each data item. So if an update is applied to one copy of an item, it must be applied
to all other copies in a consistent manner. The possibility exists that one copy of an
item X is updated by a transaction T; whereas another copy is updated by a transac-
tion T, so two inconsistent copies of the same item exist at two different nodes in
the distributed system. If two other transactions T3 and T, want to read X, each may
read a different copy of item X.
