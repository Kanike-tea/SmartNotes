25.3 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

the Input that the Job is to run on: typically specified as an HDFS path(s)
the Format(Structure) of the Input

the Output path

the Output Structure

the Reduce-side parallelism

A Job is submitted to the JobTracker, which then schedules and manages the exe-
cution of the Job. It provides a set of interfaces to monitor running Jobs. See the
Hadoop Wiki! for further details about the workings of the JobTracker.

25.2.3 Hadoop Releases

Since the advent of Hadoop as a new distributed framework to run MapReduce
programs, various releases have been produced:

The 1.x releases of Hadoop are a continuation of the original 0.20 code base.
Subreleases with this line have added Security, additional HDFS and MapReduce
improvements to support HBase, a better MR programming model, as well as
other improvements.

The 2.x releases include the following major features:

5 YARN (Yet Another Resource Navigator) is a general resource manager
extracted out of the JobTracker from MR version1.

o Anew MRruntime that runs on top of YARN.

© Improved HDFS that supports federation and increased availability.

At the time of this writing, Hadoop 2.0 has been around for about a year. The
adoption is rapidly picking up; but a significant percentage of Hadoop deployments
still run on Hadoop v1.

25.3 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

As we said earlier, in addition to MapReduce, the other core component of Hadoop
is the underlying file system HDFS. In this section, we will first explain the architec-
ture of HDFS, then describe the file input/output operations supported in HDFS,
and finally comment on the scalability of HDFS.

25.3.1 HDFS Preliminaries

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the file system component of
Hadoop and is designed to run on a cluster of commodity hardware. HDFS is pat-
terned after the UNIX file system; however, it relaxes a few POSIX (portable oper-
ating system interface) requirements to enable streaming access to file system data.
HDEFS provides high-throughput access to large datasets. HDFS stores file system
