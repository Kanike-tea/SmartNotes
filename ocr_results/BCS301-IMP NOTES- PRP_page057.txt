Expected number of heads in 400 tosses=np=400x0.5=200 , npq=100

x-K _ x—np

” Consider Q = 5 = Sapa
eZ=Te= = 16 < 196

Critical value of z at alpha = 0.05 is 1.96
Therefore accept the hypothesis that the coin is unbiased at the 5% level of significance.

3) A coin was tossed 1600 times and the tailed turned up 864 times. Test the hypothesis that the
Coin is unbiased at 1% level of significance.
Sol.
Let us suppose that the coin is unbiased .
and let p= the probability of getting a tail in one toss=1/2=0.5
Since p+q=1, q=1-p=1/2=0.5
Expected number of tailed in 1600 tosses=np=1600x0.5=800, npq=400
-. The difference is x —  =864-800=64
-. Consider Z=

— 4 —
= 2 =e = 3.2 > 258

1% level of significance = 99% confidence level.
Therefore accept the hypothesis that the coin is biased.

4) In 324 throws of a six faced 'die' , an odd number turned up 181 times. Is it possible to think
that the 'die' is an unbiased one?
Sol.

Let us suppose that the die is unbiased.
and let p= the probability of the turn up of an odd number is=3/6=1/2=0.5
Since p+q=1 , q=1-p=1/2=0.5
Expected number of successes=np=324x0.5=162, npq=81
-. The difference is x — u =181-162=19

x-K _ x—np

” Consit a = Ban
ela Za2il < 2.58

Thus we can that the die is unbiased

5) A die is thrown 9000 times and a throw of 3 or 4 was observed 3240 times. Show that the die
Can not be regarded as an unbiased one,
Sol.
The probability of getting 3 or 4 in a single through is p = OP = Vy,
1_2
Andq=1-p=1-7=3
-. Expected number of success = ; x 9000 = 3000

-. The difference =3240-3000=240

Consider > Z =

~ Yz000
=Z=5.37

Since Z=5.37>2.58 ,
We conclude that the die is biased.

Test of significance for proportion:

Test of significance of single proportion:

To test the significant difference between the sample proportion p and the population proportion P,
we use the statistic.
