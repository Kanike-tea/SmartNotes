12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL

It is also possible to define virtual attributes as part of UDTs, which are computed
and updated using functions.

12.2.5 Specifying Inheritance and Overloading of Functions

In SQL, inheritance can be applied to types or to tables; we will discuss the meaning
of each in this section. Recall that we already discussed many of the principles of
inheritance in Section 12.1.5. SQL has rules for dealing with type inheritance
(specified via the UNDER keyword). In general, both attributes and instance meth-
ods (operations) are inherited. The phrase NOT FINAL must be included in a UDT if
subtypes are allowed to be created under that UDT (see Figures 12.4(a) and (b),
where PERSON_TYPE, STUDENT_TYPE, and EMPLOYEE_TYPE are declared to be
NOT FINAL). Associated with type inheritance are the rules for overloading of func-
tion implementations and for resolution of function names. These inheritance rules
can be summarized as follows:

= Allattributes are inherited.

= The order of supertypes in the UNDER clause determines the inheritance
hierarchy.

= An instance of a subtype can be used in every context in which a supertype
instance is used.

= A subtype can redefine any function that is defined in its supertype, with the
restriction that the signature be the same.

= When a function is called, the best match is selected based on the types of all
arguments.

= For dynamic linking, the types of the parameters are considered at runtime.

Consider the following examples to illustrate type inheritance, which are illustrated
in Figure 12.4(c). Suppose that we want to create two subtypes of PERSON_TYPE:
EMPLOYEE_TYPE and STUDENT_TYPE. In addition, we also create a subtype
MANAGER_TYPE that inherits all the attributes (and methods) of EMPLOYEE_TYPE
but has an additional attribute DEPT.MANAGED. These subtypes are shown in
Figure 12.4(c).

In general, we specify the local (specific) attributes and any additional specific
methods for the subtype, which inherits the attributes and operations (methods) of

its supertype.

Another facility in SQL is table inheritance via the supertable/subtable facility.
This is also specified using the keyword UNDER (see Figure 12.4(d)). Here, a new
record that is inserted into a subtable, say the MANAGER table, is also inserted into
its supertables EMPLOYEE and PERSON. Notice that when a record is inserted in
MANAGER, we must provide values for all its inherited attributes. INSERT, DELETE,
and UPDATE operations are appropriately propagated. Basically, table inheritance
corresponds to the extent inheritance discussed in Section 12.1.5. The rule is that a
tuple in a sub-table must also exist in its super-table to enforce the set/subset con-
straint on the objects.
