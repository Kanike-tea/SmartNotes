1.1.1 Comparisons Involving NULL and Three-Valued Logic

SQL has various rules for dealing with NULL values. NULL is used to represent a missing value, but
that it usually has one of three different interpretations—value

Example

1. Unknown value. A person’s date of birth is not known, so it is represented by NULL in the
database.

2. Unavailable or withheld value. A person has a home phone but does not want it to be
listed, so it is withheld and represented as NULL in the database.

3. Not applicable attribute. An attribute CollegeDegree would be NULL for a person who has no

college degrees because it does not apply to that person.

Each individual NULL value is considered to be different from every other NULL value in the various
database records. When a NULL is involved in a comparison operation, the result is considered to
be UNKNOWN (it may be TRUE or it may be FALSE). Hence, SQL uses a three-valued logic with
values TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN instead of the standard two-valued (Boolean) logic with
values TRUE or FALSE. It is therefore necessary to define the results (or truth values) of three-
valued logical expressions when the logical connectives AND, OR, and NOT are used
