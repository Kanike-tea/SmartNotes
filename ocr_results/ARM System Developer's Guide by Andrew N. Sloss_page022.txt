1.3 Embedded System Hardware 9

The example device shown in Figure 1.2 has three buses: an AHB bus for the high-
performance peripherals, an APB bus for the slower peripherals, and a third bus for external
peripherals, proprietary to this device. This external bus requires a specialized bridge to
connect with the AHB bus.

1.3.3. MEMORY

Figure 1.3

‘An embedded system has to have some form of memory to store and execute code. You
have to compare price, performance, and power consumption when deciding upon specific
memory characteristics, such as hierarchy, width, and type. If memory has to run twice as
fast to maintain a desired bandwidth, then the memory power requirement may be higher.

1.3.3.1 Hierarchy

All computer systems have memory arranged in some form of hierarchy. Figure 1.2 shows
a device that supports external off-chip memory. Internal to the processor there is an option
of a cache (not shown in Figure 1.2) to improve memory performance.

Figure 1.3 shows the memory trade-offs: the fastest memory cache is physically located
nearer the ARM processor core and the slowest secondary memory is set further away.
Generally the closer memory is to the processor core, the more it costs and the smaller its
capacity.

The cache is placed between main memory and the core. It is used to speed up data
transfer between the processor and main memory. A cache provides an overall increase in
performance but with a loss of predictable execution time. Although the cache increases the
