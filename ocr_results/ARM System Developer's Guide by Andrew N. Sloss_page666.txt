D.2 ARM7TDMI Instruction Cycle Timings 653

Table D.2 Pipeline behavior statements.

Statement

Meaning

Rdis not available for k cycles.

Rnis required k cycles early.

Rnis not required until the
kth cycle,

You cannot start a type X
instruction for k cycles.

The result register Rd of the instruction is not available as the input to
another instruction for k cycles after the end of the instruction. If you
attempt to use Rd earlier, then the core will stall until the k cycles have
elapsed.

The input register Rn of the instruction must be available k cycles before
the start of the instruction. If it was the result of a later operation,

then the core will stall until this condition is met.

The input register Rn is not read on the first cycle of the instruction.
Instead it is read on the kth cycle of the instruction. Therefore the core
will not stall if Rn is available by this point.

The instruction uses a resource also used by type X instructions.
Moreover the instruction continues to use this resource for k cycles after
the last cycle of the instruction. If you attempt to execute a type X
instruction before k cycles have elapsed, then the core will stall until k
cycles have elapsed.

D.2 ARM7TDMI INSTRUCTION CYCLE TIMINGS

The ARM7TDMI core is based on a three-stage pipeline with a single execute stage. The
number of cycles an instruction takes does not usually depend on preceding or following

instructions. The multiplier circuit uses a 32-bit by 8-bit multiplier array with early ter-

mination. The number of multiply iteration cycles M depends on the value of register Rs
according to Table D.3. Table D.4 gives the ARM7TDMI instruction cycle timings.
