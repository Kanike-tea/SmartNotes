1.3. Isomorphism

41

Given two graphs G and G’, there is no set precedure for proving or disproving that they
are isomorphic. It is only by carefully examining the nature of vertices and edges of both G
and G’ that one can find whether or not they are isomorphic. If G and G’ are not isomorphic, it
js relatively easy to find it out. If G and G’ are isomorphic, the work involved in proving it is
quite hard — it gets harder as the orders and sizes of G and G’ get larger.

Jsomorphism of Digraphs

The definition of isomorphism of graphs can be extended to digraphs in a natural way. Two
digraphs D; and Dz are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between
their vertices and between their edges such that adjacency of vertices along with directions is
preserved.

[Example 1] Prove that the two graphs shown below are isomorphic.

‘1 v2 v1 v2
v3 v4 v3 v4

Figure 1.48

> We first observe that both graphs have four vertices and four edges. Consider the following
one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the graphs:

uy Vy, U2  V4> U3 © V3, U4 © V2.
This correspondence gives the following correspondence between the edges:

(uj.U2} @ (vinva}, {un wsh {v1, v3},

(up, us} 2 {v4 V2}, {u3, ug} © {v3, va}

These represent one-to-one correspondence between the edges of the two graphs xe
Which the adjacent vertices in the first graph correspond to adjacent vertices 1n the secon
Staph and vice-versa.

Accordingly, the two graphs are isomorphic.
