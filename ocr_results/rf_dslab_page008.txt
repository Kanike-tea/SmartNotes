3. Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on STACK of Integers (Array
Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX)

la. Push an Element on to Stack

ib. Pop an Element from Stack

\c. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome

\d. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack

le. Display the status of Stack

If. Exit

Theory:

A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out(LIFO) principle. A stack is a
limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. Push adds an item to the top
of the stack, pop removes the item from the top.

Basic Operations on Stack

In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us.
push() to insert an element into the stack

pop() to remove an element from the stack

top() Returns the top element of the stack.

isEmpty() returns true if stack is empty else false.

isFull() returns true if stack is full else false.

Program

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#define MAX 5

int s[MAX];
int top = -1;

void push(int item);
int pop();

void palindrome();
void display();

void main()
{
int choice, item;
while(1)
{
printf("\n\n\n\n-
printf("\n=>1.Push an Element to Stack and Overflow demo ");
printf("\n=>2.Pop an Element from Stack and Underflow demo");
printf("\n=>3 Palindrome demo ");
printf("\n=>4 Display ");
printf("\n=>5.Exit");
printf("\nEnter your choice: ");
scanf("%d", &choice);

switch(choice)
{
case 1: printf("\nEnter an element to be pushed: ");
scanf("%d" , &item);
push(item);
break;
