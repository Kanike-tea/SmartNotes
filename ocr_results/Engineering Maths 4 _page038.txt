NUMERICAL METHODS -! .

Consider the differential equation y’ = = = f(x,y) with a set of four pre

determined values of y:y (x) = Yor V(X) = Yyr Y(%_) = yy and y (x3) = yy.
Here Xy 4 Xq x3 are equally spaced values of x with width h.
Also X4 =x; +h = Xyt4h

Predictor and Corrector formulae to compute y ( x4) = yz are as follows.

Working procedure for problems

We first prepare the table showing the values of

c Y corrésponding to four
equidistant valites of x and the computation of y’ = f(x, y).

"| @. Weuse this value of Yq tocompute y,’ = f(x;, y,)

© We apply corrector formula to obtain the corrected value of Vg:

© _ This valie is used for computing yq° to apply the corrector formula again,
. The process is continued till we get consistency in two consecutive values of Ya:

Note : We can also find y,, yg ... by deducing expressions from the general form of the
predictor and corrector formulae.
