Review Questions

partitioned hashing, which is an extension of external hashing to deal with mul-
tiple keys. We also introduced grid files, which organize data into buckets along
multiple dimensions, We discussed the hash index in some detail—it is a second-
ary structure to access the file by using hashing on a search key other than that
used for the primary organization. Bitmap indexing is another important type of
indexing used for querying by multiple keys and is particularly applicable on fields
with a small number of unique values. Bitmaps can also be used at the leaf nodes of
B* tree indexes as well. We also discussed function-based indexing, which is being
provided by relational vendors to allow special indexes on a function of one or
more attributes.

We introduced the concept of a logical index and compared it with the physical
indexes we described before. They allow an additional level of indirection in index-
ing in order to permit greater freedom for movement of actual record locations on
disk. We discussed index creation in SQL, the process of bulk loading of index files
and indexing of strings. We discussed circumstances that point to tuning of indexes.
Then we reviewed some general topics related to indexing, including managing
constraints, using inverted indexes, and using indexing hints in queries; we com-
mented on column-based storage of relations, which is becoming a viable alterna-
tive for storing and accessing large databases. Finally, we discussed physical
database design of relational databases, which involves decisions related to storage
and accessing of data that we have been discussing in the current and the previous
chapter. This discussion was divided into factors that influence the design and the
types of decisions regarding whether to index an attribute, what attributes to
include in an index, clustered versus nonclustered indexes, hashed indexes, and
dynamic hashing.

Review Questions

17.1. Define the following terms: indexing field, primary key field, clustering field,
secondary key field, block anchor, dense index, and nondense (sparse) index.

17.2. Whatare the differences among primary, secondary, and clustering indexes?
How do these differences affect the ways in which these indexes are imple-
mented? Which of the indexes are dense, and which are not?

17.3. Why can we have at most one primary or clustering index on a file, but several
secondary indexes?

17.4. How does multilevel indexing improve the efficiency of searching an index file?
17.5. What is the order p of a B-tree? Describe the structure of B-tree nodes.

17.6. What is the order p of a B*-tree? Describe the structure of both internal and
leaf nodes of a B*-tree.

17.7. How does a B-tree differ from a B*-tree? Why is a B*-tree usually preferred
as an access structure to a data file?
