e Laminin: Laminin is a protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix and provides

structural support to cells in tissues such as skin, muscles, and organs. And
4) Regulating cell behaviour

e Receptor proteins: Receptor proteins are proteins that are located on the surface of
cells and bind to specific signaling molecules such as hormones, growth factors, and
neurotransmitters. When these molecules bind to the receptor, they trigger a cellular
response, such as a change in gene expression or the activation of an intracellular
signaling pathway.

e Enzymes: Enzymes are proteins that catalyze specific chemical reactions in the body.
Many enzymes are involved in regulating cellular behavior, such as kinases and
phosphatases that regulate protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation,
respectively.

e Cytoskeleton proteins: Cytoskeleton proteins, such as actin and tubulin, play a critical
role in regulating cell shape, movement, and division.

e Transcription factors: Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA and regulate
gene expression. They play a critical role in regulating cellular differentiation,
proliferation, and apoptosis.

e Adhesion proteins: Adhesion proteins are proteins that are involved in cell-to-cell and
cellto- matrix adhesion. They play a critical role in regulating cell behavior such as
cell migration, tissue development, and wound healing.

e lon channels: Ion channels are proteins that allow ions to move across the cell
membrane. They play a critical role in regulating cellular excitability and

communication.

Proteins are also involved in immune responses, hormone regulation, and muscle
contraction. The structure of a protein determines its function, and the sequence of amino acids
in a protein determines its structure.

There are 20 different types of amino acids, and the specific sequence of amino acids in a
protein determines its unique structure and function.

Proteins are synthesized by cells from the genetic information encoded in DNA. The process
of protein synthesis begins when the genetic code for a particular protein is transcribed into a
molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus and
into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein by ribosomes. Proteins play a critical
role in many biological processes, and their dysfunction is involved in the development of

many diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. Understanding the
