Basic SQL

T* SQL language may be considered one of the
major reasons for the commercial success of rela-
tional databases. Because it became a standard for relational databases, users were
less concerned about migrating their database applications from other types of
database systems—for example, older network or hierarchical systems—to rela-
tional systems. This is because even if the users became dissatisfied with the partic-
ular relational DBMS product they were using, converting to another relational
DBMS product was not expected to be too expensive and time-consuming because
both systems followed the same language standards. In practice, of course, there
are differences among various commercial relational DBMS packages. However,
if the user is diligent in using only those features that are part of the standard,
and if two relational DBMSs faithfully support the standard, then conversion
between two systems should be simplified. Another advantage of having such a
standard is that users may write statements in a database application program
that can access data stored in two or more relational DBMSs without having to
change the database sublanguage (SQL), as long as both/all of the relational
DBMSs support standard SQL.

This chapter presents the practical relational model, which is based on the SQL
standard for commercial relational DBMSs, whereas Chapter 5 presented the most
important concepts underlying the formal relational data model. In Chapter 8 (Sec-
tions 8.1 through 8.5 ), we shall discuss the relational algebra operations, which are
very important for understanding the types of requests that may be specified on a
relational database. They are also important for query processing and optimization
ina relational DBMS, as we shall see in Chapters 18 and 19. However, the relational
algebra operations are too low-level for most commercial DBMS users because a
query in relational algebra is written as a sequence of operations that, when exe-
cuted, produces the required result. Hence, the user must specify how—that is, in
what order—to execute the query operations. On the other hand, the SQL language
