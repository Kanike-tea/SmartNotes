Write Policy — WriteBack or WriteThrough
Writethrough

When the cache controller uses a writethrough policy, it writes to both cache and main memory
when there is a cache hit on write, ensuring that the cache and main memory stay coherent at all
times. Under this policy, the cache controller performs a write to main memory for each write to
cache memory. Because of the write to main memory, a write through policy is slower than a

writeback policy.
Writeback

When a cache controller uses a writeback policy, it writes to valid cache data memory and not to
main memory. Consequently, valid cache lines and main memory may contain different data.
The cache line holds the most recent data, and main memory contains older data, which has not

been updated.

Caches configured as writeback caches must use one or more of the dirty bits in the cache line
status information block. When a cache controller in writeback writes a value to cache memory,
it sets the dirty bit true. If the core accesses the cache line at a later time, it knows by the state of
the dirty bit that the cache line contains data not in main memory. If the cache controller evicts a

dirty cache line, it is automatically written out to main memory.

The controller does this to prevent the loss of vital information held in cache memory and not in

main memory
Cache Line Replacement Policy

On a cache miss, the cache controller must select a cache line from the available set in cache
memory to store the new information from main memory. The cache line selected for
replacement is known as a victim. If the victim contains valid, dirty data, the controller must
write the dirty data from the cache memory to main memory before it copies new data into the
victim cache line. The process of selecting and replacing a victim cache line is known as

eviction.
