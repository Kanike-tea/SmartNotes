° a: for ax’ ay" we obtain a system of twonon homogenous PDE of
the form $2 rere y); Sea g(x, Yy)>

© These can ts solved by direct nbs obtain the required v.
© The same procedure is adopted to find u given v.

¢ Further u+iv will give us f(z) asa function of x, y. .
Putting x = z, y= 0 wecanobtain f(z) as a function of Boe

uy = ~ Oxy — by i My = —6x - 6

> v= J (a2 3? + 6x) dy + f(x) ; v= J(6ay + 6y) ax + g(y)

v= Bry — y+ by + f(x) : v = 3x7 y + bxy'+ g(y)
Now we have to Properly choosef (x) ‘and g ( y)to Spargahige: expression pce
Simple comparison yields f(x) =0, g(y)= -¥~ :

(We look for functions of x only in the second expression of v and ago of y only in
the first expression of v )
