Database Management System [BCS403]

5.16

During transaction execution, all updates are applied to /oca/ copies of the data items

that are kept for the transaction

At the end of transaction execution, a validation phase checks whether any of the

transaction’s updates violate serializability.

There are three phases for this concurrency control protocol:

1. Read phase. A transaction can read values of committed data items from the
database. However, updates are applied only to local copies (versions) of the data
items kept in the transaction workspace.

2. Validation phase. Checking is performed to ensure that serializability will not be
violated if the transaction updates are applied to the database.

3. Write phase. If the validation phase is successful, the transaction updates are
applied to the database; otherwise, the updates are discarded and the transaction is
restarted.

The idea behind optimistic concurrency control is to do all the checks at once; hence,
transaction execution proceeds with a minimum of overhead until the validation phase is
reached
The techniques are called optimistic because they assume that little interference will
occur and hence that there is no need to do checking during transaction execution.
The validation phase for Ti checks that, for each such transaction 7j that is either
committed or is in its validation phase, one of the following conditions holds:
1. Transaction Tj completes its write phase before Ti starts its read phase.
2. Tistarts its write phase after Tj completes its write phase, and the read_set
of Ti has no items in common with the write_set of Tj.
3. Both the read_set and write_set of 7i have no items in common with the
write_set of 7j, and Tj completes its read phase before Ti completes its read
phase.

Granularity of Data Items and Multiple Granularity Locking

All concurrency control techniques assume that the database is formed of a number
of named data items. A database item could be chosen to be one of the following:

u A database record

uA field value of a database record

m A disk block

= A whole file
