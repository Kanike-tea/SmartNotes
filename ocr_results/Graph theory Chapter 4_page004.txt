Apply Kruskal’s algorithm to find a minimal spanning tree for the weighted
graph shown below. ;

Figure 4.7

> The given graph has 7 vertices and therefore a spanning tree thereof will have 6 edges. Le
us put the edges of the graph in a non-decreasing order of their weights and go on selecting
edges one by one in such a way that no cycle is created. The scheme is summarized below:
