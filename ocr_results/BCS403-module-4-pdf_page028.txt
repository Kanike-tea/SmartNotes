Database Management System [BCS403]

= Concurrent access is possible because of Multiprogramming. Multiprogramming can
be achieved by:
+ interleaved execution
+ Parallel Processing
= Multiprogramming operating systems execute some commands from one process,
then suspend that process and execute some commands from the next process, and so
on
= A process is resumed at the point where it was suspended whenever it gets its turn to
use the CPU again
= Hence, concurrent execution of processes is actually interleaved, as illustrated. in

Figure 21.1

= Figure 21.1, shows two processes, A and B, executing concurrently in an interleaved
fashion

= Interleaving keeps the CPU busy when a process requires an input or output (I/O)
operation, such as reading a block from disk

= The CPU is switched to execute another process rather than remaining idle during I/O
time

= Interleaving also prevents a long process from delaying other processes.

= If the computer system has multiple hardware processors (CPUs), parallel processing
of multiple processes is possible, as illustrated by processes C and D in Figure 21.1

= Most of the theory concerning concurrency control in databases is developed in terms of

interleaved concurrency
= In a multiuser DBMS, the stored data items are the primary resources that may be
accessed concurrently by interactive users or application programs, which are constantly

retrieving information from and modifying the database.
