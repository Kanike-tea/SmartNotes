5.4 Multiplication of Large Integers and Strassen‘s Matrix Multiplication 189

require five additions and one subtraction. Hence, we have the recurrence

A(n) =3A(n/2)+ en forn>1, AQ) =1.

Applying the Master Theorem, which was stated in the beginning of the chapter,
we obtain A(n) € @(n!°%23), which means that the total number of additions and
subtractions have the same asymptotic order of growth as the number of multipli-
cations.

The asymptotic advantage of this algorithm notwithstanding, how practical is
it? The answer depends, of course, on the computer system and program quality
implementing the algorithm, which might explain the rather wide disparity of
reported results. On some machines, the divide-and-conquer algorithm has been
reported to outperform the conventional method on numbers only 8 decimal digits
long and to run more than twice faster with numbers over 300 decimal digits
long—the area of particular importance for modern cryptography. Whatever this
outperformance “crossover point” happens to be on a particular machine, it is
worth switching to the conventional algorithm after the multiplicands become
smaller than the crossover point. Finally, if you program in an object-oriented
language such as Java,C++, or Smalltalk, you should also be aware that these
languages have special classes for dealing with large integers.

Discovered by 23-year-old Russian mathematician Anatoly Karatsuba in
1960, the divide-and-conquer algorithm proved wrong the then-prevailing opinion
that the time efficiency of any integer multiplication algorithm must be in Q(n7).
The discovery encouraged researchers to look for even (asymptotically) faster
algorithms for this and other algebraic problems. We will see such an algorithm
in the next section.

Strassen‘s'MatrixiMultiplication

Now that we have seen that the divide-and-conquer approach can reduce the
number of one-digit multiplications in multiplying two integers, we should not be
surprised that a similar feat can be accomplished for multiplying matrices. Such
an algorithm was published by V. Strassen in 1969 [Str69]. The principal insight
of the algorithm lies in the discovery that we can find the product C of two 2 x 2
matrices A and B with just seven multiplications as opposed to the eight required
by the brute-force algorithm (see Example 3 in Section 2.3). This is accomplished
by using the following formulas:

[x | _ [ae ao] « [im |

= my + mg m, +m3—m3+m6
