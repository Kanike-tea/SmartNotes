COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢834) Module 3

1. BASIC OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS:

The program to be executed is stored in memory. Instructions are accessed from memory to the
processor one by one and executed.
STEPS FOR INSTRUCTION EXECUTION
Consider the following instruction
Ex: 1 Add LOCA, Ro
This instruction is in the form of the following instruction format
Opcode Source, Destination
Where Add is the operation code, LOCA is the Memory operand and Ro is Register operand
This instruction adds the contents of memory location LOCA with the contents of Register Ro and
the result is stored in Ro Register.
The symbolic representation of this instruction is
Ro [LOCA] + [Ro]

The contents of memory location LOCA and Register Ro before and after the execution of this
instruction is as follows

Before instruction execution After instruction execution
LOCA = 23H LOCA = 23H
Ro = 22H Ro = 45H

The steps for instruction execution are as follows
1. Fetch the instruction from memory into the IR (instruction register in CPU).

2. Decode the instruction 1111000000 10011010

3. Access the Memory Operand

4. Access the Register Operand

5. Perform the operation according to the Operation Code.

6. Store the result into the Destination Memory location or Destination Register.

Ex:2 Add Ri, R2, R3

This instruction is in the form of the following instruction format
Opcode, Source-1, Source-2, Destination

Where R1 is Source Operand-1, R2 is the Source‘Operand-2 and R3, is the Destination. This
instruction adds the contents of Register R1 withthe contents of R2 and the result is placed in R3
Register.

The symbolic representation of this instruction is

R3<—R1] + [R2]
The contents of Registers R1,R2,R3 before and after the execution of this instruction is as follows.
Before instruction execution After instruction execution
R1 =24H R1 = 24H
R2 = 34H R2 = 34H
R3 = 38H R3 =58H
