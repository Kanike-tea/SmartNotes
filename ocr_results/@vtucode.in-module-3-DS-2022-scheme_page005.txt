DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

Doubly Linked List
1. The difficulties with single linked lists are that, it is possible to traversal only
in one direction, ie., direction of the links.
2. The only way to find the node that precedes p is to start at the beginning of the
list. The same problem arises when one wishes to delete an arbitrary node from

a singly linked list.Hence the solution is to use doubly linked list

Doubly linked list: It is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where each node
N isdivided into three parts:
1. An information field INFO which contains the data of N
2. A pointer field LLINK (FORW) which contains the location of the next node in
the list
3. A pointer field RLINK (BACK) which contains the location of the

preceding node inthe list

A node in a doubly linked list has at least three fields, a left link field (ink), a data
field (data), and a right link field (riink). The necessary declarations are:

typedef struct node *nodePointer;
typedef struct {
nodePointer lbink;
element data;
nodePointer rlink;
} node;
