Graph InsertVertex(graph,v):= return a graph with v inserted. v has no incident edges
Graph InsertEdge(graph,v1,v2) := retrun a graph with a new edge between v1 and v2
Graph DeleteVertex(graph,v) := return a graph in which v and all edges incident to it is
removed

Graph DeleteEdge(graph,v1,v2): retrun a graph in which the edge (v1,v2) is removed,

leave the incident nodes in the graph

Boolean IsEmpty:= If (graph == empty graph) retrun TRUE else Retrun
FALSE
List Adjacent(graph,v) := retrun a list of all vertices that are adjacent to v

Graph Representation
The three most commonly used representations are

e Adjacency Matrix
e Adjacency List
e Adjacency Multilist

Adjacency Matrix: Let G=(V,E) be a graph with n vertices, n>=1. The adjacency matrix of G is a
two dimensional n*n array for example a, with the property that a[i][j]=1 if there exist ane edge (i,j)
(for a directed graph edge <i,j> is in E(G).a[i][j]=0 if no such edge in G.

Example:
0 . 9

© The space requirement to store an adjacency matrix is n? bits.

e The adjacency matrix for a undirected graph is symmetric .About half the space can be saved
in an undirected graph by storing only the upper or lower triangle of the matrix.

e Foran undirected graph the degree of any vertex i is its row sum. For a directed graph the row
sum is the out-degree and the column sum is the in-degree.

Adjacency list: In adjacency matrix the n rows of the adjacency matrix are represented as n chains.
There is one chain for each vertex in G. The nodes in chain i represent the vertices that are adjacent
from vertex i. The data field of a chain node stores the index of an adjacent vertex.

Example: the adjacency list of graph G1 in figure 5.1 is shown below
