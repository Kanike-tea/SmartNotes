Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

alternative in Figure 3.8; we shall see in the next section that this will be refined into
a many-to-many relationship, once we introduce the concepts of relationships.

3.4 Relationship Types, Relationship Sets,
Roles, and Structural Constraints

In Figure 3.8 there are several implicit relationships among the various entity types.
In fact, whenever an attribute of one entity type refers to another entity type, some
relationship exists. For example, the attribute Manager of DEPARTMENT refers to
an employee who manages the department; the attribute Controlling_department
of PROJECT refers to the department that controls the project; the attribute
Supervisor of EMPLOYEE refers to another employee (the one who supervises this
employee); the attribute Department of EMPLOYEE refers to the department for
which the employee works; and so on. In the ER model, these references should not
be represented as attributes but as relationships. The initial COMPANY database
schema from Figure 3.8 will be refined in Section 3.6 to represent relationships
explicitly. In the initial design of entity types, relationships are typically captured in
the form of attributes. As the design is refined, these attributes get converted into
relationships between entity types.

This section is organized as follows: Section 3.4.1 introduces the concepts of rela-
tionship types, relationship sets, and relationship instances. We define the concepts
of relationship degree, role names, and recursive relationships in Section 3.4.2, and
then we discuss structural constraints on relationships—such as cardinality ratios
and existence dependencies—in Section 3.4.3. Section 3.4.4 shows how relationship
types can also have attributes.

3.4.1 Relationship Types, Sets, and Instances

A relationship type R among n entity types E,, Ey, ..., E,, defines a set of associa-
tions—or a relationship set—among entities from these entity types. Similar to the
case of entity types and entity sets, a relationship type and its corresponding rela-
tionship set are customarily referred to by the same name, R. Mathematically, the
relationship set R is a set of relationship instances r;, where each r; associates n
individual entities (¢, ¢,..., ¢,), and each entity ¢; in r; is a member of entity set Ej,
1 <j <n. Hence, a relationship set is a mathematical relation on E), E>,..., E,;
alternatively, it can be defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of the entity sets
E, x E,X...XxE,. Each of the entity types E, Ey, ..., E,, is said to participate in the
relationship type R; similarly, each of the individual entities e), 7, .. . , é,, is said to
participate in the relationship instance r; = (e), €2,...  €,)-

Informally, each relationship instance r; in R is an association of entities, where the
association includes exactly one entity from each participating entity type. Each
such relationship instance r; represents the fact that the entities participating in r;
are related in some way in the corresponding miniworld situation. For example,
consider a relationship type WORKS_FOR between the two entity types
