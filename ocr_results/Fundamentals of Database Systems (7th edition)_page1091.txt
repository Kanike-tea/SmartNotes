some hidden parameters. These hidden/unobserved parameters are the Dirichlet
distribution** priors for words and topics, topic distributions, and per-topic word dis-
tributions. Bayesian inference methods such as Gibbs sampling™ are used to fit
the hidden parameters based on the observed data (the words in the documents).

27.8.5 Question Answering Systems

Question answering (QA) has become a hot topic of study due to the surge in vir-
tual assistant technology (e.g., Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana). These virtual
assistant technologies are advancements in interactive voice response (IVR) sys-
tems, which primarily rely on speech recognition techniques such as keyword spot-
ting. Question answering deals with complex understanding of natural language
queries. Recently, IBM created history by developing the QA system called Watson,
that participated in the Jeopardy! Challenge*® and defeated human players in the
popular TV quiz show. Question answering has emerged as a practical engineering
discipline that comprises techniques such as parsing; named entity recognition
(NER); focus extraction; answer type extraction; relation extraction; ontological
inference; and search, indexing, and classification algorithms. Question answering
techniques also involve knowledge engineering from large unstructured corpora
such as Web document collections and structured databases that incorporate
knowledge from various domains. These document collections are generally large
enough to require application of big data tools and technologies, some of which we
discussed in Chapter 25. In the following sections, we consider the main concepts
involved in question answering.

Types of Questions: In question answering systems, it is important to know the
category or type of question, because answering strategies rely heavily on the type
of questions. Some of these categories are not always mutually exclusive and hence
require hybrid answering strategies. Generally, questions can be categorized into
the following types:

Factoid Questions: This type of question pinpoints the right phrase in a docu-
ment or a database that correctly addresses the question. Examples of this type
include questions such as, “Who is the president of the United States?”, “In
which city was Elvis Presley born?”, ‘Where is Hartsfield Jackson International
Airport located?’, and “At what time will today’s sunset occur?”.

List Questions: This type of question seeks a list of factoid responses that sat-
isfy a given criterion. Examples include “Name three plays that were written by
Shakespeare”, “Name the male actors who played the role of James Bond in the
James Bond 007 movie series”, and “List three red-colored vegetables”.
