¢ The staring address to ISR is called the interrupt vector.
« Processor
— loads interrupt-vector into PC &
— executes appropriate ISR.
« When processor is ready to receive interrupt-vector code, it activates INTA line.

¢ Then, I/O-device responds by sending its interrupt-vector code & turning off the
INTR signal.

¢ The interrupt vector also includes a new value for the Processor Status Register

INTERRUPT NESTING

¢ A multiple-priority scheme is implemented by using separate INTR & INTA lines for
each device

¢ Each INTR line is assigned a different priority-level as shown in Figure.

Processor

Priority

« Each device has a separate interrupt-request and interrupt-acknowledge line.
¢ Each interrupt-request line is assigned a different priority level.

¢ Interrupt requests received over these lines are sent to a priority arbitration circuit
in the processor.

¢ If the interrupt request has a higher priority level than the priority of the processor,
then the request is accepted.

¢ Priority-level of processor is the priority of program that is currently being executed.

¢ Processor accepts interrupts only from devices that have higher-priority than its
own.
