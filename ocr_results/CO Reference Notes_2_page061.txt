ADDITION OF POSITIVE NUMBERS
1) Consider adding two 1-bit numbers.
2) The sum of 1 & 1 requires the 2-bit vector 10 to represent the value 2. We say that sum is 0 and the
carry-out is 1.

0 1 0 1
+0 + 0 +1 71
0 1 1 10

ADDITION & SUBTRACTION OF SIGNED NUMBERS
¢ Following are the two rules for addition and subtraction of n-bit signed numbers using the 2's
complement representation system (Figure 1.6).
Rule 1:
> To Add two numbers, add their n-bits and ignore the carry-out signal from the MSB position.
> Result will be algebraically correct, if it lies in the range 20-1 to42m-ly,
Rule 2:
> To Subtract two numbers X and Y (that is to perform X-Y), take the 2's complement of Y and
then add it to X as in rule 1.
> Result will be algebraically correct, if it lies in the range cam-ly to +211),
. When the result of an arithmetic operation is outside the representable-range, an arithmetic
overflow is said to occur.
. To represent a signed in 2's complement form using a larger number of bits, repeat the sign
bit as many times as needed to the left. This operation is called sign extension.
. In 1's complement representation, the result obtained after an addition operation is not always
correct. The carry-out(cn) cannot be ignored. If cn=0, the result obtained is correct. If cn=1, then a 1 must
be added to the result to make it correct.

OVERFLOW IN INTEGER ARITHMETIC
© When result of an arithmetic operation is outside the represent able-range, an arithmetic overflow
is said to occur.
. For example: If we add two numbers +7 and +4, then the output sum S is
1011(€0111+0100), which is the code for -5, an incorrect result.
* An overflow occurs in following 2 cases
1) Overflow can occur only when adding two numbers that have the same sign.
2) The carry-out signal from the sign-bit position is not a sufficient indicator of overflow when
adding signed numbers.
