REGISTER TRANSFERS

1)

2)

¢ Instruction execution involves a sequence of steps in which data are transferred
from one register to another.

¢ For each register, two control-signals are used: Riin & Riout. These are called
Gating Signals.

¢ Riin=1 0 data on bus is loaded into Ri. Riout=1

(1 content of Ri is placed on bus.

Riout=0, 1 bus can be used for transferring data from other registers.

¢ For example, Move R1, R2; This transfers the contents of register R1 to register R2.
This can be accomplished as follows:

Enable the output of registers R1 by setting Rlout to 1 (Figure 7.2). This places the
contents of R1 on processor-bus.

Enable the input of register R2 by setting R2out to 1.

This loads data from processor-bus into register R4.

All operations and data transfers within the processor take place within time-
periods defined by the

processor-clock.
