Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems

Redis key-value cache and store. Redis differs from the other systems dis-
cussed here because it caches its data in main memory to further improve perfor-
mance. It offers master-slave replication and high availability, and it also offers
persistence by backing up the cache to disk.

Apache Cassandra. Cassandra is a NOSQL system that is not easily categorized
into one category; it is sometimes listed in the column-based NOSQL category (see
Section 24.5) or in the key-value category. If offers features from several NOSQL
categories and is used by Facebook as well as many other customers.

24.5 Column-Based or Wide Column
NOSQL Systems

Another category of NOSQL systems is known as column-based or wide column
systems. The Google distributed storage system for big data, known as BigTable, is
a well-known example of this class of NOSQL systems, and it is used in many
Google applications that require large amounts of data storage, such as Gmail. Big-
Table uses the Google File System (GFS) for data storage and distribution. An
open source system known as Apache Hbase is somewhat similar to Google Big-
Table, but it typically uses HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for data stor-
age. HDFS is used in many cloud computing applications, as we shall discuss in
Chapter 25. Hbase can also use Amazon’s Simple Storage System (known as $3)
for data storage. Another well-known example of column-based NOSQL systems is
Cassandra, which we discussed briefly in Section 24.4.3 because it can also be char-
acterized as a key-value store. We will focus on Hbase in this section as an example
of this category of NOSQL systems.

BigTable (and Hbase) is sometimes described as a sparse multidimensional distrib-
uted persistent sorted map, where the word map means a collection of (key, value)
pairs (the key is mapped to the value). One of the main differences that distinguish
column-based systems from key-value stores (see Section 24.4) is the nature of the
key. In column-based systems such as Hbase, the key is multidimensional and so
has several components: typically, a combination of table name, row key, column,
and timestamp. As we shall see, the column is typically composed of two compo-
nents: column family and column qualifier. We discuss these concepts in more
detail next as they are realized in Apache Hbase.

24.5.1 Hbase Data Model and Versioning

Hbase data model. The data model in Hbase organizes data using the concepts
of namespaces, tables, column families, column qualifiers, columns, rows, and data
cells. A column is identified by a combination of (column family:column qualifier).
Data is stored in a self-describing form by associating columns with data values,
where data values are strings. Hbase also stores multiple versions of a data item,
with a timestamp associated with each version, so versions and timestamps are also
