Therefore, the number of binary trees with n nodes, the number of permutations of 1 to n

obtainable with a stack, and the number of ways to multiply n + 1 matrices are all equal.
4.5.4 Number of Distinct binary trees

To obtain the number of distinct binary trees with n nodes, we must solve the recurrence
a-t
b, bad > b, Dy ant ni and by =1
“0

To begin we let:
Bix) =F dx!
i20

which is the generating function for the number of binary trees. Next observe that by the

recurrence relation we get the identity:
xB? (x) = B(x) - 1

Using the formula to solve quadratics and the recurrence that B (0) = b= 1 we get:

Boje

We can use the binomial theorem to expand (1 - 4x) "* to obtain:
ip 12
Bix) = 5 f Z| “y caer

*Eln+1) (-1)" 28+! 9

we see that by which is the coefficient of x" in B(x), is:
12 *
