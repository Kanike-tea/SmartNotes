Consider a bipartite graph G = G(V;, V2; E), where V; and V> are as usual the two partitions
(bipartites) of the vertex set of the graph G, and E is the edge set of G. In this graph, every
edge has one end vertex in V; and the other end vertex in V2.

A subset M of E is called a matching in G if no two edges that belong to M share a common
vertex in V; or V>.

A matching M in G is called a complete matching from V; to V2 if every vertex in V, is an
end vertex of some edge that belongs to M.

For example, consider the bipartite graph shown in Figure 4.53.

(ii) A minimal covering is a graph covering in which removal of an edge

destroys the property. The set V2 in the above graph is a minimal cover of
the given graph.
