Preface

ik book introduces the fundamental concepts
necessary for designing, using, and implementing
database systems and database applications. Our presentation stresses the funda-
mentals of database modeling and design, the languages and models provided by the
database management systems, and database system implementation techniques.
The book is meant to be used as a textbook for a one- or two-semester course in
database systems at the junior, senior, or graduate level, and as a reference book. Our
goal is to provide an in-depth and up-to-date presentation of the most important
aspects of database systems and applications, and related technologies. We assume
that readers are familiar with elementary programming and data-structuring con-
cepts and that they have had some exposure to the basics of computer organization.

New to This Edition
The following key features have been added in the seventh edition:

= A reorganization of the chapter ordering (this was based on a survey of the
instructors who use the textbook); however, the book is still organized so
that the individual instructor can choose to follow the new chapter ordering
or choose a different ordering of chapters (for example, follow the chapter
order from the sixth edition) when presenting the materials.

= There are two new chapters on recent advances in database systems and big
data processing; one new chapter (Chapter 24) covers an introduction to the
newer class of database systems known as NOSQL databases, and the other
new chapter (Chapter 25) covers technologies for processing big data,
including MapReduce and Hadoop.

= The chapter on query processing and optimization has been expanded and
reorganized into two chapters; Chapter 18 focuses on strategies and algo-
rithms for query processing whereas Chapter 19 focuses on query optimiza-
tion techniques.

= Asecond UNIVERSITY database example has been added to the early chap-
ters (Chapters 3 through 8) in addition to our COMPANY database example
from the previous editions.

= Many of the individual chapters have been updated to varying degrees to include
newer techniques and methods; rather than discuss these enhancements here,
