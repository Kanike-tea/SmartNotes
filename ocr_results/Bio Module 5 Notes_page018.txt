Laser-assisted bioprinting utilizes laser energy to precisely deposit bioinks onto a
substrate. The bioink is placed on an energy-absorbing layer, and the laser creates a pressure
wave that propels the bioink onto the substrate in a controlled manner. This technique offers high
resolution, precision, and the ability to print complex structures. It can be used with delicate
bioinks and allows for cell viability. However, laser-assisted bioprinting can be relatively slow
and may have limitations in terms of bioink viscosity.

Microvalve-based Bioprinting:

Microvalve-based bioprinting employs microvalves to control the deposition of bioinks.
The bioink is pushed through microchannels, and the microvalves open and close to release the
bioink precisely. This technique provides control over droplet size, deposition speed, and spatial
accuracy. It is suitable for a variety of bioink viscosities and can achieve high cell viability.

However, the complexity of the system and the need for careful calibration can be limitations.

Bioprinting with Solid Freeform Fabrication:

Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) combines bioprinting with traditional 3D printing
methods. It involves the deposition of both bioink and supporting materials to create complex,
multi-material structures. SFF techniques such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) or
stereolithography (SLA) can be adapted to include bioinks and allow for the incorporation of
living cells. This approach provides versatility in material selection and structural design but may
require additional post-processing steps to remove supporting materials.
