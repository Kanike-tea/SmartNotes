. Harmonic property ;

The real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are harmonic.

Proof : We shall prove the result separately for the cartesian and polar form ofz.

Cartesian form

Let f(z) = u(x, y)+iv(x, y) be analytic. We chall show that u and v satisfy

Since f(z) isanalytic we have Cauchy-Riemann equations
