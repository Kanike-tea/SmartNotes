Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module IV

Example:

Cc D
(B,C),(C,D) is a path from B to D the length of the path is 2

A simple path is a path in which all the vertices are distinct.

Cycle: A cycle is a simple path in which all the vertices except the first and last vertices are distinct.
The first and the last vertices are same.

Example :

(B,C),(C,D)(D,E)(E,A)(A.B) is a cycle

Degree of a vertex : Ina undirected graph degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on a
vertex.

Ina directed graph the in-degree if a vertex v is the number of edges for which v is the head i.e. the

number of edges that are coming into a vertex. The out degree is defined as the number of edges for
which v is the tail i.e. the number of edges that are going out of a vertex

Subgraph: A subgraph of G is a graph G’ such that V(G’) < V(G) and E(G’) c E(G)
Example :

A E A |
: <|[|
e D ° 2
Graph(G) Subgraph(G’)
Connected Graph: An undirected graph G is said to be connected if for every pair of distinct
vertices u and v in V(G) there is a path from u to v in G.

Connected Component is a maximal connected subgraph

Strongly connected graph : A directed graph G is said to be strongly connected if for every pair of
distinct vertices u an v in V(G), there is a directed path from u to v and from v to u.

Tree: A tree is a connected acyclic connected graph.
ADT Graph

Objects: a nonempty set of vertices and a set of undirected edges, where each edge is a pair of
vertices.

Functions: for all graphe Graph, v,v1,v2 € vertices
