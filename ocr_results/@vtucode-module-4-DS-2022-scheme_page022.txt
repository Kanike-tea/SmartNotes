5.2.4 Spanning Trees

A spanning tree is any tree that consists solely of edges in G and that includes all the vertices
in G.

A complete graph and three of its spanning trees

we may use either dfs or bfs to create aspanning tree. When dfs is used, the resulting spanning
tree is known as a depth first spanning tree. When bfs is used, the resulting spanning tree is
called a breadth first spanning tree.
