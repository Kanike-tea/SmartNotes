578 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

= If Rdis po, then the instruction effects a jump to the calculated address. If the operation

updates the cpsr, then the processor mode must have an spsr; in this case, the cpsr is set
to the value of the spsr.

= If Rn or Rmis pc, then the value used is the address of the instruction plus eight bytes.

Examples

BIC 0, r0, #1<<22 3 clear bit 22 of r0

BKPT Breakpoint instruction
1. BKPT <immed16> ARMv5,
2.  BKPT <immed8> THUMBv2
The breakpoint instruction causes a prefetch data abort, unless overridden by debug
hardware. The ARM ignores the immediate value. This immediate can be used to hold
debug information such as the breakpoint number.
BL Relative branch with link (subroutine call)

1. BL<cond> <address25> ARMv1
2. BL <address22> THUMBV1
Action Effect on the cpsr

1. Ir = ret#0; pc = <address25> None

2. Ir = ret+l; pe = <address22> None

Note

= These instructions set /r to the address of the following instruction ret plus the current

cpsr T-bit setting. Therefore you can return from the subroutine using BX 1r to resume
execution address and ARM or Thumb state.

Examples

BL subroutine ; call subroutine (return with MOV pc,1r)
BLVS overflow call subroutine on an overflow
