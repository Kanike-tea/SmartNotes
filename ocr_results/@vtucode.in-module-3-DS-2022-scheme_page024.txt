DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

When trees are represented in memory, it should be able to distinguish between threads and
pointers. This can be done by adding two additional fields to node structure, ie., leftThread
and rightThread

If ptr—leftThread = TRUE, then ptr—leftChild contains a thread, otherwise it contains
a pointer to the left child.

If ptr—rightThread = TRUE, then ptr—rightChild contains a thread, otherwise it contains
a pointer to the right child.

Node Structure:

The node structure is given in C declaration

typedef struct threadTree *threadPointer
typedef struct{
short int leftThread; threadPointer
leftChild;
char data;
threadPointer rightChild;
short int rightThread;
}threadTree;

left_thread left_child data right_child right_thread

Figure An empty threaded tree

The complete memory representation for the tree of figure is shown in Figure C
The variable root points to the header node of the tree, while root —leftChild points
to the start of the first node of the actual tree. This is true for all threaded trees. Here the

problem of the loose threads is handled by pointing to the head node called root.
