30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security

make the complete name unique. Authorizing this identity and managing the
schema of these identities is called identity management. Identity management
addresses how organizations can effectively authenticate people and manage their
access to confidential information. It has become more visible as a business require-
ment across all industries affecting organizations of all sizes. Identity management
administrators constantly need to satisfy application owners while keeping expen-
ditures under control and increasing IT efficiency.

Another important consideration in RBAC systems is the possible temporal con-
straints that may exist on roles, such as the time and duration of role activations
and the timed triggering of a role by an activation of another role. Using an RBAC
model is a highly desirable goal for addressing the key security requirements of
Web-based applications. Roles can be assigned to workflow tasks so that a user with
any of the roles related to a task may be authorized to execute it and may play a
certain role only for a certain duration.

RBAC models have several desirable features, such as flexibility, policy neutrality,
better support for security management and administration, and a natural enforce-
ment of the hierarchical organization structure within organizations. They also
have other aspects that make them attractive candidates for developing secure
Web-based applications. These features are lacking in DAC and MAC models.
RBAC models do include the capabilities available in traditional DAC and MAC
policies. Furthermore, an RBAC model provides mechanisms for addressing the
security issues related to the execution of tasks and workflows, and for specifying
user-defined and organization-specific policies. Easier deployment over the Inter-
net has been another reason for the success of RBAC models.

30.3.3 Label-Based Security and Row-Level Access Control

Many mainstream RDBMSs currently use the concept of row-level access control,
where sophisticated access control rules can be implemented by considering the
data row by row. In row-level access control, each data row is given a label, which
is used to store information about data sensitivity. Row-level access control pro-
vides finer granularity of data security by allowing the permissions to be set for
each row and not just for the table or column. Initially the user is given a default
session label by the database administrator. Levels correspond to a hierarchy of
data-sensitivity levels to exposure or corruption, with the goal of maintaining pri-
vacy or security. Labels are used to prevent unauthorized users from viewing or
altering certain data. A user having a low authorization level, usually represented
by alow number, is denied access to data having a higher-level number. If no such
label is given to a row, a row label is automatically assigned to it depending upon
the user’s session label.

A policy defined by an administrator is called a label security policy. Whenever
data affected by the policy is accessed or queried through an application, the policy
is automatically invoked. When a policy is implemented, a new column is added to
each row in the schema. The added column contains the label for each row that
