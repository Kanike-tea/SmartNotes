128 Summary 459

There are two policies available when writing data to cache memory. If the controller
only updates cache memory, it is a writeback policy. If the cache controller writes to both
the cache and main memory, it is a writethrough policy.

There are two policies a cache controller uses to allocate a cache line on a cache
miss. A read-allocate policy allocates a cache line when data is read from main memory.
A write-allocate policy allocates a cache line on a write to main memory.

ARM uses the term clean to mean forcing a copyback of data in the D-cache to main
memory. ARM uses the term flush to mean invalidating the contents of a cache.

Cache lockdown is a feature provided by some ARM cores. The lockdown feature allows
code and data to be loaded into cache and marked as exempt from eviction.

We also provided example code showing how to clean and flush ARM cached cores, and
to lock code and data in cache.
