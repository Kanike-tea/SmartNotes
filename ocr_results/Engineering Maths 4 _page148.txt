: - Differentiability.: A complex valued function f(z) is said to be differentiable at

F(2)-f (2p)

252 if lim , > exists and is unique. This limit when exists is called the

derivative of f2), fat v2 Zo, and is denoted by f(a).

Suppose we write iz = = Z-Z,, then z 2% implies that §z 0
f(%+8z)-f(%)

Hence, f'(%) =. lim bz

Further f(z) is said to be continuous / differentiable in a domain or a region D if
f(z) is continuous / differentiable at every point of D.

_ . These definitions are analogous with the definitions of a yeal valued function.

_. A complex valued function w = f(z) is said to be analytic at a point z= Zs if

wey (z) = It f(z+5z)-f(z)

3 exists and is tanane at z and in the

“neighbourhood of zy. Further f(z) is said to be analytic in a region if itis Seay

at every point of the region.

. Analytic functionisalso called a regular function or holomorphic function. We can as well

say that f(z) is analytic at a point z, if it is differentiable at z) and in the
neighbourhood of Zp.

Theorem-1 [Cauchy-Riemann equations in the cartesian form]

Thenectsonry condone that the function w=f(z)=u(x,y)t+iv(x, y) may
