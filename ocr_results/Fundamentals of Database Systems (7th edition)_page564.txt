534 Chapter 15 Relational Database Design Algorithms and Further Dependencies

the database designer. The relational decomposition algorithms (such as Algo-
rithms 15.5 and 15.6) create BCNF (or 4NF) relations by successive nonadditive
decomposition of unnormalized relations into two component relations at a time.
We saw that it is possible to synthesize 3NF relation schemas that meet both of the
above properties; however, in the case of BCNF, it is possible to aim only for the
nonadditiveness of joins—dependency preservation cannot be necessarily guaran-
teed. If the designer has to aim for one of these two, the nonadditive join condition
is an absolute must. In Section 15.4 we showed how certain difficulties arise in a
collection of relations due to null values that may exist in relations in spite of the
relations being individually in 3NF or BCNF. Sometimes when decomposition is
improperly carried too far, certain “dangling tuples” may result that do not par-
ticipate in results of joins and hence may become invisible. We also showed how
algorithms such as 15.4 for 3NF synthesis could lead to alternative designs based
on the choice of minimum cover. We revisited multivalued dependencies (MVDs)
in Section 15.5. MVDs arise from an improper combination of two or more inde-
pendent multivalued attributes in the same relation, and MVDs result in a combi-
national expansion of the tuples used to define fourth normal form (4NF). We
discussed inference rules applicable to MVDs and discussed the importance of
ANF. Finally, in Section 15.6 we discussed inclusion dependencies, which are used
to specify referential integrity and class/subclass constraints, and pointed out the
need for arithmetic functions or more complex procedures to enforce certain
functional dependency constraints. We concluded with a brief discussion of the
domain-key normal form (DKNF).

Review Questions

15.1. What is the role of Armstrong’s inference rules (inference rules IR1 through
IR3) in the development of the theory of relational design?

15.2. What is meant by the completeness and soundness of Armstrong's infer-
ence rules?

15.3. What is meant by the closure of a set of functional dependencies? Illustrate
with an example.

15.4. When are two sets of functional dependencies equivalent? How can we
determine their equivalence?

15.5. What is a minimal set of functional dependencies? Does every set of depen-
dencies have a minimal equivalent set? Is it always unique?

15.6. What is meant by the attribute preservation condition on a decomposition?

15.7. Why are normal forms alone insufficient as a condition for a good schema
design?

15.8. What is the dependency preservation property for a decomposition? Why is
it important?
