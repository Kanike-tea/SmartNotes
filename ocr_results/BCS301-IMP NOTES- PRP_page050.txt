P11 =Probability of using bike on a day, given that bike has been used on the previous day=0
(Because bike is not used on two consecutive days)

P12 =Probability of using car on a day, given that the bike has been used on the previous day=1
(Because it is certain that car is used on a day if bike is used on the previous day)

P21 =Probability of using bike on a day, given that car is used on the previous day= V2
(Because using car or bike on a day are equally likely if car is used on the previous day)

P22 =Probability of using car on a day, given that car is used on the previous day=1/2

Therefore, on the fifth day the probability of using the bike is p,“) = = , the probability of

using the car is p, = =

7) Aman’s smoking habits are as follows. If he smokes filter cigarettes one week, he switches to non-
filter cigarettes the next week with the probability 0.2. On the other hand, if he smokes non filter
cigarettes one week there is a probability of 0.7that he will smoke non filter cigarettes the next
week as well. In the long run how often does he smoke filter cigarettes?

Let A= Smoking filter cigarettes B= Smoking non filter cigarettes
Therefore, the associated transition probability matrix is as follows

Thus, in the long run, he will smoke filter cigarettes = or 60% of the time.
