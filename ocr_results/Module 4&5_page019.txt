Microcontrollers - BCS402

Debug capabiliy is provided in the form of a module or monitor that provides software assistance

for debugging code running on a hardware target. This assistance includes the following:

e Setting up breakpoints in RAM. A breakpoint allows a program to be interrupted and the
state of the processor core to be examined.

e Listing and modifying memory (using peek and poke operations).

e Showing current processor register contents.

e Disassembling memory into ARM and Thumb instruction mnemonics.

These are interactive functions: One can either send the commands through a command line
interpreter (CLI) or through a dedicated host debugger attached to the target platform. Unless the
firmware has access to the internal hardware debug circuitry, only RAM images can be

debugged through a software debug mechanism.

The second stage is to abstract the hardware. The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is a
software layer that hides the underlying hardware by providing a set of defined programming
interfaces. When you move to a new target platform, these programming interfaces remain

constant but the underlying implementation changes.

The HAL software that communicates with specific hardware peripherals is called a device
driver. A device driver provides a standard application programming interface (API) to read and

write to a specific peripheral.

The third stage is to load a bootable image. The ability of firmware to carry out this activity
depends upon the type of media used to store the image. Note that not all operating system
images or application images need to be copied into RAM. The operating system image or

application image can simply execute directly from ROM.
3.2 ARM Firmware Suite

ARM has developed a firmware package called the ARM Firmware Suite (AFS). AFS is
designed purely for ARM-based embedded systems. It provides support for a number of boards

and processors including the Intel XScale and StrongARM processors.

The package includes two major pieces of technology,
