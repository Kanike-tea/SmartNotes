enables users to navigate a multi-dimensional information space. Facets are gener-
ally used for handling three or more dimensions of classification. These multiple
dimensions of classification allow the faceted classification scheme to classify an
object in various ways based on different taxonomical criteria. For example, a Web
page may be classified in various ways: by content (airlines, music, news, etc.); by
use (sales, information, registration, etc.); by location; by language used (HTML,
XML, etc.); and in other ways or facets. Hence, the object can be classified in mul-
tiple ways based on multiple taxonomies.

A facet defines properties or characteristics of a class of objects. The properties
should be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. For example, a collection of art objects
might be classified using an artist facet (name of artist), an era facet (when the art
was created), a type facet (painting, sculpture, mural, etc.), a country of origin facet,
a media facet (oil, watercolor, stone, metal, mixed media, etc.), a collection facet
(where the art resides), and so on.

Faceted search uses faceted classification, which enables a user to navigate informa-
tion along multiple paths corresponding to different orderings of the facets. This
contrasts with traditional taxonomies, in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed
and unchanging. University of California—Berkeley’s Flamenco project* is one of
the earlier examples of a faceted search system. Most e-commerce sites today, such
as Amazon or Expedia, use faceted search in their search interfaces to quickly com-
pare and navigate various aspects related to search criteria.

27.8.2 Social Search

The traditional view of Web navigation and browsing assumes that a single user is
searching for information. This view contrasts with previous research by library
scientists who studied users’ information-seeking habits. This research demon-
strated that additional individuals may be valuable information resources during
information search by a single user. More recently, research indicates that there is
often direct user cooperation during Web-based information search. Some studies
report that significant segments of the user population are engaged in explicit col-
laboration on joint search tasks on the Web. Active collaboration by multiple par-
ties also occurs in certain cases (for example, enterprise settings); at other times,
and perhaps for a majority of searches, users often interact with others remotely,
asynchronously, and even involuntarily and implicitly.

Socially enabled online information search (social search) is a new phenomenon
facilitated by recent Web technologies. Collaborative social search involves different
ways for active involvement in search-related activities such as co-located search,
remote collaboration on search tasks, use of social network for search, use of expertise
networks, use of social data mining or collective intelligence to improve the search
process, and use of social interactions to facilitate information seeking and sense
making. This social search activity may be done synchronously, asynchronously,
