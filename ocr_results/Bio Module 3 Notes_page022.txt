respiratory failure, which can occur as a result of a variety of conditions such as pneumonia,
severe asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

There are several different types of ventilators, including volume-controlled ventilators,
pressure-controlled ventilators, and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) devices. The type
of ventilator used depends on the patient's individual needs and the type of respiratory failure being
treated.

Ventilators work by delivering pressurized air or oxygen into the lungs through a_ breathing
tube or mask. The pressure can be adjusted to match the patient's needs and to help maintain
adequate oxygen levels in the blood.

While ventilators can be lifesaving for individuals with acute respiratory failure, they also
come with potential risks and complications. For example, prolonged use of a ventilator can increase
the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and patients may experience discomfort or pain from
the breathing tube.

The use of ventilators is carefully monitored and managed by healthcare professionals to
ensure that the patient receives the appropriate level of support while minimizing potential risks and
complications.

Heart-Lung Machine

A heart-lung machine, also known as a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, is a device
used in cardiovascular surgery to temporarily take over the functions of the heart and lungs. The
heart-lung machine is used during open-heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
surgery and valve replacement surgery, to support the patient's circulatory and respiratory functions
while the heart is stopped.
