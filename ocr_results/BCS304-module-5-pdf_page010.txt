5.0.6 Priority Queues
1 Single and Double- ended priority queues

The single ended priority queues may be categorized as min and max priority queues.The operations

supported by a min priority queue are:

SP1: Return an element with minimum priority.

SP2: Insert an element with an arbitrary priority.
SP3: Delete an element with minimum priority.

The operations supported by a max priority queue are the same as those supported by a min priority queue
except that in SP] and SP3 we replace minimum by maximum. The heap structure is a classical data
structure for the representation of a priority queue. Using a min (max) heap, the minimum (maximum)
element can be found in O(1) time. Meldable (single- ended) priority queue, augments the operations SP1

through SP3 with a meld operation that melds together two priority queues.

A double-ended priority queue (DEPQ) is a data structure that supports the following opertions on a

collection of elements.
