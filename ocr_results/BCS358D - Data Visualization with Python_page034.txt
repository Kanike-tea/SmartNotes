11. It iterates over each character (i) in the string representation of the number (n). For each
character, it checks if it already exists as a key in the dictionary s. If it does, it increments
the corresponding value by 1. If it doesn't, it adds the character as a key in the dictionary

with a value of 1.
12. Finally, the program prints the number of occurrences of each digit in the input number

by displaying the contents of the dictionary s.
The program provides various functionalities such as reversing a number, checking if it is a
palindrome, finding the number of digits, and counting the occurrences of each digit in the input
number. It demonstrates the usage of loops, conditionals, string conversions, and dictionaries in
Python
PROGRAM

rev 0
num = int (input ("Enter the number:") )

temp = num
n=str (temp)

while num > 0:
digit = num%10

rev = rev*l0+digit
num //= 10
print ("Given Number is", temp)
print ("Reversed Number is", rev)
if temp == rev:
print(temp, "is a Palindrome")
else:
print(temp, "is not a Palindrome")

# Finding Number of Digits using built-in function
print ("Number of Digits using Built-in Function: ", len(str(n)))

#Finding the occurrences of each digit
s={}
for i inn:
if iins:
s[i]+=1
else:
s[i]=1
print ("Number of occurrences of each digit in the input number are:")
print (s)
