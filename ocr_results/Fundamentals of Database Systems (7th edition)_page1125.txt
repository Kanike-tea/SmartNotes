28.7 Commercial Data Mining Tools

Windows environment. One tool, Data Surveyor, mentions ODMG compliance;
see Chapter 12, where we discussed the ODMG object-oriented standard.

In general, these programs perform sequential processing in a single machine.
Many of these products work in the client/server mode. Some products incorporate
parallel processing in parallel computer architectures and work as a part of online
analytical processing (OLAP) tools.

28.7.1 User Interface

Most of the tools run in a graphical user interface (GUI) environment. Some prod-
ucts include sophisticated visualization techniques to view data and rules (for
example, SGI’s MineSet), and are even able to manipulate data this way interac-
tively. Text interfaces are rare and are more common in tools available for UNIX,
such as IBM’s Intelligent Miner.

28.7.2 Application Programming Interface

Usually, the application programming interface (API) is an optional tool. Most
products do not permit using their internal functions. However, some of them
allow the application programmer to reuse their code. The most common inter-
faces are C libraries and dynamic link libraries (DLLs). Some tools include propri-
etary database command languages.

Table 28.1 lists 11 representative data mining tools. To date, there are hundreds of
commercial data mining products available worldwide. Non-U.S. products include
Data Surveyor from the Netherlands and PolyAnalyst from Russia.

28.7.3 Future Directions

Data mining tools are continually evolving, building on ideas from the latest scien-
tific research. Many of these tools incorporate the latest algorithms taken from arti-
ficial intelligence (Al), statistics, and optimization. Currently, fast processing is
done using modern database techniques—such as distributed processing—in cli-
ent/server architectures, in parallel databases, and in data warehousing. For the
future, the trend is toward developing Internet capabilities more fully. Additionally,
hybrid approaches will become commonplace, and processing will be done using
all resources available. Processing will take advantage of both parallel and distrib-
uted computing environments. This shift is especially important because modern
databases contain very large amounts of information.

The primary direction for data mining is to analyze terabytes and petabytes of data
in the so-called big data systems that we presented in Chapter 25. These systems are
being equipped with their own tools and libraries for data mining, such as Mahout,
which runs on top of Hadoop, which we described in detail. The data mining area
will also be closely tied to data that will be housed in the cloud in data warehouses
