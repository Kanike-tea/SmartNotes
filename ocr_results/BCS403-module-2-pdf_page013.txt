3. Set null or set default - is to modify the referencing attribute values that cause the violation;

each such value is either set to NULL or changed to reference another default valid tuple.

1.3.3 The Update Operation
The Update (or Modify) operation is used to change the values of one or more attributes in a tuple
(or tuples) of some relation R. It is necessary to specify a condition on the attributes of the relation
to select the tuple (or tuples) to be modified.
Examples:
1. Operation:
Update the salary of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = *999887777° to 28000.
Result: Acceptable.
2. Operation:
Update the Dno of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777" to 7.
Result: Unacceptable, because it violates referential integrity.
3. Operation:
Update the Ssn of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777° to ‘987654321’.
Result: Unacceptable, because it violates primary key constraint by repeating a value
that already exists as a primary key in another tuple; it violates referential integrity
constraints because there are other relations that refer to the existing value of Ssn
Updating an attribute that is neither part of a primary key nor of a foreign key usually causes no
problems; the DBMS need only check to confirm that the new value is of the correct data type and

domain.

1.3.4 The Transaction Concept

A transaction is an executing program that includes some database operations, such as reading from
the database, or applying insertions, deletions, or updates to the database. At the end of the
transaction, it must leave the database in a valid or consistent state that satisfies all the constraints
specified on the database schema A single transaction may involve any number of retrieval
operations and any number of update operations. These retrievals and updates will together form an
atomic unit of work against the database.For example, a transaction to apply a bank withdrawal will
typically read the user account record, check if there is a sufficient balance, and then update the

record by the withdrawal amount.
