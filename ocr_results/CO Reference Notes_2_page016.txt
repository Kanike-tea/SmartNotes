ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
* We generally use symbolic-names to write a program.
+ A complete set of symbolic-names and rules for their use constitute an Assembly Language.
* The set of rules for using the mnemonics in the specification of complete instructions and programs is
called the Syntax of the language.
+ Programs written in an assembly language can be automatically translated into a sequence of
machine instructions by a program called an Assembler .
+ The user program in its original alphanumeric text formal is called a Source Program, and the
assembled machine language program is called an Object Program.

For example:
MOVE RO,SUM ;The term MOVE represents OP code for operation performed by instruction.
ADD #5,R3 ;Adds number 5 to contents of register R3 & puts the result back into registerR3.

ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES
+ Directives are the assembler commands to the assembler concerning the program being assembled.
* These commands are not translated into machine opcode in the object-program.
