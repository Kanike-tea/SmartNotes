502 Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

Since DBD is implemented in Prolog, use of uppercase terms is reserved for vari-
ables in the language and therefore lowercase constants are used to code the attri-
butes. For further details on using the DBD system, please refer to the laboratory
manual.

14.37. Using the DBD system, verify your answers to the following exercises:
a. 14.24 (3NF only)
b. 14.25
c. 14.27
d. 14.28

Selected Bibliography

Functional dependencies were originally introduced by Codd (1970). The original
definitions of first, second, and third normal form were also defined in Codd
(1972a), where a discussion on update anomalies can be found. Boyce-Codd nor-
mal form was defined in Codd (1974). The alternative definition of third normal
form is given in Ullman (1988), as is the definition of BCNF that we give here. UIl-
man (1988), Maier (1983), and Atzeni and De Antonellis (1993) contain many of
the theorems and proofs concerning functional dependencies. Date and Fagin
(1992) give some simple and practical results related to higher normal forms.
