2. Three graphs Gj, G2, G3 are shown in Figures 1.78(a), (b), (c) respectively. Are G;
induced subgraphs of G;? Are they spanning subgraphs?

3. Can a finite graph be isomorphic to one of its subgraphs (other than itself)?

Answers

1. (i) No. (ii) Yes. (iii) No.
2, Gy is an induced subgraph of Gy, it is not a spanning subgraph.

G; is not an induced subgraph of Gy, it is spanning subgraph.

3. No.

1.5 Operations on Graphs
Consider two graphs G, = (Vj, E,) and Gy = (V2, Ep).

Then the graph whose vertex set is V1 U V2 and the edge set is E, U Ej is called the i
of G and Go, it is denoted by G; UG». Thus,

Gi UG2 = (Vi U V2, Ey UE).

Similarly, if Vj N V2 ¥ ®, the graph

whose vertex set is Vj A V> and the edge set is Ei?
is called the intersection of G, and Gy; 4

it is denoted by G, NG». Thus,
GiNG2=(ViNVe, EiN ED). if Vin V2 #9.

Next, suppose we consider the graph whose vertex set is V1 UV2 and the edge set is Fi
where E;AE> is the symmetric diffe

vence of E} and E,*. This graph is called the ring
