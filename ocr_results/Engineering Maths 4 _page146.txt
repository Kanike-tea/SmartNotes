. Neighbourhood : A neighbourhood of a point 2q in the complex plane is the set of
all Points z such that | z-Z | < 8 where § is a small positive real number.

Function of a'complex variable

If it is possible to find one or more complex numbers w for every value z inacertain
domain D, we say that w is a function of z defined for the domain D. In
otherwords w = f(z) is called a function of the complex variable z, w is said to be
single valued or many valued function of z according as foragivenvalueof z there
corrresponds one or more than one value of w.
