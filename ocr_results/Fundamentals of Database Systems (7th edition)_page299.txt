8.6 The Tuple Relational Calculus

8.6.1 Tuple Variables and Range Relations

The tuple relational calculus is based on specifying a number of tuple variables.
Each tuple variable usually ranges over a particular database relation, meaning that
the variable may take as its value any individual tuple from that relation. A simple
tuple relational calculus query is of the form:

{t | COND(Z)}

where f is a tuple variable and COND(t) is a conditional (Boolean) expression
involving f that evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE for different assignments of
tuples to the variable t. The result of such a query is the set of all tuples f that evalu-
ate COND(f) to TRUE. These tuples are said to satisfy COND(t). For example, to find
all employees whose salary is above $50,000, we can write the following tuple calcu-
lus expression:

{t | EMPLOYEE(?) AND £.Salary>50000}

The condition EMPLOYEE(‘) specifies that the range relation of tuple variable t is
EMPLOYEE. Each EMPLOYEE tuple ¢ that satisfies the condition f.Salary>50000 will
be retrieved. Notice that f.Salary references attribute Salary of tuple variable ¢; this
notation resembles how attribute names are qualified with relation names or aliases
in SQL, as we saw in Chapter 6. In the notation of Chapter 5, t.Salary is the same as
writing ¢{Salary].

The previous query retrieves all attribute values for each selected EMPLOYEE tuple
t. To retrieve only some of the attributes—say, the first and last names—we write

t.Fname, t.Lname | EMPLOYEE(t) AND f.Salary>50000}

Informally, we need to specify the following information in a tuple relational calcu-
lus expression:

= For each tuple variable f, the range relation R of t. This value is specified by
a condition of the form R(t). If we do not specify a range relation, then the
variable t will range over all possible tuples “in the universe” as it is not
restricted to any one relation.

= A condition to select particular combinations of tuples. As tuple variables
range over their respective range relations, the condition is evaluated for
every possible combination of tuples to identify the selected combinations
for which the condition evaluates to TRUE.

= A set of attributes to be retrieved, the requested attributes. The values of
these attributes are retrieved for each selected combination of tuples.

Before we discuss the formal syntax of tuple relational calculus, consider another query.

Query 0. Retrieve the birth date and address of the employee (or employees)
whose name is John B. Smith.

Q0: {1.Bdate, f.Address | EMPLOYEE(s) AND f.Fname=‘John’ AND f.Minit="B’
AND t.Lname=‘Smith’}
