© The Multiplexing of address bit is usually done by Memory Controller Circuit (Figure 5.11).
© The Controller accepts a complete address & R/W“ signal from theprocessor.
« A Request signal indicates a memory access operation is needed.
¢ Then, the Controller
— forwards the row & column portions of the address to the memory.
— generates RAS’ & CAS" signals &
— sends R/W" & CS" signals to the memory.

RAMBUS MEMORY
© The usage of wide bus is expensive.
¢ Rambus developed the implementation of narrow bus.
¢ Rambus technology is a fast signaling method used to transfer information between chips.
¢ The signals consist of much smaller voltage swings around a reference voltage Vref.
¢ The reference voltage is about 2V.
The two logical values are represented by 0.3V swings above and below Vref.
This type of signaling is generally is known as Differential Signalling.
¢ Rambus provides a complete specification for design of communication called as Rambus Channel.
¢ Rambus memory has a clock frequency of 400 MHz.
¢ The data are transmitted on both the edges of clock so that effective data-transfer rate is SO0OMHZ.
. Circuitry needed to interface to Rambus channel is included on chip. Such chips are called
RDRAM. (RDRAM = Rambus DRAMs).
¢ Rambus channel has:

1) 9 Data-lines (ist-gth line ->Transfer the data, oth line->Parity checking).
2) Control-Line &
3) Power line.
¢ A two channel rambus has 18 data-lines which has no separate Address-Lines.
. Communication between processor and RDRAM modules is carried out by means of
packets transmitted on the data-lines.
¢ There are 3 types of packets:
1) Request
2) Acknowledge &
3) Data.

READ ONLY MEMORY (ROM)

* Both SRAM and DRAM chips are volatile, i.e. They lose the stored information if power is turned off.
«Many application requires non-volatile memory which retains the stored information if power is
turned off.

¢ For ex:

OS software has to be loaded from disk to memory i.e. it requires non-volatile memory.
* Non-volatile memory is used in embedded system.
Since the normal operation involves only reading of stored data, a memory of this type is called ROM.
> At Logic value ‘0’ > Transistor(T) is connected to the ground point(P).
Transistor switch is closed & voltage on bit-line nearly drops to zero (Figure 8.11).
> At Logic value ‘1’ > Transistor switch is
open. The bit-line remains at high
voltage.
