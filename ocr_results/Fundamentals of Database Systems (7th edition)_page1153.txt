30.1 Introduction to Database Security Issues

Database Security: Not an Isolated Concern. When considering the threats
facing databases, it is important to remember that the database management sys-
tem alone cannot be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the data. Rather, the database works as part of a network of services,
including applications, Web servers, firewalls, SSL terminators, and security moni-
toring systems. Because security of an overall system is only as strong as its weakest
link, a database may be compromised even if it would have been perfectly secure on
its own merits.

To protect databases against the threats discussed above, it is common to imple-
ment four kinds of control measures: access control, inference control, flow control,
and encryption. We discuss each of these in this chapter.

In a multiuser database system, the DBMS must provide techniques to enable
certain users or user groups to access selected portions of a database without
gaining access to the rest of the database. This is particularly important when a
large integrated database is to be used by many different users within the same
organization. For example, sensitive information such as employee salaries or
performance reviews should be kept confidential from most of the database sys-
tem’s users. A DBMS typically includes a database security and authorization
subsystem that is responsible for ensuring the security of portions of a database
against unauthorized access. It is now customary to refer to two types of database
security mechanisms:

= Discretionary security mechanisms. These are used to grant privileges to
users, including the capability to access specific data files, records, or fields
in a specified mode (such as read, insert, delete, or update).

= Mandatory security mechanisms. These are used to enforce multilevel
security by classifying the data and users into various security classes (or
levels) and then implementing the appropriate security policy of the organi-
zation. For example, a typical security policy is to permit users at a certain
classification (or clearance) level to see only the data items classified at the
user’s own (or lower) classification level. An extension of this is role-based
security, which enforces policies and privileges based on the concept of orga-
nizational roles. (See Section 30.4.2 for role based access control.)

We discuss discretionary security in Section 30.2 and mandatory and role-based
security in Section 30.3.

30.1.2 Control Measures
Four main control measures are used to provide security of data in databases:

= Access control

= Inference control
= Flow control
