14.5 The Translation Lookaside Buffer 507

A TLB miss may take many extra cycles if the MMU generates an abort exception. The
extra cycles result as the abort handler maps in the requested virtual memory. The ARM720T.
has a single TLB because it has a unified bus architecture. The ARM920T, ARM922T,
ARM926EJ-S, and ARM1026EJ-S have two Translation Lookaside Buffers because they
use a Harvard bus architecture: one TLB for instruction translation and one TLB for data
translation.

14.5.1 SINGLE-STEP PAGE TABLE WALK

If the MMU is searching for a 1 MB section page, then the hardware can find the entry in a

single-step search because 1 MB page table entries are found in the master L1 page table.
Figure 14.9 shows the table walk of an L1 table for a 1 MB section page translation. The

MMU uses the base portion of the virtual address, bits [31:20], to select one of the 4096
