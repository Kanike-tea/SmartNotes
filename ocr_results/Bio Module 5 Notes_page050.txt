commonly found in natural stone. The calcium carbonate acts as a binder and fills in the cracks,
repairing the concrete and restoring its structural integrity. This process is known as
biomineralization.

The Bacillus bacteria used in self-healing bioconcrete are naturally occurring and non-
toxic, so they are considered to be environmentally friendly. They are also able to survive in a
wide range of temperatures and pH levels, making them well-suited for use in concrete.

In addition to repairing cracks, self-healing bioconcrete also has the potential to improve
the overall durability of concrete by reducing the amount of water that is able to penetrate the
surface. This can help to prevent the development of further cracks and increase the longevity of
the concrete.

Technological Importance of Self-Healing Bioconcrete

Self-healing bioconcrete has several important technological advancements that make it a
promising alternative to traditional concrete:

e Increased durability: Self-healing bioconcrete has the ability to repair itself, which can
help to increase its overall durability and reduce the need for maintenance.

e Improved sustainability: By using naturally occurring and non-toxic microorganisms, self-
healing bioconcrete is considered to be a more environmentally friendly alternative to
traditional concrete.

e Reduced maintenance cos

Because self-healing bioconcrete is able to repair itself, it
has the potential to reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs over time.

e Increased longevity: By repairing cracks and reducing the amount of water that is able to
penetrate the surface, self-healing bioconcrete can help to extend the lifespan of concrete
structures.

e New applications: The ability of self-healing bioconcrete to repair itself may open up
new applications for concrete that were not possible with traditional concrete.

e Reduced carbon footprint: The biomineralization process used in self-healing bioconcrete
has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint associated with concrete production, as it
eliminates the need for concrete to be transported and replaced when it becomes
damaged.

Bioremediation and Biomining via Microbial Surface Adsorption (Removal of heavy
metals like Lead, Cadmium, Mercury, Arsenic)

Bioremediation and biomining are two related but distinct processes that utilize living
organisms to clean up contaminated environments or extract valuable minerals, respectively.
