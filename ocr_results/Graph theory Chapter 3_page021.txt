It is to be emphasized that a spanning tree is defined’only“for a connected graph. Ina
disconnected graph of n vertices we cannot find a spanning tree with n vertices. But each
component of a disconnected graph can have a spanning tree. These spanning trees together
form a spanning forest. “Br Rt fo Bl

‘The following two theorems contain some basic results associated with.spanning trees
Theorem 1 .A graph is connected if and only
Proof: Let G bea connected graph. If G has no cycles, then'G is a tree and G itself is a spanniné
tree of G. If G has cycles, delete an edge from each cycle. The resulting graph G’ is cycler
connected and contains all vertices, "This graph, G’, is a sp anning tree of G. Thus, 6 has
