3.5 Program Status Register Instructions 77

CDP —_| coprocessor data processing—perform an operation in a coprocessor

MRC MCR | coprocessor register transfer—move data to/from coprocessor registers

LDC STC | coprocessor memory transfer—load and store blocks of memory to/from a coprocessor

In the syntax of the coprocessor instructions, the cp field represents the coprocessor
number between p0 and p15. The opcode fields describe the operation to take place on
the coprocessor. The Cn, Cm, and Cd fields describe registers within the coprocessor.
The coprocessor operations and registers depend on the specific coprocessor you are
using. Coprocessor 15 (CP15) is reserved for system control purposes, such as memory
management, write buffer control, cache control, and identification registers.

Exampce This example shows a CP15 register being copied into a general-purpose register.
3.27
; transferring the contents of CP15 register cO to register r10
MRC p15, 0, r10, cO, cO, 0

Here CP15 register-0 contains the processor identification number. This register is copied
into the general-purpose register r10.

3.5.2 COPROCESSOR 15 INSTRUCTION SYNTAX

CP15 configures the processor core and hasa set of dedicated registers to store configuration
information, as shown in Example 3.27. A value written into a register sets a configuration
attribute—for example, switching on the cache.

CP15 is called the system control coprocessor. Both MRC and MCR instructions are used to
read and write to CP15, where register Rd is the core destination register, Cn is the primary
register, Cm is the secondary register, and opcode? is a secondary register modifier. You
may occasionally hear secondary registers called “extended registers.”

As an example, here is the instruction to move the contents of CP15 control register cl
into register r] of the processor core:

MRC p15, 0, rl, cl, cO, 0

We use a shorthand notation for CP15 reference that makes referring to configuration
registers easier to follow. The reference notation uses the following format:
