specified using the keyword class in ODL. In the object model, any user-defined
object that is not a collection object is called an atomic object.””

For example, in a UNIVERSITY database application, the user can specify an object
type (class) for STUDENT objects. Most such objects will be structured objects; for
example, a STUDENT object will have a complex structure, with many attributes,
relationships, and operations, but it is still considered atomic because it is not a
collection. Such a user-defined atomic object type is defined as a class by specify-
ing its properties and operations. The properties define the state of the object and
are further distinguished into attributes and relationships. In this subsection, we
elaborate on the three types of components—attributes, relationships, and
operations—that a user-defined object type for atomic (structured) objects can
include. We illustrate our discussion with the two classes EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT
shown in Figure 12.7.

An attribute is a property that describes some aspect of an object. Attributes have
values (which are typically literals having a simple or complex structure) that are
stored within the object. However, attribute values can also be Object_ids of other
objects. Attribute values can even be specified via methods that are used to calculate
the attribute value. In Figure 12.7°* the attributes for EMPLOYEE are Name, Ssn,
Birth_date, Sex, and Age, and those for DEPARTMENT are Dname, Dnumber, Mgr,
Locations, and Projs. The Mgr and Projs attributes of DEPARTMENT have complex
structure and are defined via struct, which corresponds to the tuple constructor of
Section 12.1.3. Hence, the value of Mgr in each DEPARTMENT object will have two
components: Manager, whose value is an Object_id that references the EMPLOYEE
object that manages the DEPARTMENT, and Start_date, whose value is a date. The
locations attribute of DEPARTMENT is defined via the set constructor, since each
DEPARTMENT object can have a set of locations.

A relationship is a property that specifies that two objects in the database are related.
In the object model of ODMG, only binary relationships (see Section 3.4) are
explicitly represented, and each binary relationship is represented by a pair of
inverse references specified via the keyword relationship. In Figure 12.7, one rela-
tionship exists that relates each EMPLOYEE to the DEPARTMENT in which he or she
works—the Works_for relationship of EMPLOYEE. In the inverse direction, each
DEPARTMENT is related to the set of EMPLOYEES that work in the DEPARTMENT—
the Has_emps relationship of DEPARTMENT. The keyword inverse specifies that
these two properties define a single conceptual relationship in inverse directions.””

By specifying inverses, the database system can maintain the referential integrity of
the relationship automatically. That is, if the value of Works_for for a particular

27s mentioned earlier, this definition of atomic object in the ODMG object model is different from the
definition of atom constructor given in Section 12.1.3, which is the definition used in much of the object-
oriented database literature.

?8We are using the Object Definition Language (ODL) notation in Figure 12.7, which will be discussed in
more detail in Section 12.3.6.

?°Section 7.4 discusses how a relationship can be represented by two attributes in inverse directions.
