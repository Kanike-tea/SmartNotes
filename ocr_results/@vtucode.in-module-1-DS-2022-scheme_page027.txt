DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

ANALYSIS

+ Let m and n be the number of non-zero terms in A and B respectively.

+ If m>0 and n>0, the while loop is entered. At each iteration, we increment the value of startA or
startB or both.

+ Since the iteration terminates when either startA or startB exceeds finishA or finishB respectively,
the number of iterations is bounded by m+n-1. This worst case occurs when A(x)=>, x”! and
B(x)=d4+1

+ The asymptotic computing time of this algorithm is O(n+m)
