Since z = re® we get f’(z) = 1-(R/2)

Type-2 : Construction of analytic function f(z) given its real or imaginary part.

Working procedure for problems i :

© Given u or v as functions of x, y we find u,.,: My OF Vy, By and consider
f'(z) = u, + iv, , eee ee “*

© Given u, we use C-R equation v=o orgiven 0 weuse Sy, so that
[‘(z)= uy, - ily or £M= vy + iv,

© We substitute the expression for the partial derivatives in the RHS and then put

x=2, y= 0 toobtain f’(z) asa functionof z.
© Integrating w.r.t.'z we get f(z). d
© — Similarly in the case of polar co-ordinates r, 8 we consider

f'@)= ete (u, + iv,) anduseC-R equation in the RHS, v, = Uy,

1 :
given u or u, =~ given v.
@ Weuse the substitution r = z, 8 = 0 toobtain f'(z) as a function of z.

e Integrating w.r.t z we get f(z). -
This method is known as Milne-Thompson method.

Remark: Substitution ofx = z and y = 0; r = z and 0 = 0 known as Milne - Thompson .

substitution instantly converts the RHS into a function of z. This will be highly helpful when.

the RHS is in a complicated form. However we can plan to convert RHS which is a function ©

ofx and y into a function ofx+iy = z with the result we get f’(z) as a function'of z.", .
Similarly in the case of polar coordinates we can plan to convert the RHS which is a function
ofr and @ into a funciton of r e!° = z with the result we get f’(z) asa function ofz.

f(z) is obtained on integration w.r.t. z in both the cases. °
