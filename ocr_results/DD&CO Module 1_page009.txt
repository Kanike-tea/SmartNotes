Signal Assignment & Logic Polarity

Consider, for example, the electronic gate shown in Fig(b). The truth table for this gate is listed in Fig(a).
It specifies the physical behavior of the gate when H is 3V and L is OV. The truth table of Fig.(c) assumes
a positive logic assignment, with H = | and L = 0. This truth table is the same as the one for the AND

operation. The graphic symbol for a positive logic AND gate is shown in Fig(d).

Now consider the negative logic assignment for the same physical gate with L = 1 and H = 0. The result
is the truth table of Fig(e). This table represents the OR operation, even though the entries are reversed.

The graphic symbol for the negative- logic OR gate is shown in Fig(f).

The Map Method

The complexity of the digital logic gates that implement a Boolean function is directly related to the
complexity of the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented. Although the truth table

representation of a function is unique, when it is expressed algebraically it can appear in many different,
