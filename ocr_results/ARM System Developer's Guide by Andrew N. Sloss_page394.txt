CHAPTER

EMBEDDED
OPERATING
SYSTEMS

This chapter discusses the implementation of embedded operating systems (OS). Because
embedded operating systems are designed for a specific purpose, historically embedded
operating systems were simple, time constrained, and operated in limited memory. This
distinction has changed over time as the sophistication of embedded hardware has increased.
Features, traditionally found on desktop computers, such as virtual memory, have migrated
into the embedded system world.

Since this is a large subject, we have limited our scope to just the fundamental compo-
nents that make up an embedded operating system. We also build on the firmware example
shown in Chapter 10.

This chapter is divided into two sections: The first section takes you through the funda-
mental components that make up an embedded operating system and notes issues specific to
ARM processors. The second section takes you through an example operating system called
the Simple Little Operating System (SLOS). SLOS is designed to show an implementation
of the fundamental components.

11.1 FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS

There is a common set of low-level components, each carrying out a prescribed action, that
form an operating system. It is how these components interact and function that determines
the characteristics of a specific operating system.
