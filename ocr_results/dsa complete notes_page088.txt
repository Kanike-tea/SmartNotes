Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module III

The nodes are numbered in a full binary tree starting with the root on level 1, continuing with the
nodes on level 2, and so on. Nodes on any level are numbered from left to right.

Complete binary tree : A binary tree is complete if the number of nodes in each level i except
possibly the last level is 2! The number of nodes in the last level appears as left as possible.

Example: A complete tree T11 with 11 nodes is shown below. This is not a full binary tree.

Complete Binary Tree

e A binary tree T is said to be a 2-tree or an extended binary tree if each node N has either 0 or
2 children.

e The nodes with 2 children are called internal nodes and the nodes with 0 children are called
external nodes. Sometimes the nodes are distinguished in diagrams by using circles for internal
nodes and squares for external nodes

e The term extended binary tree comes from the operation where tree T is converted into a 2-
tree by replacing each empty subtree by new node and the new tree is a 2-tree . The nodes in
the original tree T are internal nodes in the extended tree and the new nodes are the external
nodes in the extended tree.

Strictly Binary Tree is a tree where every non leaf node in a binary tree has non empty left and
right subtrees.A strictly binary tree with n leaves always contain 2n-1 nodes
