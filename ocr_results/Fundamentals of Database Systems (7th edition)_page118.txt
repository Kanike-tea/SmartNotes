Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

Weak entities can be modeled using the UML construct called qualified association
(or qualified aggregation); this can represent both the identifying relationship
and the partial key, which is placed in a box attached to the owner class. This is
illustrated by the DEPENDENT class and its qualified aggregation to EMPLOYEE in
Figure 3.16. In UML terminology, the partial key attribute Dependent_name is called
the discriminator, because its value distinguishes the objects associated with
(related to) the same EMPLOYEE entity. Qualified associations are not restricted to
modeling weak entities, and they can be used to model other situations in UML.

This section is not meant to be a complete description of UML class diagrams, but
rather to illustrate one popular type of alternative diagrammatic notation that can
be used for representing ER modeling concepts.

3.9 Relationship Types of Degree
Higher than Two

In Section 3.4.2 we defined the degree of a relationship type as the number of par-
ticipating entity types and called a relationship type of degree two binary and a
relationship type of degree three ternary. In this section, we elaborate on the differ-
ences between binary and higher-degree relationships, when to choose higher-
degree versus binary relationships, and how to specify constraints on higher-degree
relationships.

3.9.1 Choosing between Binary and Ternary
(or Higher-Degree) Relationships

The ER diagram notation for a ternary relationship type is shown in Figure 3.17(a),
which displays the schema for the SUPPLY relationship type that was displayed at the
instance level in Figure 3.10. Recall that the relationship set of SUPPLY is a set of rela-
tionship instances (s, j, p), where the meaning is that s is a SUPPLIER who is currently
supplying a PART p to a PROJECT j. In general, a relationship type R of degree n will
have n edges in an ER diagram, one connecting R to each participating entity type.

Figure 3.17(b) shows an ER diagram for three binary relationship types CAN_SUPPLY,
USES, and SUPPLIES. In general, a ternary relationship type represents different
information than do three binary relationship types. Consider the three binary
relationship types CAN_SUPPLY, USES, and SUPPLIES. Suppose that
CAN_SUPPLY, between SUPPLIER and PART, includes an instance (s, p) whenever
supplier s can supply part p (to any project); USES, between PROJECT and PART,
includes an instance (j, p) whenever project j uses part p; and SUPPLIES, between
SUPPLIER and PROJECT, includes an instance (s, j) whenever supplier s supplies
some part to project j. The existence of three relationship instances (s, p),
(j, p), and (s, j) in CAN_SUPPLY, USES, and SUPPLIES, respectively, does not neces-
sarily imply that an instance (s, j, p) exists in the ternary relationship SUPPLY,
because the meaning is different. It is often tricky to decide whether a particular
relationship should be represented as a relationship type of degree n or should be
