Homeomorphic graphs

Two planar graphs G; and G) are said to be homeomorphic if one of these can be obtained
from the other by the process of (i) insertion of new vertices of degree two into its edges, or (ii)
merger of adjacent edges.* err” Ee!

For example, consider the graphs shown in Figures 2.12(a), (b). Observe that the second
graph is obtained from the first graph by inserting the vertex V which is of degree 2 into the
edge AD. Also, the first graph can be obtained from the second graph by merging the edges
AV and VD (to get the single edge ay: Hence, the two graphs are homeomorphic!

[Example 7] Consider the planar graphs Gi, G2 and G3 shown in Figure 2.13. Prove that
(i) G, and G2 are homeomorphic, and (ii) G3 is homeomorphic to both G, and G2
