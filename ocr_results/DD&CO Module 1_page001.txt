Binary logic resembles binary arithmetic, and the operations AND and OR have similarities to
multiplication and addition, respectively. In fact, the symbols used for AND and OR are the same as
those used for multiplication and addition. However, binary logic should not be confused with binary
arithmetic. One should realize that an arithmetic variable designates a number that may consist of many
digits. A logic variable is always either | or 0. For example, in binary arithmetic, we have 1 + 1 = 10
(read “one plus one is equal to 2”), whereas in binary logic, we have 1 + 1 = | (read “one OR one is

equal to one”).
Logic Gates

Logic gates are electronic circuits that operate on one or more input signals to produce an output signal.
Electrical signals such as voltages or currents exist as analog signals having values over a given
continuous range, say, 0 to 3 V, but in a digital system, these voltages are interpreted to be either of two
recognizable values, 0 or 1. Voltage-operated logic circuits respond to two separate voltage levels that
represent a binary variable equal to logic 1 or logic 0. For example, a particular digital system may define
logic 0 as a signal equal to 0 V and logic | as a signal equal to 3 V. In practice, each voltage level has

an acceptable range, as shown in Figure
