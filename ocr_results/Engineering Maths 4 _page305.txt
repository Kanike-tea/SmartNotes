25. Anair line knows that: 5% of the people making reservations on a certain flight will not

turn up. Consequently their policy is to sell 52 tickets for a flight that can only. hold 50
people. What is the probability that there will be a seat for every passenger who turns up ?

>> The probability (p) that a passenger will not turn up is
p=005 + ¢= 095
Let x denote the number of passengers who will not turn up.
P(x) =n p*q"* where n = 52
x

P(x) = 52, (0.05)* (0.95)2-*

A seat is assured for every passenger who turns up if the number of passengers who

fail to turn up is more than or equal to 2.
Hence we have to find P(x > 2)
P(x >2)=1-[P(x<2)]
= 1-[P(x=0)+P(x=1)]
= 1~[ (0.95)? +52 (0.05) (0.95 )4]
. . = 1-0.2595 = 0.7405 :
Probability that a seat is available for every passenger is 0.7405

26. In 800 families with 5 children each how many families would be expected to have
() 3 boys (ii) 5 girls (iii) either 2 or 3 boys (iv) atmost 2 girls by assuming probabilities
for boys and girls to be equal. . i
>> Pp = probability of having a boy = 1/2
4 = probability of having a girl = 1/2
Let x denote the number of boys in the family.
P(x) = od pq'-* where n = 5

1 *c,*s
ie, P(x) = 8, (12) (1/2)°-* = roe
Since we have to find the expected number in respect of 800 families we have
800 P(x) = 800-9 = 25-5, = f(x) (ony)

(i) We have to find f(3)
F(3) = 25-5, = 25 x 10 = 250

Expected number of families with 3 boys is 250,
