For example, an access routine that employs an index to retrieve some rows would be more efficient
that an access routine that performs a full table scan.

The goal of the query optimizer is to find a reasonably efficient strategy for executing the query (not
quite what the name implies) using the access routine:
Optimization typically takes one of two forms: Heuristic Optimization or Cost Based Optimization
In Heuristic Optimization, the query execution is refined based on heuristic rules for reordering the

individual operations.
With Cost Based Optimization, the overall cost of executing the query is systematically reduced by
estimating the costs of executing several different execution plans.

3. Query Code Generator (interpreted or compiled)

Once the query optimizer has determined the execution plan (the specific ordering of access routines),
the code generator writes out the actual access routines to be executed.

With an interactive session, the query code is interpreted and passed directly to the runtime database
processor for execution.

It is also possible to compile the access routines and store them for later execution.

4. Execution in the runtime database processor

At this point, the query has been scanned, parsed, planned and (possibly) compiled.
The runtime database processor then executes the access routines against the database.
The results are returned to the application that made the query in the first place.

Any runtime errors are also returned.
