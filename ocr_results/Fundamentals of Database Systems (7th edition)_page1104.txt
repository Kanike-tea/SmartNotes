association states that if a customer buys X, he or she is also likely to buy Y. In general,
any association rule has the form LHS (left-hand side) => RHS (right-hand side),
where LHS and RHS are sets of items. The set LHS U RHS is called an itemset, the set
of items purchased by customers. For an association rule to be of interest to a data
miner, the rule should satisfy some interest measure. Two common interest measures
are support and confidence.

The support for a rule LHS => RHS is with respect to the itemset; it refers to how
frequently a specific itemset occurs in the database. That is, the support is the per-
centage of transactions that contain all of the items in the itemset LHS U RHS. If
the support is low, it implies that there is no overwhelming evidence that items in
LHS U RHS occur together because the itemset occurs in only a small fraction of
transactions. Another term for support is prevalence of the rule.

The confidence is with regard to the implication shown in the rule. The confidence
of the rule LHS => RHS is computed as the support(LHS U RHS)/support(LHS).
We can think of it as the probability that the items in RHS will be purchased given
that the items in LHS are purchased by a customer. Another term for confidence is
strength of the rule.

Asan example of support and confidence, consider the following two rules: milk =>
juice and bread => juice. Looking at our four sample transactions in Figure 28.1, we
see that the support of {milk, juice} is 50% and the support of {bread, juice} is only
25%. The confidence of milk => juice is 66.7% (meaning that, of three transactions
in which milk occurs, two contain juice) and the confidence of bread => juice is
50% (meaning that one of two transactions containing bread also contains juice).

As we can see, support and confidence do not necessarily go hand in hand. The goal
of mining association rules, then, is to generate all possible rules that exceed some
minimum user-specified support and confidence thresholds. The problem is thus
decomposed into two subproblems:

1. Generate all itemsets that have a support that exceeds the threshold. These
sets of items are called large (or frequent) itemsets. Note that large here
means large support.

2. For each large itemset, all the rules that have a minimum confidence are
generated as follows: For a large itemset X and Y c X, let Z= X — Y; then if
support(X)/support(Z) > minimum confidence, the rule Z => Y (that is,
X—- Y=> Y) isa valid rule.

Generating rules by using all large itemsets and their supports is relatively straight-
forward. However, discovering all large itemsets together with the value for their
