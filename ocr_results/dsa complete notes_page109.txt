Deletion from a binary search tree: Suppose T is a a binary search tree. The function to
delete an item from tree T first search the tree to find the location of the node with the item
and the location of the parent of N and the deletion of the node N depends on three cases:

Case 1: N has no children. Then N is deleted from T by replacing the location of the node N in the
parent(N) by the NULL pointer

Example: Deleting Node 66 with NO children

25 75 25 75
YN / ; a-
15 50 66 Deleting node 15 50

\ 44

Case 2: If N has exactly one child. Then N is deleted from T by replacing the location of N in Parent
(N) by the location of the only child of N.
