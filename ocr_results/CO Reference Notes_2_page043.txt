ASYNCHRONOUS DRAM DESCRIPTION
© The 4 bit cells in each row are divided into 512 groups of 8 (Figure 5.7).
© 21 bit address is needed to access a byte in the memory. 21 bit is divided as follows:
1) 12 address bits are needed to select a row.
i.e. A8-0 — specifies row-address of a byte.
2) 9 bits are needed to specify a group of 8 bits in the selected row.
i.e. A20-9 — specifies column-address of a byte.

© During Read/Write-operation,
— row-address is applied first.
— row-address is loaded into row-latch in response to a signal pulse on RAS? input of chip.
(RAS = Row-address Strobe CAS = Column-address Strobe)
© When a Read-operation is initiated, all cells on the selected row are read and refreshed.
* Shortly after the row-address is loaded, the column-address is
— applied to the address pins &
— loaded into CAS’.
The information in the latch is decoded.
© The appropriate group of 8 Sense/Write circuits is selected.
R/W’=I(read-operation) > Output values of selected circuits are transferred to data-lines DO-D7.
R/W’=0(write-operation) > Information on DO-D7 are transferred to the selected circuits.
RAS" & CAS" are active-low so that they cause latching of address when they change from high
to low.
© To ensure that the contents of DRAMs are maintained, each row of cells is accessed periodically.
© A special memory-circuit provides the necessary control signals RAS" & CAS" that govern the timing.
© The processor must take into account the delay in the response of the memory.

Fast Page Mode
> Transferring the bytes in sequential order is achieved by applying the consecutive sequence of
column-address under the control of successive CAS" signals.
> This scheme allows transferring a block of data at a fasterrate.
> The block of transfer capability is called as fast page mode.
