e Arena Powerskin Carbon Ultra: Another example of a friction-reducing swim suit, the Arena
Powerskin Carbon Ultra is made from a combination of polyurethane and high-tech fabrics
to provide a hydrodynamic and form-fitting design.

e TYR Venzo: The TYR Venzo is a friction-reducing swim suit that incorporates a unique
surface structure inspired by shark skin, as well as other advanced materials to improve
swimmer performance.

4.7 Kingfisher Beak and Bullet Train

The kingfisher beak is an excellent example of nature's design for efficient diving and fishing. Its
unique shape and structure enable the kingfisher to minimize the impact of water resistance and
achieve a successful dive.

The Physics behind the Kingfisher Beak

Streamlining:

The beak of a kingfisher is long, slender, and sharply pointed, which helps reduce drag or air

resistance as the bird dives into the water. The streamlined shape allows the kingfisher to smoothly
cut through the air and minimize the energy required for the dive.

Surface Tension:

When the kingfisher hits the water, it encounters the resistance caused by surface tension. Surface
tension is the cohesive force between water molecules that creates a "skin" on the water's surface.
The sharp beak of the kingfisher helps to pierce through the water's surface, breaking the surface
tension and reducing the force required to enter the water.

Minimizing Splash:

As the kingfisher dives, it needs to enter the water with minimal disturbance to avoid scaring away
the fish it intends to catch. The shape of the beak helps to reduce the splash generated upon
entry. The beak's narrow and pointed design helps create a smooth entry by
