Branch Instructions: Change the flow of execution. These include Branch (B), Branch with Link (BL)
for subroutine calls, Branch Exchange (BX), and Branch Exchange with Link (BLX) for switching
between ARM and Thumb states85 ....

Software Interrupt (SWI) Instruction: Generates a software interrupt exception to call operating
system routines88 .

Program Status Register (PSR) Instructions: Directly control the cpsr and spsr using MRS (move PSR
to register) and MSR (move register to PSR) instructions89 ....

Coprocessor Instructions (CDP, MRC, MCR, LDC, STC): Used to extend the instruction set for cores
with coprocessors, often for tasks like memory management or floating-point operations91 ....

Loading Constants: Pseudo-instructions like LDR Rd, =constant and ADR Rd, label are used to load
32-bit constants and addresses into registers93 ....

Barrel Shifter with Neat Diagram

Figure 1 (not provided, but described) illustrates the barrel shifter as a hardware component that
can preprocess one of the source registers (Rm) before it enters the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)35 .

The barrel shifter allows the 32-bit binary pattern in Rm to be shifted left or right by a specific
number of positions95 . This preprocessing occurs within the cycle time of the instruction,
enhancing the flexibility and power of data processing operations96 .

The barrel shifter supports five different shift operations97 ...:

Logical Shift Left (LSL): Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of places; vacated bits are filled
with zeros. The last bit shifted out goes into the Carry flag (C)97 ....

Logical Shift Right (LSR): Shifts bits to the right by a specified number of places; vacated bits are filled
with zeros. The last bit shifted out goes into the C flag97 .

Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR): Shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign bit (most significant bit) in
the vacated positions. The last bit shifted out goes into the C flag97 .
