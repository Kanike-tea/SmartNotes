regional sales by subregion and also breaking up products by styles. Typically, in
a warehouse, the drill-down capability is limited to the lowest level of aggregated
data stored in the warehouse. For example, compared to the data shown in Fig-
ure 29.6, lower- level data will correspond to something like “the total sales for
style P123 substyle A color Black in zipcode 30022 of sub-region 1.” That level of
aggregation may have been kept in the ODS. Some DBMSs like Oracle offer the
“nested table” concept, which enables access to lower levels of data and thus
makes the drill-down penetrate deeper.

The multidimensional model (also called the dimensional model)-involves two
types of tables: dimension tables and fact tables. A dimension table consists of
tuples of attributes of the dimension. A fact table can be thought of as having
tuples, one per a recorded fact. This fact contains some measured or observed
variable(s) and identifies it (them) with pointers to dimension tables. The fact
table contains the data, and the dimensions identify each tuple in that data.
Another way to look at a fact table is as an agglomerated view of the transaction
data whereas each dimension table represents so-called “master data” that those
transactions belonged to. In multidimensional database systems, the multidimen-
sional model has been implemented as specialized software system known as a
multidimensional database, which we do not discuss. Our treatment of the multi-
dimensional model is based on storing the warehouse as a relational database in
an RDBMS.

Figure 29.7 shows an example of a fact table that can be viewed from the perspective
of multi-dimension tables. Two common multidimensional schemas are the star
schema and the snowflake schema. The star schema consists of a fact table with a
single table for each dimension (Figure 29.7). The snowflake schema is a variation
on the star schema in which the dimensional tables from a star schema are organized
