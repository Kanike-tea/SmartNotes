Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module IV

Example:

Elementary Graph Operations

Given an undirected graph G=(V,E) and a vertex v in V(G) ,there are two ways to find all the
vertices that are reachable from v or are connected to v .

e Depth First Search and
e Breadth First Search

A recursive implementation of depth first search is shown below.

A global array visited is maintained , it is initialized to false, when we visit a vertex i we change the
visited[i] to true.
