3.4 Exhaustive Search 119

similar problems in less than exponential time. Alternatively, we can use one of
many approximation algorithms, such as those described in Section 12.3.

Assignment Problem

In our third example of a problem that can be solved by exhaustive search, there
are n people who need to be assigned to execute n jobs, one person per job. (That
is, each person is assigned to exactly one job and each job is assigned to exactly
one person.) The cost that would accrue if the ith person is assigned to the jth job
is a known quantity C[i, j] for each pair i, j = 1, 2, .. ., 2. The problem is to find
an assignment with the minimum total cost.

A small instance of this problem follows, with the table entries representing
the assignment costs C[i, j]:

Job1 Job2 Job3 Job4

Person 1 9 2 7 8
Person2 6 4 3 7
Person 3 5 8 1 8
Person 4 7 6 9 4

It is easy to see that an instance of the assignment problem is completely
specified by its cost matrix C. In terms of this matrix, the problem is to select one
element in each row of the matrix so that all selected elements are in different
columns and the total sum of the selected elements is the smallest possible. Note
that no obvious strategy for finding a solution works here. For example, we cannot
select the smallest element in each row, because the smallest elements may happen
to be in the same column. In fact, the smallest element in the entire matrix need
not be a component of an optimal solution. Thus, opting for the exhaustive search
may appear as an unavoidable evil.

We can describe feasible solutions to the assignment problem as n-tuples
(it, +++ Jn) in which the ith component, i = 1, ..., n, indicates the column of the
element selected in the ith row (i.e., the job number assigned to the ith person).
For example, for the cost matrix above, (2, 3, 4, 1) indicates the assignment of
Person 1 to Job 2, Person 2 to Job 3, Person 3 to Job 4, and Person 4 to Job 1.
The requirements of the assignment problem imply that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between feasible assignments and permutations of the first n
integers. Therefore, the exhaustive-search approach to the assignment problem
would require generating all the permutations of integers 1, 2,..., n, computing
the total cost of each assignment by summing up the corresponding elements of
the cost matrix, and finally selecting the one with the smallest sum. A few first
iterations of applying this algorithm to the instance given above are shown in
Figure 3.9; you are asked to complete it in the exercises.
