Circular Linked List

A singly linked list in which the last NODE has a null link is called a chain. If the link field of the
last NODE points to the first NODE in the list, then such a linked list is called a circular list.

> > > < last

By keeping a pointer at the last instead of the front we can now insert easily at the front and end of
the list

Function inserts an element to the front of the list

void insertFront(NODE *last, NODE * New)
{/* insert an item at the front of the circular list whose last NODE is last */
