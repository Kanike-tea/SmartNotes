Lab Manual BCS358D-Data Visualization with Python Laboratory

e  plt.title(Linear Plot with Line Formatting'): This line adds a title to the plot. In

this code, the title is set to 'Linear Plot with Line Formatting’.
5. Adding a legend:

e plt.legend(): This line adds a legend to the plot. The legend will display the label
specified in the plot function, which is 'Data Points' in this case. The legend helps
in identifying different data series when multiple lines are present on the plot.

6. Displaying the plot:

e  plt.grid(): This line adds a grid to the plot for better readability.

e  plt.show(): This function is called to display the linear plot on the screen. After
calling this function, the plot will appear in a graphical window with the specified

labels, title, legend, and formatting options.

When you run this program, it will generate a linear plot with the provided data points. The x
and y values are connected by a dashed blue line with circular markers at each data point. The x-
axis and y-axis are labeled as 'X-Axis' and 'Y-Axis,' respectively, and a title 'Linear Plot with
Line Formatting' is displayed at the top of the chart. A legend is also added to the plot to identify
the data series as 'Data Points.’ The grid lines are included for improved readability. This
program demonstrates how to create and customize a linear plot with various formatting options

using Matplotlib in Python.

PROGRAM
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data for the linear plot
x= (1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create a linear plot with line formatting
plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', color='blue', linestyle='--', linewidth=2,
markersize=8, label='Data Points')

# Add labels and a title

plt.xlabel ('X-Axis')

plt.ylabel ('Y-Axis')

plt.title('Linear Plot with Line Formatting')

# Add a legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.grid()
