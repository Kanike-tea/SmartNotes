F = (AB' + A'B)(C + D’) in Fig:3.25

—D

nplementing F = (AB’ + A’B)(C

+ D') with NOR gates

The equivalent AND-OR diagram can be recognized from the NOR diagram by removing
all the bubbles. To compensate for the bubbles in four inputs, it is necessary to
complement the corresponding input literals.

Hardware Description Language

* A hardware description language (HDL) is a computer-based language that
describes the hardware of digital systems in a textual form.

* It resembles an ordinary computer programming language, such as C, but is
specifically oriented to describing hardware structures and the behavior of
logic circuits.

+ It can be used to represent logic diagrams, truth tables, Boolean expressions,
and complex abstractions of the behavior of a digital system.

* One way to view an HDL is to observe that it describes a relationship between
signals that are the inputs to a circuit and the signals that are the outputs of the
circuit.

* For example, an HDL description of an AND gate describes how the logic value of
the gate’s output is determined by the logic values of its inputs.
