We further observe that, in Figure 2,20, the boundary of the region R; is made up of two
edges. Therefore, the degree of Ri is 2; we write this as d(R;) = 2, The boundary of each
of the regions R2 and Rq is made up of 3 edges; therefore, d(R2) = d(R4) = 3. The boundary
of the region R3 consists of 4 edges of which one is a pendant edge. Therefore, d(R3) = 5.
The region Rs is bounded by a single edge (loop); therefore, d(Rs) =A, The boundary of the
exterior region Re consists of six edges; therefore, d(R6) = 6.

We note that

d(R,) + d(R2) + d(R3) + d(R4) + d(Rs) + d(Ro) = 20 -

which is twice the number of edges in the graph. This property is analogous to the handshaking

property and is true for all planar graphs.

It should be pointed out that the regions are determined by a diagram of a planar graph and
not by the graph itself. This means that if we change the diagram of the graph, the regions
determined by the new diagram will be generally different from those determined by the old
one in the sense that a region unbounded in the old diagram need not be unbounded in the new
diagram. However, the interesting fact is that the{total number of regions in the two diagrams
remains the same. The proof of this fact is contained in the following Euler’s fundamental

theorem on planar graphs.
Theorem: A connected planar graph G with n vertices and m edges has
regions in all of its diagrams.

Proof: Let r denote the number of regions in a

exactly m-~m+2

diagram of G. The theorem states that
(yt

r=m-n+2, OF n-m+r=2
XK We give the proof by induction on m. WY ~ ete
