Chapter 1: The Relational Data Model

Introduction

The relational data model was first introduced by Ted Codd of IBM Research in 1970 in a classic
paper (Codd 1970), and it attracted immediate attention due to its simplicity and mathematical
foundation. The model uses the concept of a mathematical relation—which looks somewhat like a
table of values—as its basic building block, and has its theoretical basis in set theory and first-order
predicate logic.

The first commercial implementations of the relational model became available in the early 1980s,
such as the SQL/DS system on the MVS operating system by IBM and the Oracle DBMS. Since
then, the model has been implemented in a large number of commercial, systems. Current popular
relational DBMSs (RDBMSs) include DB2 and Informix Dynamic Server (from IBM), Oracle and
Rdb (from Oracle), Sybase DBMS (from Sybase) and SQLServer,and Access (from Microsoft). In

addition, several open source systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, are available.

1.1 Relational Model Concepts

The relational model represents the database asa collection of relations. Informally, each relation
resembles a table of values or, to some extent, a flat file of records. It is called a flat file because
each record has a simple linear,or flat structure.

When a relation is thought of as a table of values, each row in the table represents a collection of
related data values. A row represents a fact that typically corresponds to a real-world entity or
relationship. The table name and column names are used to help to interpret the meaning of the
values.in each row.

For example, in STUDENT relation because each row represents facts about a particular student
entity. The column names—Name, Student_number, Class, and Major—specify how to interpret the
data values in each row, based on the column each value is in. All values in a column are of the same
data type.

In the formal relational model terminology, a row is called a tuple, a column header is called an
attribute, and the table is called a relation. The data type describing the types of values that can

appear in each column is represented by a domain of possible values.
