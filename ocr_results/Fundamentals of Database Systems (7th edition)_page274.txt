Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus

one has the needed columns (attributes) and contains the result of the operation,
and the other contains the discarded columns. For example, to list each employee’s
first and last name and salary, we can use the PROJECT operation as follows:

Tame, Foam, Salay(EMPLOYEE)

The resulting relation is shown in Figure 8.1(b). The general form of the PROJECT
operation is

Tcattribute list>(R)

where 1 (pi) is the symbol used to represent the PROJECT operation, and <attribute
list> is the desired sublist of attributes from the attributes of relation R. Again,
notice that R is, in general, a relational algebra expression whose result is a relation,
which in the simplest case is just the name of a database relation. The result of the
PROJECT operation has only the attributes specified in <attribute list> in the same
order as they appear in the list. Hence, its degree is equal to the number of attributes
in <attribute list>.

If the attribute list includes only nonkey attributes of R, duplicate tuples are
likely to occur. The PROJECT operation removes any duplicate tuples, so the
result of the PROJECT operation is a set of distinct tuples, and hence a valid
relation. This is known as duplicate elimination. For example, consider the
following PROJECT operation:

T’Sex, Salary(EMPLOYEE)

The result is shown in Figure 8.1(c). Notice that the tuple <‘F’, 25000> appears only
once in Figure 8.1(c), even though this combination of values appears twice in the
EMPLOYEE relation. Duplicate elimination involves sorting or some other technique to
detect duplicates and thus adds more processing. If duplicates are not eliminated, the
result would be a multiset or bag of tuples rather than a set. This was not permitted in
the formal relational model but is allowed in SQL (see Section 6.3).

The number of tuples in a relation resulting from a PROJECT operation is always
less than or equal to the number of tuples in R. If the projection list is a superkey of
R—that is, it includes some key of R—the resulting relation has the same number of
tuples as R. Moreover,

Taiigtt> (Tatist2>(R)) = Teiisti>(R)

as long as <list2> contains the attributes in <list1>; otherwise, the left-hand side is
an incorrect expression. It is also noteworthy that commutativity does not hold
on PROJECT.

In SQL, the PROJECT attribute list is specified in the SELECT clause of a query. For
example, the following operation:

T’Sex, Salary(EMPLOYEE)
would correspond to the following SQL query:

SELECT DISTINCT Sex, Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE
