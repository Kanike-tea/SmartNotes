Stochastic Matrix
A square matrix P is called a stochastic matrix if all the entries of P are non-negative and the sum of all the
entries of any row is 1

(or)
A square matrix P is called a stochastic matrix where each row is in the form of the probability vector.

Regular Stochastic Matrix

A matrix P is said to be a Regular Stochastic Matrix, if all the entries of some power (P”) are positive. The
Regular Stochastic Matrix P has a unique probability vector Q such that QP=Q and all the sum of the probabilities of a
fixed vector matrix should be equal to 1.

Transition Matrix
A transition matrix is also known as a stochastic or probability matrix, is a square matrix (n x n) representing
the transition probabilities of a stochastic system.
