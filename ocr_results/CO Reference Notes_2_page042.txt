Write Operation
The state of the cell is set by
— placing the appropriate value on bit-line b and its complement on b’ and

— then activating the word-line. This forces the cell into the corresponding state.

¢ The required signal on the bit-lines is generated by Sense/Write circuit.

CMOS Cell

Transistor pairs (T3, 75) and (T4, T6) form the inverters in the latch (Figure 8.5).
¢ Instate 1, the voltage at point X is high by having T5,T6 ON and T4,T5 are OFF.
© Thus, T1 and T2 returned ON (Closed), bit-line b and b“ will have high and low signals respectively.

« Advantages:
1) It has low power consumption ,,.“ the current flows in the cell only when the cell is active.

2) Static RAM's can be accessed quickly. It access time is few nanoseconds.
¢ Disadvantage: SRAMs are said to be volatile memories ,,.’ their contents are lost when power is
interrupted.

ASYNCHRONOUS DRAM
« Less expensive RAMs can be implemented if simple cells are used.
© Such cells cannot retain their state indefinitely. Hence they are called Dynamic RAM (DRAM).

© The information stored in a dynamic memory-cell in the form of a charge on a capacitor.
© This charge can be maintained only for tens of milliseconds.

© The contents must be periodically refreshed by restoring this capacitor charge to its full value.

In order to store information in the cell, the transistor T is turned ,,ON" (Figure 8.6).

© The appropriate voltage is applied to the bit-line which charges the capacitor.

After the transistor is turned off, the capacitor begins to discharge.

* Hence, info. stored in cell can be retrieved correctly before threshold value of capacitor drops down.
© During a read-operation,

— transistor is turned ,,ON“
— a sense amplifier detects whether the charge on the capacitor is above the threshold value.

> If (charge on capacitor) > (threshold value) [| Bit-line will have logic value ,,1“.
> If (charge on capacitor) < (threshold value) (1) Bit-line will set to logic value ,,0".
