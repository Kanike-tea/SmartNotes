Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques

Selected Bibliography

The books by Bernstein et al. (1987) and Papadimitriou (1986) are devoted to the
theory and principles of concurrency control and recovery. The book by Gray and
Reuter (1993) is an encyclopedic work on concurrency control, recovery, and other
transaction-processing issues.

Verhofstad (1978) presents a tutorial and survey of recovery techniques in database
systems. Categorizing algorithms based on their UNDO/REDO characteristics is dis-
cussed in Haerder and Reuter (1983) and in Bernstein et al. (1983). Gray (1978)
discusses recovery, along with other system aspects of implementing operating sys-
tems for databases. The shadow paging technique is discussed in Lorie (1977), Ver-
hofstad (1978), and Reuter (1980). Gray et al. (1981) discuss the recovery mechanism
in SYSTEM R. Lockemann and Knutsen (1968), Davies (1973), and Bjork (1973)
are early papers that discuss recovery. Chandy et al. (1975) discuss transaction roll-
back. Lilien and Bhargava (1985) discuss the concept of integrity block and its use
to improve the efficiency of recovery.

Recovery using write-ahead logging is analyzed in Jhingran and Khedkar (1992)
and is used in the ARIES system (Mohan et al., 1992). More recent work on recov-
ery includes compensating transactions (Korth et al., 1990) and main memory
database recovery (Kumar, 1991). The ARIES recovery algorithms (Mohan et al.,
1992) have been successful in practice. Franklin et al. (1992) discusses recovery in
the EXODUS system. Two books by Kumar and Hsu (1998) and Kumar and Song
(1998) discuss recovery in detail and contain descriptions of recovery methods used
ina number of existing relational database products. Examples of page replacement
strategies that are specific for databases are discussed in Chou and DeWitt (1985)
and Pazos et al. (2006).
