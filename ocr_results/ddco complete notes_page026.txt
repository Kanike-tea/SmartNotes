Digital Design and Computer Organization(BCS302)

HDL is used to represent and document digital systems in a form that can be
read by both humans and computers and is suitable as an exchange language
between designers.

Companies that design integrated circuits use proprietary and public HDLs. In
the public domain, there are two standard HDLs that are supported by the IEEE:
VHDL and Verilog.

Verilog is an easier language than VHDL to describe, learn, and use, we have
chosen it for this book.

A Verilog model is composed of text using keywords, of which there are about
100.

Keywords are predefined lowercase identifiers that define the language
constructs. Examples of keywords are module, endmodule, input, output,
wire, and, or, and not.

Any text between two forward slashes ( // ) and the end of the line is interpreted
as a comment and will have no effect on a simulation using the model

Multiline comments begin with / * and terminate with * /.

Verilog is case sensitive, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are
distinguishable (e.g., not is not the same as NOT).

A module is the fundamental descriptive unit in the Verilog language. It is
declared by the keyword module and must always be terminated by the keyword
endmodule.

There 3 types of modelling:

Dataflow modeling describes a system in terms of how data flows through the
system.

Behavioral modeling describes a system’s behavior or function in an algorithmic
fashion.

Structural modeling describes a system in terms of its structure and
interconnections between components.
