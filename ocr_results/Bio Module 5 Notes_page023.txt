printed bone structure can then be implanted into a patient to replace missing or damaged bone
tissue.

There are two main approaches to 3D printing of bones: additive manufacturing and
scaffold-based techniques. Additive manufacturing involves building up the bone structure layer
by layer, whereas scaffold-based techniques involve creating a porous structure that provides a
framework for bone cells to grow and develop.

Additive manufacturing in 3D Printing of Bone

Additive manufacturing involves building up the bone structure layer by layer using
biocompatible materials. The layer-by-layer deposition of material enables the creation of
complex three-dimensional structures that mimic the natural bone tissue. The process of additive
manufacturing in 3D printing of bone involves several key steps.

Steps involved in additive manufacturing of 3D Printed Bone

Patient Imaging:

The process begins with obtaining accurate imaging data of the patient's bone defect or the area
requiring reconstruction. This is typically done using techniques like CT scans or MRI scans.

J
Digital Model Generation:
Using specialized software, the acquired imaging data is processed to create a three-dimensional

digital model of the patient's bone structure. This digital model serves as the basis for designing
the customized bone scaffold.

Scaffold Design:

With the digital model in place, the next step is to design the scaffold or implant. This involves
determining the appropriate shape, size, and internal structure of the scaffold to match the
patient's anatomy and specific requirements. Software tools are used to create the design,
ensuring proper support, porosity, and structural integrity.

J
Material Selection:

Biocompatible materials suitable for bone tissue engineering are chosen for the 3D printing
process. These materials should be capable of supporting cell attachment, growth, and eventual
bone regeneration. Common materials include biocompatible polymers, ceramic composites, or
biodegradable materials.

3D Printing Process:

Once the scaffold design and material selection are finalized, the actual 3D printing process takes
