Even if the queue is empty since the value of rear= size-1 elements cannot be inserted into the queue.
This is the disadvantage of linear queue.

Circular Queue: In a circular queue the queue is arranged in a circular fashion. It is a
moreefficient representation of queue.
Example:
Empty Queue

Fig: Implementation of circular queue for an array of integers

Modification in code to implement circular queue
e Initial value of front and rear=0
e To advance the pointer from size-1 to 0 the code rear++ is modified to rear=(rear +1)%size
and the code front++ is modified to front=(front+1)%size
