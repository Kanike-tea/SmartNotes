into classes (called equivalence classes) such that two elements are in the same
class if and only if they are related. Symmetry ensures that there is no ambiguity
regarding membership in the equivalence class; otherwise, x; may have been

related to x; but not vice versa. Transitivity ensures that in each component every
vertex is joined to every other vertex, because if a is related to b and b is related

so related to c. Transitivity also guarantees that no element can be in
one class. Reflexivity allows an element to be in a class by itself, if it

is not related to any other element in the set.

Relation Matrices: A binary relation R on a set can also be represented by a

matrix, ca

led a relation matrix. It is a (0, 1), n by n matrix, where n is the
elements in the set. The i, j th entry in the matrix is 1 if x;Rx; is true,

and is 0, otherwise. For example, the relation matrix of the relation “is greater
than” on the set of integers (3, 4, 7, 5, 8] is

We shall see in Section 9-8 that this is precisely the adjacency matrix of the
digraph representing the binary relation.
