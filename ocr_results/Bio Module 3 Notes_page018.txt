mucus produced by the respiratory system trap these substances and prevent them from
entering the lungs.

e Moisturization: The air is also humidified as it passes over the moist lining of the respiratory
tract, which helps to keep the airways moist and prevent them from drying out.

e Gas Exchange: Once the air reaches the alveoli, the gas exchange process occurs, where
oxygen diffuses across the thin alveolar and capillary walls into the bloodstream, and carbon
dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction, from the bloodstream into the alveoli to be
exhaled. This process ensures that the bloodstream is supplied with fresh, oxygen-rich air,
while waste carbon dioxide is removed from the body.

Overall, the lung serves as a vital purification system, filtering out harmful substances,
adding oxygen to the bloodstream, and removing waste carbon dioxide. It plays a critical role in
maintaining the body's homeostasis and supporting life.

The architecture of the lung is designed to maximize surface area for efficient gas exchange.
The lung is divided into several parts, including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.

e Trachea: The trachea is the main airway that leads from the larynx (voice box) to the lungs.
It is lined with cilia and mucus-secreting glands that help to filter out harmful substances
and trap them in the mucus.
