49. Obtain the solution of the following equation in terms of Bessel functions.

Le ee

1- =0

ace x dx ae
gee Multiplying the given equationby:* we have,

Py" txy/4(P-W/9)y =0 - . ea(h):
We have Bessel’s equation in the form

Py" txy'+(2-r2)y = 0 -@
The solution is given by y = af, (x)+bU_ (x)
Comparing (1) and (2) we have n? = 1/9 or n =+1/3
Thus the solution of the given equation in terms of Bessel functions is

y= Hatha (x)

. 50... Solve 16x y+ + Lexy’ + (167-1) y = = 0 in terms of Bessel functions.
“>> “The given ‘equation on dividing by 16 becomes,
ey +xy’ $(2-1/16)y #'0 .-- (1)
We have Bessel’s equation in the form,
Py" xy’ +(x -m )y = 0, se Q)

The scat is given by y =a], (2) +H, (x)

Companng, a) and (2) we have; w= = 16 or n= 41/4,
Thus the solution of the given equation i in terms of Bessel functions i is,
