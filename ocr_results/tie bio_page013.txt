An EEG might also be used to confirm brain death in someone in a persistent coma. A
continuous EEG is used to help find the right level of anesthesia for someone in a medically
induced coma. Voltage fluctuations measured by the EEG bioamplifier and electrodes allow
the evaluation of normal brain activity including the posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), first
described by Hans Berger.

EEG can detect abnormal electrical discharges such as sharp waves, spikes or spike-and-
wave complexes that are seen in people with epilepsy, thus it is often used to inform the
medical diagnosis. EEG can detect the onset and spatio-temporal evolution of seizures and
the presence of status epilepticus. It is also used to help diagnose sleep disorders, depth of
anesthesia, coma, encephalopathies, cerebral hypoxia after cardiac arrest, and brain death.
EEG used to be a first- line method of diagnosis for tumors, stroke and other focal brain
disorders, but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging
techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT).
