Divide-and-Conquer

Quicksort

Quicksort is the other important sorting algorithm that is based on the divide-and-
conquer approach. Unlike mergesort, which divides its input elements according
to their position in the array, quicksort divides them according to their value.
We already encountered this idea of an array partition in Section 4.5, where we
discussed the selection problem. A partition is an arrangement of the array’s
elements so that all the elements to the left of some element A[s] are less than
or equal to A[s], and all the elements to the right of A[s] are greater than or equal
to it:

A[O]... A[s—1] Als] A[s +1]... Af» —1]

allare <A[s] allare =A[s]

Obviously, after a partition is achieved, A[s] will be in its final position in the
sorted array, and we can continue sorting the two subarrays to the left and to the
right of A[s] independently (e.g., by the same method). Note the difference with
mergesort: there, the division of the problem into two subproblems is immediate
and the entire work happens in combining their solutions; here, the entire work
happens in the division stage, with no work required to combine the solutions to
the subproblems.
Here is pseudocode of quicksort: call Quicksort(A[0..n — 1]) where

As a partition algorithm, we can certainly use the Lomuto partition discussed
in Section 4.5. Alternatively, we can partition A[0..n — 1] and, more generally, its
subarray A[/..r] (0 </ <r <n — 1) by the more sophisticated method suggested by
C.A.R. Hoare, the prominent British computer scientist who invented quicksort.?
