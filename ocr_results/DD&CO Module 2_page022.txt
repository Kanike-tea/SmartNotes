Three-State Gates

A three-state gate has a control input that can place the gate into a high-impedance state. The high-
impedance state is symbolized by z in Verilog. There are four types of three-state gates, as shown in Fig
below. The bufif] gate behaves like a normal buffer if control = 1. The output goes to a high-impedance
state z when control = 0. The bufif0 gate behaves in a similar fashion, except that the high-impedance
state occurs when control = 1. The two notif gates operate in a similar manner, except that the output is
the complement of the input when the gate is not in a high-impedance state. The gates are instantiated
with the statement

gate name (output, input, control);

in out in [> out

control

control —1
bufifl bufifo

in out in out

control control

notifi notif0
Three-state gates
In simulation, the output can result in 0, 1, x, or z. Two examples of gate instantiation are

bufifl (OUT, A, control);
notif0 (Y, B, enable);
In the first example, input A is transferred to OUT when control = 1. OUT goes to z when control = 0.
In the second example, output Y = z when enable = | and output Y = Bwhen enable = 0.

The outputs of three-state gates can be connected together to form a common output line. To identify
such a connection, Verilog HDL uses the keyword tri (for tristate) to indicate that the output has multiple
drivers. As an example, consider the two-to-one-line multiplexer with three-state gates shown in Fig

below.

The HDL description must use a tri data type for the output:

module mux_tri (m_out, A, B, select);
output m_out;
input A,B, select;
tri m_out;

bufif1 (m_out, A, select);
bufif0 (m_out, B, select);
endmodule
