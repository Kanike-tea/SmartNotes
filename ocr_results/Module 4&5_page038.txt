Microcontrollers - BCS402

The set of cache lines pointed to by the set index are set associative. A data or code block from
main memory can be allocated to any of the four ways in a set without affecting program
behavior; in other words the storing of data in cache lines within a set does not affect program
execution. Two sequential blocks from main memory can be stored as cache lines in the same
way or two different ways. The important thing to note is that the data or code blocks from a
specific location in main memory can be stored in any cache line that is a member of a set. The
placement of values within a set is exclusive to prevent the same code or data block from

simultaneously occupying two cache lines in a set.

The mapping of main memory to a cache changes in a four-way set associative cache. Figure 8
shows the differences. Any single location in main memory now maps to four different locations

in the cache.
