Figure 7.5 Timing of a memory Read operation.

Storing a Word in Memory
¢ Consider the instruction Move R2,(R1). This requires the following sequence:
1) Rlout, MARin ;desired address is loaded into MAR.
2) R2cut,MDRin,Write ;data to be written are loaded into MDR & Write
commandis issued.
3) MDRoute, WMFC ;load data into memory-location pointed by R1 from MDR.

EXECUTION OF A COMPLETE INSTRUCTION
¢Consider the instruction Add (R3),R1 which adds the contents of a
memory-location pointed by R3 to register R1.
«Executing this instruction requires the following actions:

1) Fetch the instruction.

2) Fetch the first operand.

3) Perform the addition

4) Load the result into R1.
Fig:7.6 gives the sequence of control steps required to perform these operations for the
single -bus architecture .
