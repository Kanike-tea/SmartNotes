Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

A typical image database query would be to find images in the database that are
similar to a given image. The given image could be an isolated segment that con-
tains, say, a pattern of interest, and the query is to locate other images that contain
that same pattern. There are two main techniques for this type of search. The first
approach uses a distance function to compare the given image with the stored
images and their segments. If the distance value returned is small, the probability of
a match is high. Indexes can be created to group stored images that are close in the
distance metric so as to limit the search space. The second approach, called the
transformation approach, measures image similarity by having a small number of
transformations that can change one image’s cells to match the other image. Trans-
formations include rotations, translations, and scaling. Although the transforma-
tion approach is more general, it is also more time-consuming and difficult.

A video source is typically represented as a sequence of frames, where each frame is
a still image. However, rather than identifying the objects and activities in every
individual frame, the video is divided into video segments, where each segment
comprises a sequence of contiguous frames that includes the same objects/activi-
ties. Each segment is identified by its starting and ending frames. The objects and
activities identified in each video segment can be used to index the segments. An
indexing technique called frame segment trees has been proposed for video index-
ing. The index includes both objects, such as persons, houses, and cars, as well as
activities, such as a person delivering a speech or two people talking. Videos are also
often compressed using standards such as MPEG.

Audio sources include stored recorded messages, such as speeches, class presenta-
tions, or even surveillance recordings of phone messages or conversations by law
enforcement. Here, discrete transforms can be used to identify the main character-
istics of a certain person’s voice in order to have similarity-based indexing and
retrieval. We will briefly comment on their analysis in Section 26.4.4.

A text/document source is basically the full text of some article, book, or magazine.
These sources are typically indexed by identifying the keywords that appear in the
text and their relative frequencies. However, filler words or common words called
stopwords are eliminated from the process. Because there can be many keywords
when attempting to index a collection of documents, techniques have been devel-
oped to reduce the number of keywords to those that are most relevant to the col-
lection. A dimensionality reduction technique called singular value decomposition
(SVD), which is based on matrix transformations, can be used for this purpose. An
indexing technique called telescoping vector trees (TV-trees) can then be used to
group similar documents. Chapter 27 discusses document processing in detail.

26.4.1 Automatic Analysis of Images

Analysis of multimedia sources is critical to support any type of query or search
interface. We need to represent multimedia source data such as images in terms of
features that would enable us to define similarity. The work done so far in this area
uses low-level visual features such as color, texture, and shape, which are directly
