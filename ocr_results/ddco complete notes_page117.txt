e The external device requests the processor to obtain bus mastership by
enabling start arbitrationsignal.

e In this technique 4 bit code is assigned to each device to request the CPU in
order to obtain busmastership.

e¢ Two or more devices request the bus by placing 4 bit code over the system bus.

e The signals on the bus interpret the 4 bit code and produces winner as a result
from the CPU.

e When the input to the one driver = 1, and input to the another driver = 0, on
the same bus line,this state is called as “Low level voltage state of bus”.

e¢ Consider 2 devices namely A & B trying to access bus mastership at
the same time. Let assigned code for devices A & B are 5 (0101) & 6
(0110) respectively.

e The device A sends the pattern (0101) and device B sends its pattern (0110) to
master. The signals on the system bus interpret the 4 bit code for devices A & B
produces device B as a winner.

e The device B can obtain the bus mastership to initiate direct data transfer
between external devices and main memory.
