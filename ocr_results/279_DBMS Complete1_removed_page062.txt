Additional Operations
Natural Join G2 21)
e Forms Cartesian product of its two arguments, performs selection forcing equality on
those attributes that appear in both relations
e For example consider Borrower and Loan relations, the natural join between them
Borrower Loan will automatically perform the selection on the table returned by
Borrower x Loan which force equality on the attribute that appear in both Borrower
and Loan i.e. Loan-no and also will have only one of the column named Loan-No.

Borrower ™ Loan

e That means = OBorrower.Loan-no = Loan.Loan-no (Borrower x Loan).

e The table returned from this will be as follows:
Eliminate rows that does not satisfy the selection criteria “oporrowerLoan-no = Loan.Loan-no” from Borrower
x Loan =
Borrower.Cust- | Borrower.Loan- | Loan.Loan- | Loan.Amount
name no no
Ram L-13 L-13 1000
Ram EB £30 20000
Ram EB £2 40000
Shyam £30 } 4000
Shyam L-30 L-30 20000
Shyam £30 ER 40000
Suleman £42 } 4000
Suleman £42 £30 20000
Suleman L-42 L-42 40000

And will remove one of the column named Loan-no.

Division Operation:
e denoted by ~ is used for queries that include the phrase “for all”.
e For example “Find customers who has an account in all branches in branch city

Agra”. This query can be solved by following statement.

Depositor Account
T castomer-name. branch-name (= ) + TToranch-name (OBranch-city="Agra’(Branch)

e The division operations can be specified by using only basic operations as follows:
Let r(R) and s(S) be given relations for schema R and § with °=R
r+s=TIrs(r) - Urs (Irs (r) x s) - Tks s(r))
