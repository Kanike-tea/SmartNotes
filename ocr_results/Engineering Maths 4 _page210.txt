But Cauchy's theorem imposes the condition on f (2) to be analytic.

-Hete f(z)= Iz I? or urine dai

u=x+¥ and v=0 ;
Alsou, = 2 uy = Py», = 0, vy =0

Canchy‘Riemann equations Wy = Wy and v, =u, arenot satisfied.

_ Hence, f(z) = Iz 1? is not analytic.

Thisis the reason for Cauchy's theorem not being satisfied.
