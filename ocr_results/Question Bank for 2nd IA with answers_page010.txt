Single-chamber pacemaker: A single-chamber pacemaker delivers electrical impulses to either the right
atrium or the right ventricle of the heart to regulate its rhythm.

Dual-chamber pacemaker: A dual-chamber pacemaker delivers electrical impulses to both the right
atrium and the right ventricle of the heart to regulate its rhythm.

Biventricular pacemaker: A biventricular pacemaker delivers electrical impulses to both ventricles of the

heart to coordinate their contractions and improve heart function in people with heart failure.

What is spirometry? Discuss the types and functioning of the spirometry.

Ans. Spirometry is a pulmonary function test that measures lung capacity and airflow by assessing the
volume of air inhaled and exhaled, as well as the speed at which it's expelled. It helps diagnose and monitor
various lung conditions like asthma, COPD, and other respiratory issues. Spirometry can be performed
using different devices, including basic incentive spirometers, professional-grade spirometers, and digital
peak flow meters.

Types of Spirometers:

Basic Incentive Spirometer: These are handheld devices used to encourage deep breathing and lung
expansion after surgery or illness, according to CMI Health.

Professional Spirometer: These are more sophisticated devices, often used in clinical settings, and
typically measure more parameters than basic incentive spirometers.

Digital Peak Flow Meter: These devices measure the peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), which is the
maximum speed at which air can be exhaled.

Digital Smart Spirometers: Some digital spirometers, like SpiroLink, are designed for home use and can

measure PEF, FEV 1, and other lung function parameters.

Functioning of Spirometry:

1. Preparation: The patient sits upright and is instructed on how to perform the test, which involves a full
inhalation and a forceful, rapid exhalation.

2. Forced Exhalation: The patient breathes in deeply, then exhales as forcefully and as quickly as possible
into the spirometer.

3. Measurement: The spirometer measures the volume of air exhaled at different time points and graphs
the results.

4. Analysis: Key parameters, such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEV 1), and the FEV1/FVC ratio, are calculated from the graph.

5. Interpretation: The results are compared to normal values for the patient's age, gender, and height to
determine if there are any abnormalities in lung function.

Spirometry is a crucial tool for diagnosing and monitoring respiratory conditions, helping healthcare

professionals understand the extent of airflow limitations and track the effectiveness of treatments.
