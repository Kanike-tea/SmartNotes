26.2 Temporal Database Concepts

case, the specified time period is compared with the valid time period of each tuple
version [T.Vst, T.Vet], and only those tuples that satisfy the condition are selected.
In these operations, a period is considered to be equivalent to the set of time points
from T\ to T> inclusive, so the standard set comparison operations can be used.
Additional operations, such as whether one time period ends before another starts,
are also needed.”!

Some of the more common operations used in queries are as follows:

[T-Vst, T.Vet] INCLUDES [T), T>] Equivalent to T, > T.Vst AND T> < T.Vet
[T.Vst, T.Vet] INCLUDED_IN [T}, T>] Equivalent to T, < T:Vst AND T> > T.Vet
[T.Vst, T.Vet] OVERLAPS [7}, T>] Equivalent to (T; < T.Vet AND T; > T.Vst)”?
[TVst, T:Vet] BEFORE [T}, T2] Equivalent to T, = T.Vet

[T.Vst, T.Vet] AFTER [T}, T>] Equivalent to T> < T:Vst

[T.Vst, T.Vet] MEETS_BEFORE [T), T] Equivalent to T, = T.Vet + 1°
[T.Vst, T.Vet] MEETS AFTER [T}, T,] _ Equivalent to T, + 1 = T-Vst

Additionally, operations are needed to manipulate time periods, such as computing
the union or intersection of two time periods. The results of these operations may
not themselves be periods, but rather temporal elements—a collection of one or
more disjoint time periods such that no two time periods in a temporal element are
directly adjacent. That is, for any two time periods [T), T,] and [T3, Ts] in a tempo-
ral element, the following three conditions must hold:

= [T\, T,] intersection [T3, T4] is empty.

= T; is not the time point following T; in the given granularity.

= T, is not the time point following T, in the given granularity.
The latter conditions are necessary to ensure unique representations of temporal
elements. If two time periods [T), T2] and [T;, T,] are adjacent, they are combined

into a single time period [T), T,]. This is called coalescing of time periods. Coalesc-
ing also combines intersecting time periods.

To illustrate how pure time conditions can be used, suppose a user wants to select
all employee versions that were valid at any point during 2002. The appropriate
selection condition applied to the relation in Figure 26.8 would be

[T-Vst, T.Vet] OVERLAPS [2002-01-01, 2002-12-31]

Typically, most temporal selections are applied to the valid time dimension. For a
bitemporal database, one usually applies the conditions to the currently correct

°1,A complete set of operations, known as Allen’s algebra (Allen, 1983), has been defined for comparing
time periods.

22This operation returns true if the intersection of the two periods is not empty; it has also been called
INTERSECTS_WITH.

?8Here, 1 refers to one time point in the specified granularity. The MEETS operations basically specify if
one period starts immediately after another period ends
