PROJ_DEPT — PROJECT * DEPT
The attribute Dnum is called the join attribute for the NATURAL JOIN operation, because it is the

only attribute with the same name in both relations.

If the attributes on which the natural join is specified already have the same names in both relations,
renaming is unnecessary. For example, to apply a natural join on the Dnumber attributes of
DEPARTMENT and DEPT_LOCATIONS, it is sufficient to write

DEPT_LOCS <— DEPARTMENT * DEPT LOCATIONS

DEPT_LOCS
Dname Dnumber Mgr_ssn. Mgr_start_date Location

In general, the join condition for NATURAL JOIN is constructed by equating each pair of join
attributes that have the same name in the two relations and combining these conditions with AND.

Tf no combination of tuples satisfies the join condition, the result of a JOIN is an empty relation with

zero tuples.
A more general, but nonstandard definition for NATURAL JOIN is
QeR * (<tist>),( <list2: 5
where,

<list1>: list of i attributes from R,
<list2> : list of 7 attributes from S

The lists are used to form equality comparison conditions between pairs of corresponding attributes
and then the conditions are then ANDed together. Only the list corresponding to attributes of the first
relation R—<list!1>— is kept in the result Q.
