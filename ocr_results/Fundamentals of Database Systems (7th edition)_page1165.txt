30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security

1. A subject S is not allowed read access to an object O unless class(S) =
class(O). This is known as the simple security property.

2. A subject S is not allowed to write an object O unless class(S) < class(O).
This is known as the star property (or *-property).

The first restriction is intuitive and enforces the obvious rule that no subject can read
an object whose security classification is higher than the subject’s security clearance.
The second restriction is less intuitive. It prohibits a subject from writing an object at
a lower security classification than the subject’s security clearance. Violation of this
rule would allow information to flow from higher to lower classifications, which vio-
lates a basic tenet of multilevel security. For example, a user (subject) with TS clear-
ance may make a copy of an object with classification TS and then write it back as a
new object with classification U, thus making it visible throughout the system.

To incorporate multilevel security notions into the relational database model, it is
common to consider attribute values and tuples as data objects. Hence, each attri-
bute A is associated with a classification attribute C in the schema, and each attribute
value in a tuple is associated with a corresponding security classification. In addition,
in some models, a tuple classification attribute TC is added to the relation attributes
to provide a classification for each tuple as a whole. The model we describe here is
known as the multilevel model, because it allows classifications at multiple security
levels. A multilevel relation schema R with n attributes would be represented as:

R(Aj, Cy, Ap, Cy «-- Ap Cy TC)
where each C; represents the classification attribute associated with attribute Aj.

The value of the tuple classification attribute TC in each tuple t—which is the high-
est of all attribute classification values within t—provides a general classification for
the tuple itself. Each attribute classification C; provides a finer security classification
for each attribute value within the tuple. The value of TC in each tuple t is the high-
est of all attribute classification values C; within t.

The apparent key of a multilevel relation is the set of attributes that would have
formed the primary key in a regular (single-level) relation. A multilevel relation will
appear to contain different data to subjects (users) with different clearance levels. In
some cases, it is possible to store a single tuple in the relation at a higher classifica-
tion level and produce the corresponding tuples at a lower-level classification
through a process known as filtering. In other cases, it is necessary to store two or
more tuples at different classification levels with the same value for the apparent
key. This leads to the concept of polyinstantiation,° where several tuples can have
the same apparent key value but have different attribute values for users at different
clearance levels.

We illustrate these concepts with the simple example of a multilevel relation shown.
in Figure 30.2(a), where we display the classification attribute values next to each

This is similar to the notion of having multiple versions in the database that represent the same
real-world object.
