Discuss the different types of transaction failures. What is meant by cata-
strophic failure?

Discuss the actions taken by the read_item and write_item operations on a
database.

What is the system log used for? What are the typical kinds of entries in a
system log? What are checkpoints, and why are they important? What are
transaction commit points, and why are they important?

How are buffering and caching techniques used by the recovery subsystem?

What are the before image (BFIM) and after image (AFIM) of a data item?
What is the difference between in-place updating and shadowing, with
respect to their handling of BFIM and AFIM?

What are UNDO-type and REDO-type log entries?
Describe the write-ahead logging protocol.

Identify three typical lists of transactions that are maintained by the recov-
ery subsystem.

- What is meant by transaction rollback? What is meant by cascading rollback?

Why do practical recovery methods use protocols that do not permit cascad-
ing rollback? Which recovery techniques do not require any rollback?

. Discuss the UNDO and REDO operations and the recovery techniques that

use each.

Discuss the deferred update technique of recovery. What are the advantages and
disadvantages of this technique? Why is it called the NO-UNDO/REDO method?

How can recovery handle transaction operations that do not affect the data-
base, such as the printing of reports by a transaction?

Discuss the immediate update recovery technique in both single-user and
multiuser environments. What are the advantages and disadvantages of
immediate update?

What is the difference between the UNDO/REDO and the UNDO/NO-REDO
algorithms for recovery with immediate update? Develop the outline for an
UNDO/NO-REDO algorithm.

Describe the shadow paging recovery technique. Under what circumstances
does it not require a log?

Describe the three phases of the ARIES recovery method.

What are log sequence numbers (LSNs) in ARIES? How are they used? What
information do the Dirty Page Table and Transaction Table contain?
Describe how fuzzy checkpointing is used in ARIES.
