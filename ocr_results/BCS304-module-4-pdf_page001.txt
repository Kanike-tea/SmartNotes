We can easily replace the recursive search function with a comparable iterative one. The

function searches! accomplishes this by replacing the recursion with a while loop.

tree.pointer search2itree-pointer tree, int key)
{
/* return a pointer to the node that contains key. If
there is no such node, return NULL. °/
while itree) {
if (key == tree->data) return tree;
if (key < tree->data)
tree + tree->left—child:
elee
tree + tree->right—child;
)
return NULL;

Iterative search of a binary search tree
4.1.2 Inserting into A Binary Search Tree:

To insert a new element, key, we must first verify that the key is different from those of existing
elements. To do this we search the tree. If the search is unsuccessful, then we insert the element
at the point the search terminated. For instance, to insert an element with key 80 into the tree,
we first search the tree for 80. This search terminates unsuccessfully, and the last node
examined has value 40. We insert the new element as the right child of this node. The resulting
search tree is shown in Figure 5.31(a). Figure 5.31(b) shows the result of inserting the key 35
into the search tree of Figure 5.31(a). This strategy is implemented by insert-node (Program
5.17). This uses the function modified -search which is a slightly modified version of function
search 2 (Program 5.16). This function searches the binary search tree *node for the key num.
If the tree is empty or if num is present, it returns NULL. Otherwise, it returns a pointer to the
last node of the tree that was encountered during the search. The new element is to be inserted
as a child of this node.

(a) Insert 80 (b) Insert 35
