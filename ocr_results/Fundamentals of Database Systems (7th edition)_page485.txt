13.8 Summary

document with the root tag “dept4emps”. Then we can write the SQL/XML
query X3:

X3: SELECT XMLROOT (
XMLELEMENT (NAME “dept4emps”,

XMLAGG (
XMLELEMENT (NAME “emp”
XMLFOREST (Lname, Fname, Salary)
ORDER BY Lname ) ) )

FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE = Dno=4;;

The XMLROOT function creates a single root element, so the XML data would be a
well-formed document (a tree with a single root). The result of X3 on the data
shown in Figure 5.6 would be:

<dept4emps>

<emp><Lname>Jabbar</Lname><Fname>Ahmad</Fname><Salary>25000
</Salary></emp>

<emp><Lname>Wallace</Lname><Fname>Jennifer
</Fname><Salary>43000</Salary></emp>

<emp><Lname>Zelaya</Lname><Fname>Alicia</Fname><Salary>25000
</Salary></emp>

</dept4emps>

These examples give a flavor of how the SQL standard has been extended to allow
users to format query results as XML data.

13.8 Summary

This chapter provided an overview of the XML standard for representing and
exchanging data over the Internet. First we discussed some of the differences between
various types of data, classifying three main types: structured, semistructured, and
unstructured. Structured data is stored in traditional databases. Semistructured data
mixes data types names and data values, but the data does not all have to follow a
fixed predefined structure. Unstructured data refers to information displayed on the
Web, specified via HTML, where information on the types of data items is missing.
We described the XML standard and its tree-structured (hierarchical) data model,
and we discussed XML documents and the languages for specifying the structure of
these documents, namely, XML DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML
schema. We gave an overview of the various approaches for storing XML docu-
ments, whether in their native (text) format, in a compressed form, or in relational
and other types of databases. We gave an overview of the XPath and XQuery lan-
guages proposed for querying XML data, and we discussed the mapping issues that
arise when it is necessary to convert data stored in traditional relational databases
into XML documents. Finally, we discussed SQL/XML, which provides SQL with
additional functionality to format SQL query results as XML data.
