to the first vertex on v's adjacency list. To implement this scheme, as we visit each vertex, we
place the vertex in a queue. When we have exhausted an adjacency list, we remove a vertex
from the queue and proceed by examining each of the vertices on its adjacency list. Unvisited
vertices are visited and then placed on the queue; visited vertices are ignored. We have finished

the search when the queue is empty.

The queue definition and the function prototypes used by BFS are:

typedef struct queue *queue_pointer;
typedef struct queue {
int vertex;

queue_pointer link;

}3
void addq(queue_pointer *, queue_pointer *, int);
int deleteq(queue_pointer *);

void bfs(int v)
{
/* breadth first traversal)of a graph, starting with node v
the global array visited: is initialized to 0, the queue
operations are similar t6é those Geseribed in
Chapter 4. */
node_pointer w;
queve_pointer<€ront, rear;
front s\ reat = NULL; /* bnitialize queue */
princ£(**Sa~, v);
visited{v] = TRUE;
addy (&front, &rear, v);
while (front) {
Vv = deleteg(&front);
for, (w = graphiv]; w: w = w->link)
if (!visited(w->vertex]) (
printf£(*t5d", w->vertex);
addg (&front, &rear,w->vertex);
visited[w->vertex] = TRUE;
