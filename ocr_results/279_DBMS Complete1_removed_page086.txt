After removing the portion into another relation we store lesser amount of data in two relations
without any loss information. There is also a significant reduction in redundancy.

Third Normal Form (3NF)

A relation is said to be in 3NF, if it is already in 2NF and there exists no transitive dependency in
that relation. Speaking inversely, if a table contains transitive dependency, then it is not in 3NF, and
the table must be split to bring it into 3NF.

What is a transitive dependency? Within a relation if we see
A— B[B depends on A]

An
B-— C[C depends on B]
Then we may derive
A— C[C depends on A]

Such derived dependencies hold well in most of the situations. For example if we have
Roll > Marks

An
Marks — Grade

Then we may safely derive
Roll — Grade.

This third dependency was not originally specified but we have derived it.

The derived dependency is called a transitive dependency when such dependency becomes
improbable. For example we have been given

Roll > City

And

City > STDCode

If we try to derive Roll -- STDCode it becomes a transitive dependency, because obviously the
STDCode of a city cannot depend on the roll number issued by a school or college. In such a case
the relation should be broken into two, each containing one of these two dependencies:

Roll > City

And

City — STD code
