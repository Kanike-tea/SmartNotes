INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING

Theory:- Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level
programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl,
Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial

gives enough understanding of Python programming language.
Prerequisites

We should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic

understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus.

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is
designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages

use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

e Python is Interpreted — Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not
need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

e Python is Interactive — You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
interpreter directly to write your programs.

e Python is Object-Oriented — Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of
programming that encapsulates code within objects.

e Python is a Beginner's Language — Python is a great language for the beginner-level
programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple

text processing to WWW browsers to games.

Why the name python?

a Nace Guido van Rossum was interested on watching a comedy show, which
is telecasting on the BBC channel from 1969 to 1974. The complete
Monty Python's Flying Circus.

“3 Guido Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique,

and slightly mysterious for his programming language, so he decided

to call the language Python.
