ooted Trees

A complete m-ary tree for which m = 2 is called a complete binary tree

In other oR a rooted tree T is called a complete binary tree if every internal vertex of T
is of out-degree 2; that is if every internal vertex has exactly two children,

The rooted nen shown in Figure 3.7 is a binary tree; it is not a complete binary tree. The
rooted tree shown in Figure 3.8 is a complete binary tree,

Figure 3.8
Balanced Tree —
If T is a rooted tree and A is the lar, est level num level number achieved chieved by a leaf of T, then T is said

to i E . h. A rooted tree of height A is iis said to to be ) be balanced alanced if nigel every
(fée shown in Figure 3.7 is of height 4 and is balanced too. The tree shown in Figure 3.8
is of height 4 but is not balanced.

Full binary Tree
Lat T be a complete binary tree of height h. Then T is called a ‘full binary tree if all the

leaves in T are at level h.
The complete binary tree shown in Figure 3.8 is not a full binary tree. The tree shown in

Figure 3.9 is a full binary tree.
