DATAIN register: is a part of input device. It is used to store the ASCII characters read from
keyboard.

DATAOUT register: is a part of output device. It is used to store the ASCII
characters to bedisplayed on the output device.

STATUS register stores the status of working of I/O devices —

e SIN flag - This flag is set to 1, when DATAIN buffer contains the data
from keyboard. The flag is set to O, after the data is passed from DATAIN
buffer to the processor.

¢ SOUT flag - This flag is set to 1, when DATAOUT buffer is empty and
the data can be added to it by processor. The flag is set to 0, when
DATAOUT buffer has the data to be displayed.

¢ KIRQ (Keyboard Interrupt Request) -— By setting this flag to 1, keyboard
requests the processor to obtain its service and an interrupt is sent to the
processor. It is used along with the SIN flag.
