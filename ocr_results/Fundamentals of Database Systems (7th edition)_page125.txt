3.11 Summary

examples that is used throughout this text. We defined the basic ER model concepts
of entities and their attributes. Then we discussed NULL values and presented the
various types of attributes, which can be nested arbitrarily to produce complex
attributes:

= Simple or atomic

= Composite

= Multivalued
We also briefly discussed stored versus derived attributes. Then we discussed the
ER model concepts at the schema or “intension” level:
Entity types and their corresponding entity sets
Key attributes of entity types
Value sets (domains) of attributes
Relationship types and their corresponding relationship sets

Participation roles of entity types in relationship types

We presented two methods for specifying the structural constraints on relationship
types. The first method distinguished two types of structural constraints:

= Cardinality ratios (1:1, 1:N, M:N for binary relationships)
= Participation constraints (total, partial)

We noted that, alternatively, another method of specifying structural constraints is
to specify minimum and maximum numbers (min, max) on the participation of
each entity type in a relationship type. We discussed weak entity types and the
related concepts of owner entity types, identifying relationship types and partial key
attributes.

Entity-relationship schemas can be represented diagrammatically as ER diagrams.
We showed how to design an ER schema for the COMPANY database by first defin-
ing the entity types and their attributes and then refining the design to include rela-
tionship types. We displayed the ER diagram for the COMPANY database schema.
We discussed some of the basic concepts of UML class diagrams and how they
relate to ER modeling concepts. We also described ternary and higher-degree
relationship types in more detail, and we discussed the circumstances under which
they are distinguished from binary relationships. Finally, we presented require-
ments for a UNIVERSITY database schema as another example, and we showed the
ER schema design.

The ER modeling concepts we have presented thus far—entity types, relationship
types, attributes, keys, and structural constraints—can model many database appli-
cations. However, more complex applications—such as engineering design, medi-
cal information systems, and telecommunications—require additional concepts if
we want to model them with greater accuracy. We discuss some advanced model-
ing concepts in Chapter 8 and revisit further advanced data modeling techniques in
Chapter 26.
