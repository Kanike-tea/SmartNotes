2.1. Basic Architecture of a Cache Memory
A simple cache memory is shown on the right side of Figure 4. It has three main parts:

e A directory store
eA data section

Status information.

All three parts of the cache memory are present for each cache line. The cache must know where
the information stored in a cache line originates from in main memory. It uses a directory store to
hold the address identifying where the cache line was copied from main memory. The directory

entry is known as a cache-tag.

A cache memory must also store the data read from main memory. This information is held in

the data section.

The size of a cache is defined as the actual code or data the cache can store from main memory.

Not included in the cache size is the cache memory required to support cache-tags or status bit

There are als

status bits in cache memory to maintain state information. Two common status
bits are the valid bit and dirty bit. A valid bit marks a cache line as active, meaning it contains
live data originally taken from main memory and is currently available to the processor core on
demand. A dirty bit defines whether or not a cache line contains data that is different from the

value it represents in main memory.
