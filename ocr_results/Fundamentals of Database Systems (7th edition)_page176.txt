Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

ERwin or Rational Rose in Lab Exercise 3.31. Modify this diagram by clas-
sifying COURSES as either UNDERGRAD_COURSES or GRAD_COURSES
and INSTRUCTORS as either JUNIOR_PROFESSORS or SENIOR_PROFESSORS.
Include appropriate attributes for these new entity types. Then establish
relationships indicating that junior instructors teach undergraduate courses
whereas senior instructors teach graduate courses.

Selected Bibliography

Many papers have proposed conceptual or semantic data models. We give a repre-
sentative list here. One group of papers, including Abrial (1974), Senko’s DIAM
model (1975), the NIAM method (Verheijen and VanBekkum 1982), and Bracchi
et al. (1976), presents semantic models that are based on the concept of binary rela-
tionships. Another group of early papers discusses methods for extending the rela-
tional model to enhance its modeling capabilities. This includes the papers by
Schmid and Swenson (1975), Navathe and Schkolnick (1978), Codd’s RM/T model
(1979), Furtado (1978), and the structural model of Wiederhold and Elmasri (1979).

The ER model was proposed originally by Chen (1976) and is formalized in Ng
(1981). Since then, numerous extensions of its modeling capabilities have been pro-
posed, as in Scheuermann et al. (1979), Dos Santos et al. (1979), Teorey et al. (1986),
Gogolla and Hohenstein (1991), and the entity-category-relationship (ECR) model
of Elmasri et al. (1985). Smith and Smith (1977) present the concepts of generaliza-
tion and aggregation. The semantic data model of Hammer and McLeod (1981)
introduces the concepts of class/subclass lattices, as well as other advanced model-
ing concepts.

A survey of semantic data modeling appears in Hull and King (1987). Eick (1991)
discusses design and transformations of conceptual schemas. Analysis of con-
straints for n-ary relationships is given in Soutou (1998). UML is described in detail
in Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson (1999). Fowler and Scott (2000) and Stevens
and Pooley (2000) give concise introductions to UML concepts.

Fensel (2000, 2003) discusses the Semantic Web and application of ontologies.
Uschold and Gruninger (1996) and Gruber (1995) discuss ontologies. The June
2002 issue of Communications of the ACM is devoted to ontology concepts and
applications. Fensel (2003) discusses ontologies and e-commerce.
