14.5 Boyce-Codd Normal Form

If we apply the above 3NF definition to LOTS with the dependencies FD1 through
FD4, we find that both FD3 and FD4 violate 3NF by the general definition above
because the LHS County_name in FD3 is not a superkey. Therefore, we could
decompose LOTS into LOTS1A, LOTS1B, and LOTS2 directly. Hence, the transitive
and partial dependencies that violate 3NF can be removed in any order.

14.4.3 Interpreting the General Definition of Third Normal Form

A relation schema R violates the general definition of 3NF if a functional depen-
dency X — A holds in R that meets either of the two conditions, namely (a) and (b).
The first condition “catches” two types of problematic dependencies:

= Anonprime attribute determines another nonprime attribute. Here we typi-
cally have a transitive dependency that violates 3NF.

= A proper subset of a key of R functionally determines a nonprime attribute.
Here we have a partial dependency that violates 2NF.

Thus, condition (a) alone addresses the problematic dependencies that were causes
for second and third normalization as we discussed.

Therefore, we can state a general alternative definition of 3NF as follows:

Alternative Definition. A relation schema R is in 3NF if every nonprime attribute
of R meets both of the following conditions:

= Itis fully functionally dependent on every key of R.
= It is nontransitively dependent on every key of R.

However, note the clause (b) in the general definition of 3NF. It allows certain func-
tional dependencies to slip through or escape in that they are OK with the 3NF
definition and hence are not “caught” by the 3NF definition even though they may
be potentially problematic. The Boyce-Codd normal form “catches” these depen-
dencies in that it does not allow them. We discuss that normal form next.

14.5 Boyce-Codd Normal Form

Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNEF) was proposed as a simpler form of 3NF, but it
was found to be stricter than 3NF. That is, every relation in BCNF is also in 3NF;
however, a relation in 3NF is not necessarily in BCNF. We pointed out in the last
subsection that although 3NF allows functional dependencies that conform to the
clause (b) in the 3NF definition, BCNF disallows them and hence is a stricter defini-
tion of a normal form.

Intuitively, we can see the need for a stronger normal form than 3NF by going back to
the LOTS relation schema in Figure 14.12(a) with its four functional dependencies FD1
through FD4. Suppose that we have thousands of lots in the relation but the lots are
from only two counties: DeKalb and Fulton. Suppose also that lot sizes in DeKalb
County are only 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 acres, whereas lot sizes in Fulton County
