43.1 Max-flow and Min-cut Theorem

The following theorem, known as the Max-flow and Min-cut theorem, contains an im
result in the theory of transport networks.

Theorem : The maximum possible flow between two vertices A and Bina transport neh
is equal joe minimaom of the capacities of all cut-sels with Tespect to A and B*, ———
Proof : Consider any cut-set S with respect to the vertices A and B in a graph Gr ing
a transport network. Then, in the subgraph G — S there occurs no path between es

Therefore, every path in G between A and B

every flow between A and B must pass through at least one edge that belongs to S. Hence the

total flow-rate between A and B cannot exceed the capacity of §. Since S is an arbitrary cutsy

with respect to A and B, this result holds for all such cut-sets and therefore for the cut-set with
