DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

Unions
> This is similar to a structure, but the fields of a union must share their memory space.

This means that only one field of the union is "active" at any given time.

typedef struct sex—type {
enum tag-field {female, male
} sex;

union {

int children;
int beard ;

} ou;

Mi

typedef struct human—being {
char name[10];

int age;

float salary;

date dob;

sex—type sex—info;

Mi

human—being personl, person2;

> We could assign values to person! and person? as:

personl.sex—info.sex = male;
personl.sex—info.u.beard = FALSE;

and
person2.sex=info.sex = female;
person2.sex-info.u.children - 4;

> we first place a value in the tag field. This allows us to determine which field in the union

is active. We then place a value in the appropriate field of the union.

Internal Implementation Of Structures
e The size of an object of a struct or union type is the amount of storage necessary to
represent the largest component, including any padding that may be required.
¢ Structures must begin and end on the same type of memory boundary, for example, an

even byte boundary or an address that is a multiple of 4, 8, or 16.
