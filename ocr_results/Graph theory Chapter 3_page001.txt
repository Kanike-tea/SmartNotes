: The following theorems contain some basic properties of trees.

heorem 1 , /n a treé, there is one and only one path between every pair of vertices,
a

Proof: Let 7 be a tree. Then Tfs a connected simple graph. Since T is connected, there may
be at least one path between every two vertices. If there are two paths between a pair Of Vertice,
| of 7, the union of the paths will become’a cycle, and.7 cannot be a‘tree. Thus, between every
| | pair of vertices in a tree there must exist one and only one path.

Theorem 2 . /f in a graph G there is one and only one path between every pair of Vertices, then
G isa tree, ; :

Proof: Since there is a path between every pair of vertices in G, it is obvious that G is con-
nected, Since there is only one path between every pair of vertices, G cannot have a cycle,
Because, if there is a cycle, then there exist two paths between two vertices on the cycle. Thus,
G is a connected graph containing no cycles. This means that G is a tree, .
The above two theorems may be combined together and put in the following form:
A graph G is a tree if and only if there is one and only one path between every pair of
vertices in G.

Theorem 3 . A tree with n vertices has n - 1 edges”.

Proof: We prove the theorem by induction on n.
4 The theorem is obvious for'n ="I, n = 2 and n = 3; see the trees‘in Figure 3.1.
Assume that the theorem holds for all trees with n vertices where n < k, for a specified
positive integer k. y
Consider a tree T with k + 1 vertices. In T, let e be an edge with end vertices u and ¥.
Since T is a tree, it has no cycles and therefore there exists no other edge or path between“
and y.,Hence, deletion of e from Twill disconnect the graph and.T.~ e consists of exactly tv
components, say 7) and 7. Since T does not contain any cycle, the components, and h
too do not contain any cycles. Hence, 7; and Tp are trees in their own right. Both of thes?
trees have Jess than k + 1 vertices each, and therefore, according to the assumption made, the
theorem holds for these trees; that is, each of T; and Ty contains one less edge than the number
of vertices in it. Therefore, since the total number of vertices in T, and T> (taken together) :
k + 1, the total number of edges in 7), and 7; (taken together) is (k + 1) -2 = k— 1. But™!

and Ty taken together is T - e, Thus, T — e contains k — 1 edges. Consequently, 7 has
k edges, :

“In other word. : : shat fo"
words, for a tree of n vertices and m edges, We have m = n — 1. Said al ively, this means
a tree T = (V, E), we have |E| = |V| 1, or equivalently |V| = |E|
