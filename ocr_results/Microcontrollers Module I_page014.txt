1. ARM Core Data Flow Model

Figure | show the ARM core data floe model in which the arrows represent the flow of data,
the lines represent the buses, and the boxes represent either an operation unit or a storage

area.

Fig 1: ARM Core Data Flow Model
The figure shows not only the flow of data but also the abstract components that make up an
ARM core.
Data enters the processor core through the Data bus. The data may be an instruction to
execute or a data item. Figure | shows a Von Neumann implementation of the ARM—data
items and instructions share the same bus. In contrast, Harvard implementations of the ARM
use two different buses.
The instruction decoder translates instructions before they are executed. Each instruction
executed belongs to a particular instruction set. The ARM processor uses load-store
architecture. This means it has two instruction types for transferring data in and out of the
processor:
Load instructions copy data from memory to registers in the core

Store instructions copy data from registers to memory.
