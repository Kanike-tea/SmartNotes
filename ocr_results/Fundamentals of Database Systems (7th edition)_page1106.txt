3. The subset of items containing i; from C; where support(ij) >= mins
becomes the frequent 1-itemset, L);

4. k=1;
termination = false;
repeat
1. Ley = (empty set);
2. Create the candidate frequent (k+1)-itemset, Cy,1, by combining mem-

bers of L; that have k-1 items in common (this forms candidate frequent
(k+1)-itemsets by selectively extending frequent k-itemsets by one item);

3. In addition, only consider as elements of C;,,, those k+1 items such that
every subset of size k appears in Ly

4. Scan the database once and compute the support for each member of Cy, ;; if
the support for a member of C;.,; >= mins then add that member to L,,;

5. If Lj,1 is empty then termination = true

elsek=k+ 1;
until termination;
End;

In the next iteration of the repeat-loop, we construct candidate frequent 3-itemsets
by adding additional items to sets in L,. However, for no extension of itemsets in L
will all 2-item subsets be contained in L,. For example, consider {milk, juice, bread};
the 2-itemset {milk, bread} is not in Lz, hence {milk, juice, bread} cannot be a fre-
quent 3-itemset by the downward closure property. At this point the algorithm ter-
minates with L, equal to {{milk}, {bread}, {juice}, {cookies}} and L, equal to {{milk,
juice}, {bread, cookies}}.

Several other algorithms have been proposed to mine association rules. They vary
mainly in terms of how the candidate itemsets are generated and how the supports
for the candidate itemsets are counted. Some algorithms use data structures such as
bitmaps and hashtrees to keep information about itemsets. Several algorithms have
been proposed that use multiple scans of the database because the potential number
of itemsets, 2”, can be too large to set up counters during a single scan. We will
examine three improved algorithms (compared to the Apriori algorithm) for asso-
ciation rule mining: the sampling algorithm, the frequent-pattern tree algorithm,
and the partition algorithm.

28.2.3 Sampling Algorithm

The main idea for the sampling algorithm is to select a small sample, one that fits
in main memory, of the database of transactions and to determine the frequent
itemsets from that sample. If those frequent itemsets form a superset of the frequent
itemsets for the entire database, then we can determine the real frequent itemsets by
scanning the remainder of the database in order to compute the exact support val-
ues for the superset itemsets. A superset of the frequent itemsets can usually be
