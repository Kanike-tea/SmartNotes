Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

The abstraction of association is used to associate objects from several independent
classes. Hence, it is somewhat similar to the second use of aggregation. It is repre-
sented in the EER model by relationship types, and in UML by associations. This
abstract relationship is called IS-ASSOCIATED-WITH.

In order to understand the different uses of aggregation better, consider the ER
schema shown in Figure 4.11(a), which stores information about interviews by
job applicants to various companies. The class COMPANY is an aggregation of
the attributes (or component objects) Cname (company name) and Caddress
(company address), whereas JOB_APPLICANT is an aggregate of Ssn, Name,
Address, and Phone. The relationship attributes Contact_name and Contact_phone
represent the name and phone number of the person in the company who is
responsible for the interview. Suppose that some interviews result in job offers,
whereas others do not. We would like to treat INTERVIEW as a class to associate it
with JOB_OFFER. The schema shown in Figure 4.11(b) is incorrect because it
requires each interview relationship instance to have a job offer. The schema
shown in Figure 4.11(c) is not allowed because the ER model does not allow rela-
tionships among relationships.

One way to represent this situation is to create a higher-level aggregate class com-
posed of COMPANY, JOB_APPLICANT, and INTERVIEW and to relate this class to
JOB_OFFER, as shown in Figure 4.11(d). Although the EER model as described in
this book does not have this facility, some semantic data models do allow it and call
the resulting object a composite or molecular object. Other models treat entity
types and relationship types uniformly and hence permit relationships among rela-
tionships, as illustrated in Figure 4.11(c).

To represent this situation correctly in the ER model as described here, we need to
create a new weak entity type INTERVIEW, as shown in Figure 4.11(e), and relate it to
JOB_OFFER. Hence, we can always represent these situations correctly in the ER
model by creating additional entity types, although it may be conceptually more
desirable to allow direct representation of aggregation, as in Figure 4.11(d), or to
allow relationships among relationships, as in Figure 4.11(c).

The main structural distinction between aggregation and association is that when
an association instance is deleted, the participating objects may continue to exist.
However, if we support the notion of an aggregate object—for example, a CAR that
is made up of objects ENGINE, CHASSIS, and TIRES—then deleting the aggregate
CAR object amounts to deleting all its component objects.

4.7.5 Ontologies and the Semantic Web

In recent years, the amount of computerized data and information available on
the Web has spiraled out of control. Many different models and formats are used.
In addition to the database models that we present in this text, much information
is stored in the form of documents, which have considerably less structure than
