SOLIDWORKS and CATIA are utilized to make the 3D bio printed tissue model in a layered
fashion. Main construction is utilized in the next in processing phase by utilizing bioink
composed of various growth factors, some cellular materials (ESCs, MSCs, iPSCs, etc.) and
many cellular or synthetic materials can act as scaffold. The final step is the post-processing
step that occurred in a bioreactor for full maturation and to make ready to be utilized
appendage in vivo). Another process of Bone bioprinting is described to be done via a two-
steps process that include, synthesis of methacrylatedethanolamide, a gelatin (GE-MA)
derivative, at first step followed by photochemical co-crosslinking by methacrylated
hyaluronic acid (HA-MA)that produces fluid having gel-like consistency, which is
biocompatible enough to support cell adhesion and proliferation

9. With a neat sketch, explain Bio computing and imaging in detail.

Answer: Biocomputing — a cutting-edge field of technology — operates at the
intersection of biology, engineering, and computer science. It seeks to use cells or their
sub-component molecules (such as DNA or RNA) to perform functions traditionally
performed by an electronic computer. The ultimate goal of bio-computing is to mimic
some of the biological ‘hardware’ of bodies like ours — and to use it for our computing
needs. From less to more complicated, this could include:

| Using DNA or RNA as a medium of information storage and data processing

“| Connecting neurons to one another, similar to how they are connected in our brains

(| Designing computational hardware from the genome level up

Cells Already Compute

Cells are far more powerful at computing than our best computers. For example:

Cells store data in DNA

Receive chemical inputs in RNA (data input)

Perform complex logic operations using ribosomes
Produce outputs by synthesizing proteins

Biocomputing’s engineering challenge is to gain a granular level of control of the reactions
between organic compounds like DNA or RNA.
