Format for Bibliographic Citations

Book titles are in boldface—for example, Database
Computers. Conference proceedings names are in
italics—for example, ACM Pacific Conference. Journal
names are in boldface—for example, TODS or
Information Systems. For journal citations, we give
the volume number and issue number (within the
volume, if any) and date of issue. For example, “TODS,
3:4, December 1978” refers to the December 1978 issue
of ACM Transactions on Database Systems, which is
Volume 3, Number 4. Articles that appear in books or
conference proceedings that are themselves cited in the
bibliography are referenced as “in” these references—
for example, “in VLDB [1978]” or “in Rustin [1974].”
Page numbers (abbreviated “pp.”) are provided with pp.
at the end of the citation whenever available. For cita-
tions with more than four authors, we will give the first
author only followed by et al. In the selected bibliogra-
phy at the end of each chapter, we use et al. if there are
more than two authors.
