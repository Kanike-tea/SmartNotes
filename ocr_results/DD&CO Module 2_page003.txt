the sum and carry. We assign symbols x and y to the two inputs and S (for sum) and C (for carry) to the
outputs. The truth table for the half adder is listed in Table below. The C output is 1 only when both
inputs are 1. The S output represents the least significant bit of the sum.

The logic diagram of the half adder implemented in sum of products is shown in Fig.(a). It can be also
implemented with an exclusive-OR and an AND gate as shown in Fig.(b)

Full Adder

A full adder is a combinational circuit that forms the arithmetic sum of three bits. It consists of three
inputs and two outputs. Two of the input variables, denoted by x and y, represent the two significant bits
to be added. The third input, z, represents the carry from the previous lower significant position. s. The
two outputs are designated by the symbols S for sum and C for carry. The binary variable S gives the
value of the least significant bit of the sum. The binary variable C gives the output carry formed by
adding the input carry and the bits of the words. The truth table of the full adder is listed in Table below.
The eight rows under the input variables designate all possible combinations of the three variables. The
output variables are determined from the arithmetic sum of the input bits. When all input bits are 0, the
output is 0. The S output is equal to 1 when only one input is equal to 1 or when all three inputs are equal
to 1. The C output has a carry of 1 if two or three inputs are equal to 1.
