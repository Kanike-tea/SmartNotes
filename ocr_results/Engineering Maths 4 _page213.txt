(a) 121 = 2m isacircle with centre at origin and radius 2%

We :hins to evaluate the integral which can be written in the form

The point z = a = ~im isthe point P(0,—7) lies within the circle |z1 =2n

We have Cauchy’s integral formula pf dz = 2ni f(a)

Wehave, f(z) =, a=~in

Thus J dz = -2mi, where C isthecircle |z| = 22
