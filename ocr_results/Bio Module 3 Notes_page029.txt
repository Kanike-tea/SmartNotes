Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

CKD stands for Chronic Kidney Disease. It is a long-term condition in which the kidneys
gradually become less able to function properly. It can be caused by a variety of factors,
including diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health problems that damage the kidneys.

Symptoms of CKD include fatigue, swelling in the legs and feet, trouble sleeping, and
difficulty concentrating. As the disease progresses, it can lead to more serious complications,
such as anemia, nerve damage, and an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.

Treatment for CKD may include lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and
exercising regularly, as well as medications to manage symptoms and underlying health conditions.
In severe cases, kidney transplant or dialysis may be necessary.

It is important for individuals with risk factors for CKD to get regular check-ups and to talk
to their doctor about how to best manage their condition.

Dialysis Systems

Dialysis is a medical treatment that helps to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood
when the kidneys are unable to function properly. There are two main types of dialysis systems:
hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

Hemodialysis is a procedure that uses a machine to clean the blood. During hemodialysis,
blood is removed from the body, passed through a dialysis machine that filters out waste and excess
fluids, and then returned to the body. Hemodialysis typically takes place in a hospital or dialysis
center, and is typically performed three times a week for three to four hours at a time.

Peritoneal dialysis is a type of dialysis that uses the lining of the abdomen, called the
peritoneum, to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. A sterile solution is introduced into
