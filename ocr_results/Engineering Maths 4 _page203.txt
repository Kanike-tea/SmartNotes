But pOrreae is: cos(n+1)2n+isin(nt+1) 2n=1+i-0=1
cos2kn = +1 and sin2kn=0 for k = 1,2,3,...

Thus we have proved that, J (z-a) az= {¢ if n#-1

Statement: If f(z) is analytic at all points inside and on asimple closed curve C

then frcz) dz=0.

' Proof: Let f(z) =utiv

Then f f(z).dz = J (utiv) (de +idy)

We have Green's theorem in a plane stating that if M (x, y) and N(x,y) are two
real valued functions having continuous first order peat derivatives in a region R
bounded by the curve C then

Applying this theorem to the two line integrals in the RHS of (1) we obtain,

Since f G z) is analytic, we have Cauchy-Riemann equations :

oa = ae. ef = nau and hence wehave..

Jreve= N(55- 5) = axidy ti i see
Thus we get ff(zydz= 0. , ma

This proves Cauchy's theorem.
