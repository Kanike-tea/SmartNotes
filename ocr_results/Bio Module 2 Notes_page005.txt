Production of PHAs

1.

Microbial Fermentation: Bacteria such as Cupriavidus necator, Pseudomonas spp.,
and Bacillus spp. synthesize PHAs under nutrient-limited conditions with excess
carbon sources.

Feedstocks: Can be derived from sugarcane, vegetable oils, industrial waste, and even
CO>.

Extraction & Processing: Harvested from bacterial cells and purified for plastic

production.

Engineering applications of PHA bioplastic

Packaging: PHA is used in various forms of packaging such as food containers,
beveragecups, and clamshell containers.

Medical Devices: PHA is biocompatible and can be used in the manufacture of
medicaldevices such as sutures, implants, and drug delivery systems.

Textiles: PHA is used in the production of biodegradable textiles, as well as for the
production of biodegradable composites for use in construction and furniture.
Agricultural Mulch Films: PHA is used in the production of biodegradable mulch
films for agriculture to reduce soil erosion and conserve moisture.

Consumer Goods: PHA is used in the production of various consumer goods, such as
toys,phone cases, and water bottles.

Automotive Parts: PHA is used for the production of biodegradable automotive parts
such asair ducts and headlamp covers.

Electronic Devices: PHA is used for the production of biodegradable components in
electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.

Aerospace: PHA is used for the production of biodegradable parts in aerospace
applications,such as insulation and cable management.

Sporting Goods: PHA is used for the production of biodegradable sporting goods
such asgolf tees and fishing lures.

Construction: PHA is used for the production of biodegradable insulation and

soundproofingmaterials.
