AHB provides higher data throughput than ASB because it uses a centralized multiplexed bus
scheme instead of ASB's bidirectional bus28 . AHB can run at higher clock speeds and supports
widths of 64 and 128 bits28 . ARM introduced variations of AHB:

Multi-layer AHB: Allows multiple active bus masters simultaneously, which is beneficial for systems
with multiple processors29 ....

AHB-Lite: A subset of AHB limited to a single bus master, designed for simpler systems30 .

An example device might have multiple buses: an AHB for high-performance peripherals, an APB for
slower peripherals, and potentially other buses for external or proprietary peripherals, connected via
bridges29 . The physical level of a bus covers electrical characteristics and bus width, while the
protocol level defines the logical rules for communication26 . Devices connected to the bus can be
bus masters (capable of initiating data transfers) or bus slaves (only responding to transfer
requests)25 ....

ARM Processor Dataflow Diagram

Figure 1 (not provided here, but described) shows the ARM core data flow model, illustrating how
data and instructions move within the core31 .

Data enters the core through the Data bus32 . The figure represents a Von Neumann
implementation, where data items and instructions share the same bus32 . (Harvard
implementations would use two separate buses32 ).

The Instruction Decoder translates fetched instructions32 .

The ARM core uses a load-store architecture, with Load instructions copying data from memory to
registers and Store instructions copying data from registers to memory33 . Data processing
instructions operate solely on registers33 .

Data items are stored in the Register File, a bank of 32-bit registers34 .

ARM instructions typically use two source registers (Rn and Rm) and one destination register (Rd).
Source operands are read from the register file using internal buses A and B34 .
