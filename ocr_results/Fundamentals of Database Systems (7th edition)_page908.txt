List the support offered by operating systems to a DDBMS and also the ben-
efits of these supports.

Discuss the factors that do not appear in centralized systems but that affect
concurrency control and recovery in distributed systems.

Discuss the two-phase commit protocol used for transaction management
in a DDBMS. List its limitations and explain how they are overcome using
the three-phase commit protocol.

Compare the primary site method with the primary copy method for dis-
tributed concurrency control. How does the use of backup sites affect each?

When are voting and elections used in distributed databases?
Discuss catalog management in distributed databases.

What are the main challenges facing a traditional DDBMS in the context of
today’s Internet applications? How does cloud computing attempt to address
them?

. Discuss briefly the support offered by Oracle for homogeneous, heteroge-

neous, and client/server-based distributed database architectures.

Discuss briefly online directories, their management, and their role in dis-
tributed databases.

Consider the data distribution of the COMPANY database, where the frag-
ments at sites 2 and 3 are as shown in Figure 23.3 and the fragments at site 1
are as shown in Figure 3.6. For each of the following queries, show at least
two strategies of decomposing and executing the query. Under what condi-
tions would each of your strategies work well?

a. For each employee in department 5, retrieve the employee name and the
names of the employee's dependents.

b. Print the names of all employees who work in department 5 but who
work on some project not controlled by department 5.

Consider the following relations:

BOOKS (Book#, Primary_author, Topic, Total_stock, $price)
BOOKSTORE (Store#, City, State, Zip, Inventory_value)
STOCK(Store#, Book#, Qty)

Total_stock is the total number of books in stock, and Inventory_value is the
total inventory value for the store in dollars.

a. Give an example of two simple predicates that would be meaningful for
the BOOKSTORE relation for horizontal partitioning.
