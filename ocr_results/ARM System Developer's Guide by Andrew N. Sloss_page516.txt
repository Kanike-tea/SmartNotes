LI page table entries.

A section page table entry points to a 1 MB section of memory. The upper 12 bits of
the page table entry replace the upper 12 bits of the virtual address to generate the physical
address. A section entry also contains the domain, cached, buffered, and access permission
attributes, which we discuss in Section 14.6.

A coarse page entry contains a pointer to the base address of a second-level coarse page
table. The coarse page table entry also contains domain information for the 1 MB section
of virtual memory represented by the L1 table entry. For coarse pages, the tables must be
aligned on an address multiple of 1 KB.

A fine page table entry contains a pointer to the base address of a second-level fine page
table. The fine page table entry also contains domain information for the 1 MB section of
virtual memory represented by the LI table entry. Fine page tables must be aligned on an
address multiple of 4 KB.

A fault page table entry generates a memory page fault. The fault condition results in
either a prefetch or data abort, depending on the type of memory access attempted.

The location of the L1 master page table in memory is set by writing to the CP15:c2
register.

14.4.2. THE L1 TRANSLATION TABLE BASE ADDRESS

‘The CP15:c2 register holds the translation table base address (TTB)—an address pointing
to the location of the master L1 table in virtual memory. Figure 14.7 shows the format of
CP15:c2 register.
