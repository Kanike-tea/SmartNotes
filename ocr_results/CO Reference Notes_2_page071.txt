© The full adder is input with three partial bit products in the first row.

© Multiplication requires the addition of several summands.

* CSA speeds up the addition process.

© Consider the array for 4x4 multiplication shown in fig 9.16.

« First row consisting of just the AND gates that implement the bit products m3q0, m2q0, m1q0 and m0q0.

¢ The delay through the carry-save array is somewhat less than delay through the ripple-carry array. This is
because the S and C vector outputs from each row are produced in parallel in one full-adder delay.

© Consider the addition of many summands in fig 9.18.

© Group the summands in threes and perform carry-save addition on each of these groups in parallel to
generate a set of S and C vectors in one full-adder delay

© Group all of the S and C vectors into threes, and perform carry-save addition on them, generating a
further set of S and C vectors in one more full-adder delay

© Continue with this process until there are only two vectors remaining

© They can be added in a RCA or CLA to produce the desired product.

© When the number of summands is large, the time saved is proportionally much greater.

* Delay: AND gate + 2 gate/CSA level + CLA gate delay, Eg., 6 bit number require 15 gate delay,
array 6x6 require 6(n-1)-1 = 29 gate Delay.

In general, CSA takes 1.7 log2k-1.7 levels of CSA to reduce k summands

Problem 1:
Represent the decimal values 5, -2, 14, -10, 26, -19, 51 and -43 as signed 7-bit numbers in the
following binary formats:
(a) sign-and-magnitude
(b) 1’s-complement
(c) 2’s-complement
Solution:
The three binary representations are given as:

Decimal | Sign-and-magnitude | 1’s-complement | recs

values representation | representation | representation
5 0000101 0000101 0000101

-2 1000010 1111101 1111110

14 0001110 0001110 0001110
—10 1001010 1110101 1110110
26 0011010 0011010 0011010

19 1010011 1101100 1101101

51 0110011 0110011 0110011
—43 1101011 1010100 1010101
