Adding operations to
the definitions of
EMPLOYEE and
DEPARTMENT.

define class EMPLOYEE

type tuple (_ Fname: string;
Minit: char;
Lname: string;
Ssn: string;
Birth_date: DATE;
Address: string;
Sex: char;
Salary: float;
Supervisor: EMPLOYEE;
Dept: DEPARTMENT; );

operations age: integer;
create_emp: EMPLOYEE;
destroy_emp: boolean;

end EMPLOYEE;
define class DEPARTMENT

type tuple (| Dname: string;
Dnumber: integer;
Mgr: tuple ( Manager: EMPLOYEE;
Start_date:  DATE;);
Locations: set (string);
Employees: set (EMPLOYEE);
Projects set(PROJECT); );
operations no_of_emps: integer;
create_dept: DEPARTMENT;
destroy_dept: boolean;

assign_emp(e: EMPLOYEE): boolean;

(* adds an employee to the department *)

remove_emp(e: EMPLOYEE): boolean;

(* removes an employee from the department *)
end DEPARTMENT;

An operation is typically applied to an object by using the dot notation. For exam-
ple, ifd is a reference to a DEPARTMENT object, we can invoke an operation such as
no_of_emps by writing d.no_of_emps. Similarly, by writing d.destroy_dept, the object
referenced by d is destroyed (deleted). The only exception is the constructor opera-
tion, which returns a reference to a new DEPARTMENT object. Hence, it is custom-
ary in some OO models to have a default name for the constructor operation that is
the name of the class itself, although this was not used in Figure 12.2.” The dot notation
is also used to refer to attributes of an object—for example, by writing d.Dnumber or
d.Mgr_Start_date.

Default names for the constructor and destructor operations exist in the C++ programming language.
For example, for class EMPLOYEE, the default constructor name is EMPLOYEE and the default
destructor name is ~EMPLOYEE. It is also common to use the new operation to create new objects.
