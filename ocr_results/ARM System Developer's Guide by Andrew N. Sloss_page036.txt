8-bit instructions. We will discuss Jazelle more in Section 2.2.3. It is highly probable that
future designs will assign extra bits for the monitoring and control of new features.

2.2.1 PROCESSOR MODES

‘The processor mode determines which registers are active and the access rights to the cpsr
register itself. Each processor mode is either privileged or nonprivileged: A privileged mode
allows full read-write access to the cpsr. Conversely, a nonprivileged mode only allows read
access to the control field in the cpsr but still allows read-write access to the condition flags.

There are seven processor modes in total: six privileged modes (abort, fast interrupt
request, interrupt request, supervisor, system, and undefined) and one nonprivileged mode
(user).

The processor enters abort mode when there is a failed attempt to access memory. Fast
interrupt request and interrupt request modes correspond to the two interrupt levels available
on the ARM processor. Supervisor mode is the mode that the processor is in after reset and
is generally the mode that an operating system kernel operates in. System mode is a special
version of user mode that allows full read-write access to the cpsr. Undefined mode is used
when the processor encounters an instruction that is undefined or not supported by the
implementation. User mode is used for programs and applications.

2.2.2 BANKED REGISTERS

Figure 2.4 shows all 37 registers in the register file. Of those, 20 registers are hidden from
a program at different times. These registers are called banked registers and are identified
by the shading in the diagram. They are available only when the processor is in a particular
