Simplify the following Boolean functions to a minimum number of literals.

X(x' + y) = xx! + xy =0 + xy = xy.

1.
2xtxy=H(xtx)\xty)=laxty)=xty.
3. (x + yx ty’) =x t+xytxy’ + yy’ =x tyty’) =x.
4. xy +x'z t+ yz =xy + x'z + yz(x + x’)

=xy +x'z + xyz + x'yz
y(1 +z) + x'z(1 + y)

=xy t+ x'z.

5. (x + y)(x' + z)(y + z) = (v + y)(X' + Z), by duality from function 4.

Complement of a Function

The complement of a function F is F and is obtained from an interchange of 0’s for 1’s and 1’s for 0’s
in the value of F. The complement of a function may be derived algebraically through DeMorgan’s
theorems. The three-variable form of the first DeMorgan’s theorem is derived as follows, from postulates

and theorems listed

(A+B+O)'=(A+x)' letB+C=x
= A'x' by theorem 5(a) (DeMorgan)
= A'(B + C)’ substitute B + C =x
= A'(B'C') by theorem 5(a) (DeMorgan)
= A'B'C' by theorem 4(b) (associative)

Digital Logic gates

Since Boolean functions are expressed in terms of AND, OR, and NOT operations, it is easier to
implement a Boolean function with these type of gates. Factors to be weighed in considering the

construction of other types of logic gates are:

(1) The feasibility and economy of producing the gate with physical components,
(2) The possibility of extending the gate to more than two inputs,
(3) The basic properties of the binary operator, such as commutativity and associativity, and

(4) The ability of the gate to implement Boolean functions alone or in conjunction with other gates

The NAND function is the complement of the AND function, as indicated by a graphic symbol that
consists of an AND graphic symbol followed by a small circle. The NOR function is the complement of
the OR function and uses an OR graphic symbol followed by a small circle. NAND and NOR gates are
