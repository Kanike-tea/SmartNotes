Hence (4) as a consequence of (5) and (6) becomes,

Since x = cos 8, the equation becomes

This equation can be-written in the: following standard form.

(1 a dx + n(nt1)y = 0
This is the Legendre’s differential equation in the standard form originating from the
Laplace equation in the spherical system.

Series Solution of Differential Equation

We discuss the method of finding solution of a second order homogeneous differential
equation in the form of convergent infinite power series.

Subsequently we extend / generalize this method which is referred to as seated
power series method or Frobenius method.

© Power series solution of a second order ODE
Consider the DE in the form

where Py(x).P; (x)and P, (x) are polynomials in x with P,(x) # Oatx = 0.
