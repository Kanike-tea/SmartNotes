Aggregate function operation can be defined by using the symbol 3 (script F) :

<grouping attributes> <5 <function list> (R)

Where ,

<grouping attributes> : list of attributes of the relation specified in R

<function list> : list of (<function> <attribute>) pairs.

<function> - such as SUM, AVERAGE, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM,COUNT

<attribute> is an attribute of the relation specified by R
The resulting relation has the grouping attributes plus one attribute for each element in the function
list.
Example: To retrieve each department number, the number of employees in the department, and

their average salary, while renaming the resulting attributes

PR(Dno, No_of employees, Average_sal)(Dno § COUNT ssn, AVERAGE Salary (EMPLOYEE))

2.5.3 Recursive Closure Operations
Recursive closure operation is applied to a recursive relationship between tuples of the same type,
such as the relationship between an employee and a supervisor.
Example : Retrieve all supervisees of an employee e at all levels—that is, all employees e’ directly
supervised by e, all employees e’3 directly supervised by each employee e’, all employees e’’’
directly supervised by each employee e”’ and so on.
