1.21. Vertex degree and Handshaking prope: 35

For a graph with n vertices and m edges, if 6 is the minimum and A is the
maximum of the degrees of vertices, show that

p Let di, d2, d3,.--.dn be the degrees of the vertices. Then, by handshaking property, we

have
dy + dy +d3t++++ +d, = 2m. (i)

Since 6 = min(d), d2,d3,...,dn), we have

Adding these n inequalities, we get

dy + dy +++ +dy 2 n6. (ii)
Similarly, since A = max(d},d2,...,dn), we get
dy tdy te: td, sn. (iii)
From (i), (ii) and (iii), we get 2m > né and 2m < nA, so that nd < 2m <n,
