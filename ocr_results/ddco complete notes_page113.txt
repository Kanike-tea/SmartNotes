the starting addressof the memory block.

Saring ass [sd

Word-Count register:
The format of word count register is as shown in fig. It is used to store the no of

eT

Status and Controller register:

31 30 1 0

IRQ a | L Done
IE R/W
a)DONE bit:

e The DMA controller sets this bit to 1 when it completes the direct data
transfer between mainmemory and external devices.
e This information is informed to CPU by means of DONE bit.

b)R/W (Read or Write):

e This bit is used to differentiate between memory read or memory write
operation.

e The R/W = 1 for read operation and

= 0 for write operation.

e When this bit is set to 1, DMA controller transfers the one block of data
rom external deviceto main memory.

e When this bit is set to 0, DMA controller transfers the one block of data

rom main memoryto external device.
