Graph databases are a category of NoSQL databases that use graph structures to store, map,
and query relationships between data. Instead of organizing data in rows and columns like
relational databases, graph databases represent data as:

e Nodes - These are entities or objects such as users, products, or locations.

e Edges (or Relationships) — These define how nodes are related to each other (e.g.,
“LIKES”, “FRIEND_OF”, “PURCHASED”).

« Properties — Key-value pairs associated with nodes and relationships, storing
metadata (e.g., age, date, status).

The graph model mirrors real-world relationships more naturally than tables, making it
exceptionally useful for applications that need to handle complex, connected data.

2. Why Use Graph Databases?

Relational databases use joins to represent relationships, which become computationally
expensive and slow as the number of tables and relationships grows. In contrast, graph
databases store relationships directly in the database, making traversals (e.g., finding all
friends of friends) very fast — often in constant time regardless of data size.

Key benefits include:
« High performance for relationship queries
e Intuitive data modeling
e Flexibility in schema (no rigid structure)

¢ Efficient handling of deeply connected data

3. Core Concepts in Graph Databases
« Nodes: Represent entities (e.g., Person, Movie, Product).

« Edges (Relationships): Connect nodes and can be directional (e.g., (User)-
[:FOLLOWS]->(User)).

« Properties: Metadata about nodes or edges, like (User {name: 'Alice'}).
Example:
Scss
CopyEdit

(Alice)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(Bob)
