2. It is a minimal superkey—that is, a superkey from which we cannot remove any
attributes and still have the uniqueness constraint in condition 1 hold.This property is
not required by a superkey.

Example: Consider the STUDENT relation

« The attribute set {Ssn} is a key of STUDENT because no two student tuples can
have the same value for Ssn

« Any set of attributes that includes Ssn—for example, {Ssn, Name, Age}—is a
superkey

« The superkey {Ssn, Name, Age} is not a key of STUDENT because removing

Name or Age or both from the set still leaves us with a superkey

In general, any superkey formed from a single attribute is also a key. A key with multiple

attributes must require all its attributes together to have the uniqueness property.

Candidate key
A relation schema may have more than one key. In this case, each of the keys is called a
candidate key. For example, the CAR relation has two candidate keys: License_number and

Engine. serial_number

CAR

[_License_number | Engine_serial_number Make Model | Year
Texas ABC-739 A69352 Ford Mustang | 02
Florida TVP-347 B43696 Oldsmobile | Cutlass | 05
New York MPO-22 X83554 Oldsmobile | Delta 01
California 432-TFY C43742 Mercedes | 190-D 99
California RSK-629 Y82935 Toyota Camry 04
Texas RSK-629 U028365 Jaguar US 04
