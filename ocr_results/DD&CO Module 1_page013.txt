Prime Implicants

In choosing adjacent squares in a map, we must ensure that (1) all the minterms of the function are
covered when we combine the squares, (2) the number of terms in the expression is minimized, and (3)

there are no redundant terms (i.e., minterms already covered by other terms).

A prime implicant is a product term obtained by combining the maximum possible number of adjacent
squares in the map. If a minterm in a square is covered by only one prime implicant, that prime implicant

is said to be essential.

The prime implicants of a function can be obtained from the map by combining all possible maximum
numbers of squares. This means that a single | on a map represents a prime implicant if it is not adjacent

to any other 1’s.
