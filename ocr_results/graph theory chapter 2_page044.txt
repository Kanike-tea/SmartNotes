> Let us denote the given graph by G and the edge {vj, V5} as e. Then the graphs G, and G,
would be as shown below.

Let us redesignate G, as H and denote the edge {vs, v2} by f. Then the graphs Hy and Hy;
are as shown below.

Now, we note that H’. is the union of the cycles vjv4v2v1 and v2Vv3v4v2 each of which is the
Same as K3, and that the intersection of these cycles is the edge {v4, v2} which is the same as
