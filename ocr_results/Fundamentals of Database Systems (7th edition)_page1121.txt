28.5.1 Discovery of Sequential Patterns

The discovery of sequential patterns is based on the concept of a sequence of item-
sets. We assume that transactions such as the supermarket-basket transactions we
discussed previously are ordered by time of purchase. That ordering yields a
sequence of itemsets. For example, {milk, bread, juice}, {bread, eggs}, {cookies,
milk, coffee} may be such a sequence of itemsets based on three visits by the same
customer to the store. The support for a sequence S of itemsets is the percentage of
the given set U of sequences of which S is a subsequence. In this example, {milk,
bread, juice} {bread, eggs} and {bread, eggs} {cookies, milk, coffee} are considered
subsequences. The problem of identifying sequential patterns, then, is to find all
subsequences from the given sets of sequences that have a user-defined minimum
support. The sequence Sj, S3, $3, ... is a predictor of the fact that a customer who
buys itemset S, is likely to buy itemset S, and then S;, and so on. This prediction is
based on the frequency (support) of this sequence in the past. Various algorithms
have been investigated for sequence detection.

28.5.2 Discovery of Patterns in Time Series

Time series are sequences of events; each event may be a given fixed type of a
transaction. For example, the closing price of a stock or a fund is an event that
occurs every weekday for each stock and fund. The sequence of these values per
stock or fund constitutes a time series. For a time series, one may look for a
variety of patterns by analyzing sequences and subsequences as we did above.
For example, we might find the period during which the stock rose or held
steady for n days, or we might find the longest period over which the stock had
a fluctuation of no more than 1% over the previous closing price, or we might
find the quarter during which the stock had the most percentage gain or percent-
age loss. Time series may be compared by establishing measures of similarity to
identify companies whose stocks behave in a similar fashion. Analysis and min-
ing of time series is an extended functionality of temporal data management (see
Chapter 26).

28.5.3 Regression

Regression is a special application of the classification rule. If a classification rule is
regarded as a function over the variables that maps these variables into a target
class variable, the rule is called a regression rule. A general application of regres-
sion occurs when, instead of mapping a tuple of data from a relation to a specific
class, the value of a variable is predicted based on that tuple. For example, consider
a relation
