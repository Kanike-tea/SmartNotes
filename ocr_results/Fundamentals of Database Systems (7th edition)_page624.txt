Why is accessing a disk block expensive? Discuss the time components
involved in accessing a disk block.

How does double buffering improve block access time?

What are the reasons for having variable-length records? What types of sep-
arator characters are needed for each?

Discuss the techniques for allocating file blocks on disk.
What is the difference between a file organization and an access method?
What is the difference between static and dynamic files?

What are the typical record-at-a-time operations for accessing a file? Which
of these depend on the current file record?

Discuss the techniques for record deletion.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using (a) an unordered file,
(b) an ordered file, and (c) a static hash file with buckets and chaining.
Which operations can be performed efficiently on each of these organiza-
tions, and which operations are expensive?

Discuss the techniques for allowing a hash file to expand and shrink dynam-
ically. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

What is the difference between the directories of extendible and dynamic
hashing?

What are mixed files used for? What are other types of primary file organi-
zations?

Describe the mismatch between processor and disk technologies.
What are the main goals of the RAID technology? How does it achieve them?

How does disk mirroring help improve reliability? Give a quantitative
example.

What characterizes the levels in RAID organization?
What are the highlights of the popular RAID levels 0, 1, and 5?
What are storage area networks? What flexibility and advantages do they offer?

Describe the main features of network-attached storage as an enterprise
storage solution.

. How have new iSCSI systems improved the applicability of storage area

networks?
What are SATA, SAS, and FC protocols?

What are solid-state drives (SSDs) and what advantage do they offer over
HDDs?
