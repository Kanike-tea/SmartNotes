Picard’s Method for first order and first degree ODE

This method gives the solution of the initial value problem in the form ofa power series
in x from which’ we can find the value of y at any number of values of x in the
neighbourhood of the initial value Xq. The method is as follows.

‘Consider the first order differential equation: |

a = f(x,y) with the initial condition ¥(%) =

_ Thatis, dy = f(x,y) dx ; Y= Yo at x=x,

Integrating LHS between Yo and y,RHS between X) and x we have,

The first approximation y, is obtained by putting y = Yo in f(x,y) and

integrating the same. That is,

The second approximation Yp is obtained by putting y = y, in f (x,y) of (1) and
integrating the same. That is

Continuing like this we get a series of approximations y, , y> ,
