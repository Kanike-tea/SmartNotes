user cannot get indirectly in Y what he or she cannot get directly in X. Active flow
control began in the early 1970s. Most flow controls employ some concept of security
class; the transfer of information from a sender to a receiver is allowed only if the
receiver's security class is at least as privileged as the sender’s. Examples of a flow con-
trol include preventing a service program from leaking a customer’s confidential data,
and blocking the transmission of secret military data to an unknown classified user.

A flow policy specifies the channels along which information is allowed to move. The
simplest flow policy specifies just two classes of information—confidential (C) and
nonconfidential (N)—and allows all flows except those from class C to class N. This
policy can solve the confinement problem that arises when a service program handles
data such as customer information, some of which may be confidential. For example,
an income-tax-computing service might be allowed to retain a customer’s address
and the bill for services rendered, but not a customer’s income or deductions.

Access control mechanisms are responsible for checking users’ authorizations for
resource access: Only granted operations are executed. Flow controls can be
enforced by an extended access control mechanism, which involves assigning a
security class (usually called the clearance) to each running program. The program
is allowed to read a particular memory segment only if its security class is as high as
that of the segment. It is allowed to write in a segment only if its class is as low as
that of the segment. This automatically ensures that no information transmitted by
the person can move from a higher to a lower class. For example, a military pro-
gram with a secret clearance can only read from objects that are unclassified and
confidential and can only write into objects that are secret or top secret.

Two types of flow can be distinguished: explicit flows, which occur as a consequence
of assignment instructions, such as Y:= f(X,,X,,); and implicit flows, which are gen-
erated by conditional instructions, such as if f(Xjy.1, .., Xn) then Y= f (X1,Xyn)-

Flow control mechanisms must verify that only authorized flows, both explicit and
implicit, are executed. A set of rules must be satisfied to ensure secure information
flows. Rules can be expressed using flow relations among classes and assigned to
information, stating the authorized flows within a system. (An information flow
from A to B occurs when information associated with A affects the value of infor-
mation associated with B. The flow results from operations that cause information
transfer from one object to another.) These relations can define, for a class, the set
of classes where information (classified in that class) can flow, or can state the spe-
cific relations to be verified between two classes to allow information to flow from
one to the other. In general, flow control mechanisms implement the controls by
assigning a label to each object and by specifying the security class of the object.
Labels are then used to verify the flow relations defined in the model.

30.6.1 Covert Channels

A covert channel allows a transfer of information that violates the security or the
policy. Specifically, a covert channel allows information to pass from a higher
classification level to a lower classification level through improper means. Covert
