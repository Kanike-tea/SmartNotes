Rule 9 : Logical data independence.

"Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired when information-
preserving changes of any kind that theoretically permit un-impairment are made to the base
tables."

User programs and the user should not be aware of any changes to the structure of the tables (such
as the addition of extra columns).

Rule 10 : Integrity independence.

"Integrity constraints specific to a particular relational data base must be definable in the relational
data sub-language and storable in the catalog, not in the application programs."

If a column only accepts certain values, then it is the RDBMS which enforces these constraints and
not the user program, this means that an invalid value can never be entered into this column, whilst
if the constraints were enforced via programs there is always a chance that a buggy program might
allow incorrect values into the system.

Rule 11 : Distribution independence.

"A relational DBMS has distribution independence."

The RDBMS may spread across more than one system and across several networks, however to the
end-user the tables should appear no different to those that are local.

Rule 12 : Non-subversion Rule.

"If a relational system has a low-level (single-record-at-a-time) language, that low level cannot be
used to subvert or bypass the integrity Rules and constraints expressed in the higher level relational
language (multiple-records-at-a-time)."
