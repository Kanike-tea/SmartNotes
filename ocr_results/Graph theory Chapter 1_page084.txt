18 Baler circuits and Euler trails 87

Therefore, by Theorem 1, G has an Euler circuit.

Conversely, suppose G has an Euler circuit. Then, by Theorem 1, every vertex in G is of
pven degree. Now, consider a vertex ¥; in G. Since v, is of even degree, there are at least two
adges incident on v;. Choose one of these edges, and let v2 be the other end vertex of this
chosen) edge. Then v2 is also of even degree, and therefore there must be at least one other
edge incident on v2. Choose one of such edges, and let v3 be the other end vertex of the edge.
proceeding like this, we eventually arrive at a vertex that has previously been traversed, thus
forming a cycle C;. Let us remove C; from G. All vertices in the resulting graph must also be
of even degree, and in this graph we can construct a cycle C) as was done in G. Remove this
cycle Cz and proceed as above. The process ends when no edges are left. In this way we get a
sequence of cycles whose union is G and whose intersection is a null graph. Thus, G has been
decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles.

This completes the proof of the theorem. °

Find all positive integers n(> 2) for which the complete graph K, contains an
Euler circuit. For which n does K,, have an Euler trail but not an Euler circuit?

» Form = 2, the graph K,, contains exactly one edge. This edge together with its end vertices
constitutes an Euler trail. In this case, K, cannot have an Euler circuit. For n > 3, K, contains
an Euler circuit if and only if m — 1 (which is the degree of every vertex in K,) is even; that is
if and only if n is odd. s
(a) Does there exist an Euler graph with even number of vertices and odd

number of edges?

(b) Does there exist an Euler graph with odd number of vertices and even number of edges?

> (a) Yes. Suppose C is a circuit with even number of vertices. Let v be one of these vertices.
Consider a circuit C’ with odd number of vertices passing through v such that C and C’
have no edge in common. The circuit q that consists of the edges of C and C’ is an Euler

graph of the desired type.

(®) Yes. In (a), suppose C and C’ are circuits with odd number of vertices. Then g is an
Euler graph of the desired type. a

Show that a connected graph with exactly two vertices of odd degree has an

Euler trail.

i Let A and B be the only two vertices of odd degree in a connected graph G. Join these
“ices by an edge e (even if there is already an edge between them). Then A and B become
