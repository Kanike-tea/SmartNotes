An illustration of the theorem’... .

Supposea coin is tossed 3 times and we wish to know the probability of getting 2 heads. °

The possibilities are as follows. .
HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT

We see that there are eight possibilities out of which only 3 possibilities are favourable
to the event. They are HHT, HTH, THH.

Thus the probability of getting 2 heads is ‘3/8. Cos
Now we shall obtain the probability. of the event by Bernoulli’s theorem.
Number of trials n = 3 ea : a
Number of successes (getting 2 heads) ‘x = 2 . :
Probability of success (p) = Probability of getting a head = 1/2
Probability of failure (q) = 1-p = 1/2 "4

Remark :. Bernoulli's. theorem leads to Binomial Distribution and a limiting case Of this
distribution leads to Poisson Distribution. These are Discrete Probability Distributions.
We proceed to discuss these in detail. 7
Binomial Distribution
If p is the probability of success and q is the probability of failure, the probability of
x successes out of n trialsis givenby ~ ;

We form the following probability distribution of [x, P(x)] wire.

It may be observed that the value of P(x) for different values x = 0,1,2,-:-n

are the successive terms in the binomial expansion of (q+p)" and accordingly this
distribution is called the Binomial Distribution or Bernoulli Distribution.

Hence. P(x) is a probability function.
