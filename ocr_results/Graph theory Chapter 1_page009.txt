In diagrams depicting non-null graphs, an edge is represented by a line. The line may be
straight or curved, long or short. The important thing is that the diagram should represent the
vertices and edges correctly, irrespective of whether the edges are drawn as straight lines or as
curves.

The way one draws a diagram of a graph is basically immaterial. There can be more
than one diagram for the same graph. For instance, the two diagrams in Figure 1.15(a) and
1.15(b) look different, yet they represent the same graph since each coveys the same informa-
tion, namely that the graph has four vertices A, B, C, D with AB, AC, AD, BC and CD as edges.
For brevity in terminology, a diagram of a graph itself is often referred to as a graph.
