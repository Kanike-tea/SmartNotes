DON’T-CARE CONDITIONS

> The logical sum of the minterms associated with a Boolean function specifies the
conditions under which the function is equal to 1. The function is equal to O for
the rest of the minterms. This pair of conditions assumes that all the
combinations of the values for the variables of the function are valid.

> In some applications the function is not specified for certain combinations of the
variables.

> Functions that have unspecified outputs for some input combinations are called
incompletely specified functions.

> In most applications, we simply don’t care what value is assumed by the
function for the unspecified minterms. For this reason, it is customary to call the
unspecified minterms of a function don’t-care conditions. These don’t-care
conditions can be used on a map to provide further simplification of the Boolean
expression.

> A don’t-care minterm is a combination of variables whose logical value is not
specified. Such a minterm cannot be marked with a 1 in the map, because it
would require that the function always be a 1 for such a combination. Likewise,
putting a O on the square requires the function to be O. To distinguish the don’t-
care condition from 1’s and 0’s, an X is used.

> Thus, an X inside a square in the map indicates that we don’t care whether the
value of 0 or 1 is assigned to F for the particular minterm.

> In choosing adjacent squares to simplify the function in a map, the don’t-care
min- terms may be assumed to be either 0 or 1. When simplifying the function,
we can choose to include each don’t-care minterm with either the 1’s or the 0’s,
depending on which combination gives the simplest expression.

Simplify the Boolean function
F (w, x, y, Z)= (1, 3, 7, 11, 15)which has the don’t-care conditions
d (w, x, y, z)= (0, 2, 5)

The minterms of F are the variable combinations that make the function equal to 1. The
minterms of d are the don’t-care minterms that may be assigned either 0 or 1. The map
simplification is shown in Fig. 3.15. The minterms of F are marked by 1’s, those of d are
marked by X’s, and the remaining squares are filled with 0O’s. To get the simplified
expres- sion in sum-of-products form, we must include all five 1’s in the map, but we
may or may not include any of the X’s, depending on the way the function is simplified.
The term yz covers the four minterms in the third column.The remaining minterm, m1,
can be combined
