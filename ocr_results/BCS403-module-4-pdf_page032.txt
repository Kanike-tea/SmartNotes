2. The Temporary Update (or Dirty Read) Problem

= occurs when one transaction updates a database item and then the transaction fails for
some reason

» Meanwhile the updated item is accessed by another transaction before it is changed back
to its original value

qt Th

read_item(X);
X=X-N;
write_item(X);

Time read_item(X);
X=X+M;
write_item(X);
Transaction 7; fails;and must change
read _item(Y); the value of X back to its old value;
meanwhile T, has read the temporary
incorrect value of X.

3. The Incorrect Summary Problem
+ If one transaction is calculating an aggregate summary function on a number of db items
while other transactions are updating some of these items, the aggregate function may

calculate some values before they are updated and others after they are updated.

i if

sum = 0;
read_item(A);
sum = sum + A;

read item(X);
X=X-N;
write_item(X);
pecan a 7 Tareads X after Nis subtracted and reads
ay). | | Y before NV is added; a wrong summary
read_item(Y); is
te . is the result (off by N)
sum = sum + Y;
read_item(¥);
Y=Y+N;
write_item(Y);
