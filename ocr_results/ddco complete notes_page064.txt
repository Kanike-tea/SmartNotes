T Flipflop using JK Flipflop

T = 0 J = K = 0), a clock edge does not change the output. When T = 1 (J = K=1),a
clock edge complements the output. The complementing flip-flop is useful for

designing binary counters.

Implementation of TFF using DFF

The T flip-flop can be constructed with a D flip-flop and an exclusive-OR gate as
shown in Fig. (b). The expression for the D input is D = T ® Q = T’Q + TQ’ When T =
0, D = Q and there is no change in the output. When T = 1, D = Q’ and the output

complements.
D=T*Q
D=T’Q+TQ’
