Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module III

If the root is NULL, the search tree contains no nodes and the search is unsuccessful.

we compare k with the key in root. If k equals the root's key, then the search terminates
successfully.

Ifk is less than root's key, then, we search the left subtree of the root.

Ifk is larger than root's key value, we search the right subtree of the root.

Structure of the node can be defined as follows

struct node

{
Struct node *Ichild;

struct

{

int item; /* Itype represents the data type of the element*/
int key;

}data;

Struct node *rchild;

aa

Typedef struct node TreeNode;

Recursive search of a binary search tree: Return a pointer to the element whose key is k, if there
is no such element, return NULL. We assume that the data field of the element is of type elemenet
and it has two components key and item.

Treenode * search(TreeNode * tree, int k)

{

}

if (tree==NULL) return NULL;
if (k == tree—data.key)
return (tree);
if (k < treedata.key)
return search(tree—leftChild, k);
return search(tree—rightChild, k);

Iterative search of a Binary Search tree

Treenode* iterSearch(TreeNode * tree, int k)

{
while (tree!=null)
{
if (k == treedata.key)
return (tree);
if (k < tree—data.key)
tree = tree—leftChild;
else
tree = treerightChild;
}
return NULL;
