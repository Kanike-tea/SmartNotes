e There are some contrasting features between plant and animal cells. For e.g., the
plant cell contains chloroplast, central vacuoles, and other plastids, whereas the
animal cells do not.

3. Explain the structure and functions of cell with neat labelled diagram.

Ans. Understanding cell structure and functions is key to understanding life processes.

Structure:

1. Plasma Membrane: Surrounds the cell, regulating the passage of substances.

2.Cytoplasm: Jelly-like substance filling the cell, containing organelles.

3. Nucleus: Houses genetic material (DNA), controlling cell activities.

4. Organelles: Specialized structures:

a. Endoplasmic Reticulum: Involved in protein and lipid metabolism.
b. Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, sorts, and packages molecules.

c. Mitochondria: Generates energy through respiration.

d. Lysosomes: Break down waste materials.

e. Ribosomes: Sites of protein synthesis.

f. Centrioles (in animals): Assist in cell division.

g. Cytoskeleton: Provides structural support and aids in cell movement.
