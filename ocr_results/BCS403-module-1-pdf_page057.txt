Database Management System [BCS403]

Because they have several common attributes, they can be generalized into the entity type
VEHICLE, as shown in Figure 3.8.2(b). Both CAR and TRUCK are now subclasses of the
generalized superclass VEHICLE.

A diagrammatic notation to distinguish between generalization and specialization is used in some
design methodologies. An arrow pointing to the generalized superclass represents a generalization,

whereas arrows pointing to the specialized subclasses represent a specialization.
