Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

to specify their requests and are typically middle- or high-level managers or
other occasional browsers.

= Naive or parametric end users make up a sizable portion of database
end users. Their main job function revolves around constantly querying
and updating the database, using standard types of queries and updates—
called canned transactions—that have been carefully programmed and
tested. Many of these tasks are now available as mobile apps for use with
mobile devices. The tasks that such users perform are varied. A few
examples are:

© Bank customers and tellers check account balances and post withdrawals
and deposits.

O Reservation agents or customers for airlines, hotels, and car rental com-
panies check availability for a given request and make reservations.

& Employees at receiving stations for shipping companies enter package
identifications via bar codes and descriptive information through buttons
to update a central database of received and in-transit packages.

© Social media users post and read items on social media Web sites.

= Sophisticated end users include engineers, scientists, business analysts, and
others who thoroughly familiarize themselves with the facilities of the DBMS
in order to implement their own applications to meet their complex require-
ments.

= Standalone users maintain personal databases by using ready-made pro-
gram packages that provide easy-to-use menu-based or graphics-based
interfaces. An example is the user of a financial software package that stores
a variety of personal financial data.

A typical DBMS provides multiple facilities to access a database. Naive end users
need to learn very little about the facilities provided by the DBMS; they simply have
to understand the user interfaces of the mobile apps or standard transactions
designed and implemented for their use. Casual users learn only a few facilities that
they may use repeatedly. Sophisticated users try to learn most of the DBMS facilities
in order to achieve their complex requirements. Standalone users typically become
very proficient in using a specific software package.

1.4.4 System Analysts and Application Programmers
(Software Engineers)

System analysts determine the requirements of end users, especially naive and
parametric end users, and develop specifications for standard canned transactions
that meet these requirements. Application programmers implement these specifi-
cations as programs; then they test, debug, document, and maintain these canned
transactions. Such analysts and programmers—commonly referred to as software
developers or software engineers—should be familiar with the full range of capa-
bilities provided by the DBMS to accomplish their tasks.
