4.1. Trees and their Basic properties 155

Thus, if the theorem is true for a tree with n < k vertices, it is true for a tree with n =k +1
vertices. Hence, by induction, the theorem is true for >I Positive integers n. °

‘Pheorem 4 . Any connected graph with n vertices andn — 1 edges is a tree.

Proof: Let G be a connected graph with n vertices and n — 1 edges. Assume that G is aot a
tree. Then G contains a cycle, say C. Let e be an edge in C. The graph G will not become
disconnected if e is deleted (see Figure 8.1). Thus, G — e is a connected graph. But, on the
other hand, G — e has n vertices and n — 2 edges; therefore, it cannot be connected.* This is a
contradiction. Hence, G must not have a cycle; this means that G must be a tree.

This completes the proof of the theorem. °

Remark: A disconnected graph with n vertices and n — 1:edges need not be a tree; see the
graph shown below (which is disconnected and has 4 vertices and'3 edges).

Theorems 3 and 4 can be put together in the following combined form: /
A graph with n vertices is a tree if and only if it is connected and has n —\ edges. UA
