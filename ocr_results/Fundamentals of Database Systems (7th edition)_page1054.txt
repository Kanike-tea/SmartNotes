view about a historical issue, a scientist verifying a claim by another scientist, or
a person trying to shop for clothing). Designing systems suitable for different
types of users is an important topic of IR that is typically studied in a field
known as Human-Computer Information Retrieval.

Types of Data. Search systems can be tailored to specific types of data. For exam-
ple, the problem of retrieving information about a specific topic may be handled
more efficiently by customized search systems that are built to collect and retrieve
only information related to that specific topic. The information repository could
be hierarchically organized based on a concept or topic hierarchy. These topical
domain-specific or vertical IR systems are not as large as or as diverse as the generic
World Wide Web, which contains information on all kinds of topics. Given that
these domain-specific collections exist and may have been acquired through a
specific process, they can be exploited much more efficiently by a specialized sys-
tem. Types of data can have different dimensions, such as velocity, variety, vol-
ume, and veracity. We discussed these in Section 25.1.

Types of Information Need. In the context of Web search, users’ information
needs may be defined as navigational, informational, or transactional.° Naviga-
tional search refers to finding a particular piece of information (such as the
Georgia Tech University Web site) that a user needs quickly. The purpose of
informational search is to find current information about a topic (such as
research activities in the college of computing at Georgia Tech—this is the clas-
sic IR system task). The goal of transactional search is to reach a site where
further interaction happens resulting in some transactional event (such as join-
ing a social network, shopping for products, making online reservations,
accessing databases, and so on).

Levels of Scale. In the words of Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon,

“What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its
recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a
need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of informa-
tion sources that might consume it.”*

This overabundance of information sources in effect creates a high noise-to-signal
ratio in IR systems. Especially on the Web, where billions of pages are indexed, IR
interfaces are built with efficient scalable algorithms for distributed searching, index-
ing, caching, merging, and fault tolerance. IR search engines can be limited in level
to more specific collections of documents. Enterprise search systems offer IR solu-
tions for searching different entities in an enterprise’s intranet, which consists of the
network of computers within that enterprise. The searchable entities include e-mails,
corporate documents, manuals, charts, and presentations, as well as reports related
to people, meetings, and projects. Enterprise search systems still typically deal with
hundreds of millions of entities in large global enterprises. On a smaller scale, there
are personal information systems such as those on desktops and laptops, called
