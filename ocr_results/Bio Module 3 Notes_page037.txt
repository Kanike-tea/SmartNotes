Construction of a Pacemaker

The construction of a pacemaker involves the use of high-quality materials and specialized
manufacturing processes to ensure their safety and reliability. Materials used in the
construction of pacemakers include:

O) Medical-grade plastics: Medical-grade plastics, such as polycarbonate, are used to
construct the exterior of the device and to provide insulation and protection for the internal
components.

U Metals: Metals, such as stainless steel and titanium, are used in the construction of the leads
and electrodes to ensure their durability and long-lasting performance.

0 Electronic components: Electronic components, such as microprocessors, batteries, and
capacitors, are used to control the delivery of the electrical impulses and to provide power to
the device.

0) Adhesives: Adhesives, such as cyanoacrylate and epoxy, are used to secure the components
of the device and to provide insulation and protection for the internal components.

The manufacturing process for pacemakers includes multiple quality control measures to
ensure their safety and reliability. This includes testing of individual components and final
assembly testing to verify the proper operation of the device before it is released for use.
