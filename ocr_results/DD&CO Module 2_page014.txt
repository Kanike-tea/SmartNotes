enabled and I; has a path to the output. The multiplexer acts like an electronic switch that selects one of
two sources. The block diagram of a multiplexer is sometimes depicted by a wedge-shaped symbol, as
shown in Fig. The multiplexer is often labeled “MUX” in block diagrams.

Two-to-One-line multiplexer

Four-to-One-line multiplexer

A four-to-one-line multiplexer is shown in Fig below. Each of the four inputs, Io through 1s, is applied
to one input of an AND gate. Selection lines S; and So are decoded to select a particular AND gate. The
outputs of the AND gates are applied to a single OR gate that provides the one-line output.

To demonstrate the operation of the circuit, consider the case when S1So = 10. The AND gate associated
with input lb has two of its inputs equal to | and the third input connected to I. The other three AND
gates have at least one input equal to 0, which makes their outputs equal to 0. The output of the OR gate
is now equal to the value of lL, providing a path from the selected input to the output. A multiplexer is
also called a data selector, since it selects one of many inputs and steers the binary information to the
output line.

Four-to-One-line Multiplexer

The AND gates and inverters in the multiplexer resemble a decoder circuit, and indeed, they decode the
selection input lines. In general, a 2"-to-1-line multiplexer is constructed from an n -to-2" decoder by
adding 2" input lines to it, one to each AND gate. The outputs of the AND gates are applied to a single
OR gate. The n selection lines are implied from the 2” data lines. As in decoders, multiplexers may have
an enable input to control the operation of the unit. When the enable input is in the inactive state, the
outputs are disabled, and when it is in the active state, the circuit functions as a normal multiplexer.
