1154 Chapter 30 Database Security

data mining algorithms minimizes the exchange of data needed to develop globally
valid models. By modifying, perturbing, and anonymizing data, we can also miti-
gate privacy risks associated with data mining. This can be done by removing iden-
tity information from the released data and injecting noise into the data. However,
by using these techniques, we should pay attention to the quality of the resulting
data in the database, which may undergo too many modifications. We must be able
to estimate the errors that may be introduced by these modifications.

Privacy is an important area of ongoing research in database management. It is
complicated due to its multidisciplinary nature and the issues related to the subjec-
tivity in the interpretation of privacy, trust, and so on. As an example, consider
medical and legal records and transactions, which must maintain certain privacy
requirements. Providing access control and privacy for mobile devices is also
receiving increased attention. DBMSs need robust techniques for efficient storage
of security-relevant information on small devices, as well as trust negotiation tech-
niques. Where to keep information related to user identities, profiles, credentials,
and permissions and how to use it for reliable user identification remains an impor-
tant problem. Because large-sized streams of data are generated in such environ-
ments, efficient techniques for access control must be devised and integrated with
processing techniques for continuous queries. Finally, the privacy of user location
data, acquired from sensors and communication networks, must be ensured.

30.9 Challenges to Maintaining
Database Security

Considering the vast growth in volume and speed of threats to databases and infor-
mation assets, research efforts need to be devoted to a number of issues: data qual-
ity, intellectual property rights, and database survivability, to name a few. We
briefly outline the work required in a few important areas that researchers in data-
base security are trying to address.

30.9.1 Data Quality

The database community needs techniques and organizational solutions to assess
and attest to the quality of data. These techniques may include simple mechanisms
such as quality stamps that are posted on Web sites. We also need techniques that
provide more effective integrity semantics verification and tools for the assessment
of data quality, based on techniques such as record linkage. Application-level recov-
ery techniques are also needed for automatically repairing incorrect data. The ETL
(extract, transform, load) tools widely used to load data in data warehouses (see
Section 29.4) are presently grappling with these issues.

30.9.2 Intellectual Property Rights

With the widespread use of the Internet and intranets, legal and informational
aspects of data are becoming major concerns for organizations. To address these
