1.1 Carbohydrates:

Carbohydrates are a class of organic compounds that play a crucial role in biology and are an
important source of energy for living organisms. They are composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and
oxygen (O) atoms and are classified based on their molecular structure and function. General formula is
Cn(H20)n. Types of carbohydrates are as follows,

Monosaccharides

These are the simplest form of carbohydrates and include glucose and fructose. They are easily

Disaccharides

These are formed by the condensation of two monosaccharides and include sucrose, lactose, and

maltose. They are commonly found in sugar and are broken down into monosaccharides during digestion.
