25.6 General Discussion

Recently, caching techniques have been shown to improve the performance of
MapReduce jobs for various workloads.”° The PACMan framework provides sup-
port for in-memory caching, and the MixApart system provides support for disk-
based caching when the data is stored in an enterprise storage server within the
same site. Caching techniques allow flexibility in that data is stored in a separate
storage infrastructure that allows prefetching and caching of the most essential
data. Recent work*” has addressed the big data caching problem in the context of
privacy-conscious scenarios, wherein data stored in encrypted form in a public
cloud must be processed in a separate, secure enterprise site.

In addition to the data locality problem, one of the most challenging goals for cloud
providers is to optimally provision virtual clusters for jobs while minimizing the
overall consumption cost of the cloud data center.

An important focus of cloud resource optimization is to optimize globally across all
jobs in the cloud as opposed to per-job resource optimizations. A good example of
a globally optimized cloud- managed system is the recent Google BigQuery sys-
tem,”8 which allows Google to run SQL-like queries against very large datasets with
potentially billions of rows using an Excel-like interface. In the BigQuery service,
customers only submit the queries to be processed on the large datasets, and the
cloud system intelligently manages the resources for the SQL-like queries. Simi-
larly, the Cura resource optimization model”? proposed for MapReduce in a cloud
achieves global resource optimization by minimizing the overall resource utiliza-
tion in the cloud as opposed to per-job or per-customer resource optimization.

25.6.4 YARN as a Data Service Platform

The separation of resource management from application management has taken
Hadoop to another level as a platform. Hadoop v1 was all about MapReduce. In
Hadoop v2, MapReduce is one of the many application frameworks that can run on.
the cluster. As we discussed in Section 25.5, this has opened the door for many services
(with their own programming models) to be provided on YARN. There is no need to
translate all data processing techniques and algorithms into a set of MapReduce jobs.
MapReduce is presently being used only for batch-oriented processing such as the
ETL (extract, transform, load) process in data warehouses (see Chapter 29). The
emerging trend is to see Hadoop as a data lake, where a significant portion of enter-
prise data resides and where processing happens. Traditionally, HDFS has been
where an enterprise’s historical data resides because HDFS can handle the scale of
such data. Most new sources of data, which in today’s search and social networking
applications come from Web and machine logs, clickstream data, message data (as
in Twitter) and sensor data, also is being stored largely in HDFS.
