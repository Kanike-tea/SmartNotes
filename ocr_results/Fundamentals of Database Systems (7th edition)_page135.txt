Selected Bibliography

constraints on relationships are discussed in Abrial (1974), Elmasri and Wieder-
hold (1980), and Lenzerini and Santucci (1983). Multivalued and composite attri-
butes are incorporated in the ER model in Elmasri et al. (1985). Although we did
not discuss languages for the ER model and its extensions, there have been several
proposals for such languages. Elmasri and Wiederhold (1981) proposed the
GORDAS query language for the ER model. Another ER query language was pro-
posed by Markowitz and Raz (1983). Senko (1980) presented a query language for
Senko’s DIAM model. A formal set of operations called the ER algebra was
presented by Parent and Spaccapietra (1985). Gogolla and Hohenstein (1991) pre-
sented another formal language for the ER model. Campbell et al. (1985) presented
a set of ER operations and showed that they are relationally complete. A conference
for the dissemination of research results related to the ER model has been held reg-
ularly since 1979. The conference, now known as the International Conference on
Conceptual Modeling, has been held in Los Angeles (ER 1979, ER 1983, ER 1997),
Washington, D.C. (ER 1981), Chicago (ER 1985), Dijon, France (ER 1986), New
York City (ER 1987), Rome (ER 1988), Toronto (ER 1989), Lausanne, Switzerland
(ER 1990), San Mateo, California (ER 1991), Karlsruhe, Germany (ER 1992),
Arlington, Texas (ER 1993), Manchester, England (ER 1994), Brisbane, Australia
(ER 1995), Cottbus, Germany (ER 1996), Singapore (ER 1998), Paris, France (ER
1999), Salt Lake City, Utah (ER 2000), Yokohama, Japan (ER 2001), Tampere, Fin-
land (ER 2002), Chicago, Illinois (ER 2003), Shanghai, China (ER 2004), Klagen-
furt, Austria (ER 2005), Tucson, Arizona (ER 2006), Auckland, New Zealand (ER
2007), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain (ER 2008), and Gramado, RS, Brazil (ER 2009).
The 2010 conference was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (ER2010),
2011 in Brussels, Belgium (ER2011), 2012 in Florence, Italy (ER2012) , 2013 in
Hong Kong, China (ER2013), and the 2014 conference was held in Atlanta, Georgia
(ER 2014). The 2015 conference is to be held in Stockholm, Sweden.
