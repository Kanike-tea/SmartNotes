Microcontrollers — BCS402

ADC | add two 32-bit values and carry Rd = Rn+ N+ carry
ADD | add two 32-bit values Rd = Rn+N
RSB | reverse subtract of two 32-bit values Rd=N-—Rn

RSC | reverse subtract with carry of two 32-bit values | Rd = N — Rn—'(carry flag)

SBC | subtract with carry of two 32-bit values Rd = Rn— N—‘(carry flag)

SUB | subtract two 32-bit values Rd = Rn—N

Where N is the result of the shifter operation

Example 1:
SUB r0,r1,r2; rO=rl —r2

This simple subtract instruction subtracts a value stored in register r2 from a value stored in

register rl. The result is stored in register r0.
PRE 10 = 0x00000000, rl = 0x00000002, r2 = 0x00000001 POST r0 = 0x00000001
Example 2:

RSB r0,r1, #0 ; Rd = 0x0 - rl

This reverse subtract instruction (RSB) subtracts rl from the constant value #0, writing the

result to r0. This instruction can be used to negate numbers.
PRE 10 = 0x00000000, rl = 0x00000077 POST 10 = -rl = Oxffffff89
Example 3:

SUBS rl,rl1,#1; rl =rl-1

The SUBS instruction is useful for decrementing loop counters. In this example we subtract
the immediate value one from the value one stored in register rl. The result value zero is

written to register rl. The cpsr is updated with the ZC flags being set.
PRE cpsr = nzcvqiFt_USER, rl = 0x00000001

POST cepsr = nZCvqiFt_USER, rl = 0x00000000
