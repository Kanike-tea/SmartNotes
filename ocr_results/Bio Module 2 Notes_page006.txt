Polylactic Acid (PLA) is a biodegradable and bio-based plastic made from corn

starch, sugarcane, or other natural resources.

It is commonly used as a sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based
plastics in various applications such as packaging, disposable tableware, and 3D printing.
However, it's important to note that while PLA is biodegradable in industrial composting

facilities, it may not break down in the environment as quickly as advertised and may still

have negative impacts on wildlife and ecosystems if not properly disposed of.

Properties of PLA as bioplastic

e Biodegradable: PLA can be broken down by microorganisms in industrial composting
facilities, reducing waste in landfills.

e Renewable: PLA is derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane,
reducing dependence on finite petroleum resources.

e Clear/Transparent: PLA has a clear and transparent appearance, making it suitable for
packaging applications.

e Heat-resistant: PLA has a relatively low melting temperature and is not recommended
forhigh heat applications, but it can maintain its shape and stability up to 60°C.

¢ Biocompatible: PLA is non-toxic and biocompatible, making it suitable for food
packagingand medical devices.

e Stiffness and Strength: PLA has good stiffness and strength, but not as strong as
traditionalpetroleum-based plastics.

e Printability: PLA is commonly used in 3D printing due to its good printability and

ease of use.

Production of PLA

PLA is produced through a multi-step process involving the fermentation of plant-based sugars

and polymerization of lactic acid.
