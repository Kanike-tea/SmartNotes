1.3 Exception Priori

Fig 2: Example vector table

ities

Exceptions can occur simultaneously, so the processor has to adopt a priority mechanism.

Table 3 shows the various exceptions that occur on the ARM processor and their associated

priority level.

For instance, the Reset exception is the highest priority and occurs when power is applied to the

processor. Thus, when a reset occurs, it takes precedence over all other exceptions.

Similarly, when a Data Abort occurs, it takes precedence over all other exceptions apart from a

Reset exception.

The lowest priority level is shared by two exceptions, the Software Interrupt and Undefined

Instruction exceptions.

Certain exceptions also disable interrupts by setting the I or F bits in the cpsr, as shown in Table

3.
