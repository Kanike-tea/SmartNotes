28.3 Classification

28.3 Classification

Classification is the process of learning a model that describes different classes of
data. The classes are predetermined. For example, in a banking application, cus-
tomers who apply for a credit card may be classified as a poor risk, fair risk, or good
risk. Hence this type of activity is also called supervised learning. Once the model
is built, it can be used to classify new data. The first step—learning the model—is
accomplished by using a training set of data that has already been classified. Each
record in the training data contains an attribute, called the class label, which indi-
cates which class the record belongs to. The model that is produced is usually in the
form of a decision tree or a set of rules. Some of the important issues with regard to
the model and the algorithm that produces the model include the model’s ability to
predict the correct class of new data, the computational cost associated with the
algorithm, and the scalability of the algorithm.

We will examine the approach where our model is in the form of a decision tree. A
decision tree is simply a graphical representation of the description of each class or, in
other words, a representation of the classification rules. A sample decision tree is pic-
tured in Figure 28.5. We see from Figure 28.5 that if a customer is married and if sal-
ary = 50K, then she is a good risk for a bank credit card. This is one of the rules that
describe the class good risk. Traversing the decision tree from the root to each leaf node
forms other rules for this class and the two other classes. Algorithm 28.3 shows the pro-
cedure for constructing a decision tree from a training data set. Initially, all training sam-
ples are at the root of the tree. The samples are partitioned recursively based on selected
attributes. The attribute used at a node to partition the samples is the one with the best
splitting criterion, for example, the one that maximizes the information gain measure.
