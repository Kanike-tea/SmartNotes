656 Appendix D_ Instruction Cycle Timings

Table D.8 StrongARM1 (ARMv4) instruction cycle timings.

Instruction class Cycles Notes

ALU 1 +1 if a register-specified shift is used [even if the instruction is not
executed].
+2 if Rdis pc (only if executed].

B, BL 2

LDR/B/H Rd not pe 1 Rdis not available for one cycle.

LDRSB/SH Rd not pe 2 Rdis not available for one cycle.

LDR Rd is pe 4

LDM N = 1, not pe 2 [2 cycles if not executed.]

LDM N > 1, not pe N The last loaded value is not available for one cycle.
(N cycles if not executed.]

LDM loading pe N+3 [max(N,2) if not executed.]

MRS 1 Rais not available for one cycle.

MSR to cpsr 3 +1 if any of the csx fields are updated.

MSR to spsr 1

MUL, MLA M Rdis not available for one cycle. You cannot start another multiply
on the next cycle.

MULS, MLAS 4

xMULL, xMLAL 14+M RdHi is not available for one cycle. You cannot start a multiply on
the next cycle. [2 if instruction not executed.]

xMULLS, xMLALS 5 (2 if instruction not executed.]

STR/B/H 1

STM N +1ifN=1.
{Same number of cycles if not executed.]

SUP/B 2 (2 if instruction not executed.]

D.5 ARMSE INSTRUCTION CYCLE TIMINGS

‘The ARMOE core is based on a five-stage pipeline. There is usually a one- or two-cycle delay
following a load or multiply instruction before you can use the data. The multiplier circuit
uses a 32-bit by 16-bit multiplier array. The multiplier does not terminate early. Table D.9
gives the ARM9E instruction cycle timings.
