Construction of defibrillators
The construction of defibrillators involves the use of high-quality materials and specialized
manufacturing processes to ensure their safety and reliability.

Materials Used

Materials used in the construction of defibrillators include:

O Medical-grade plastics: Medical-grade plastics, such as polycarbonate, are used to
construct the exterior of the device and to provide insulation and protection for the internal
components.

0 Metals: Metals, such as stainless steel and titanium, are used in the construction of the leads
and electrodes to ensure their durability and long-lasting performance.

O Electronic components: Electronic components, such as microprocessors, batteries,
capacitors, and high-voltage transformers, are used to control the delivery of the electrical
impulses and to provide power to the device.

0 Adhesives: Adhesives, such as cyanoacrylate and epoxy, are used to secure the components
of the device and to provide insulation and protection for the internal components.

The manufacturing process for defibrillators includes multiple quality control measures to
ensure their safety and reliability. This includes testing of individual components and final
assembly testing to verify the proper operation of the device before it is released for use.

Basic Design

The basic design of a defibrillator consists of:

O Power source: The power source, typically a battery, provides energy to deliver the
electrical impulses to the heart.

U Electrodes: The electrodes are placed on the chest and deliver the electrical impulses to the
heart to restore normal rhythm.

O Circuitry: The circuitry in the defibrillator controls the delivery of the electrical impulses,
including the timing, strength, and duration of the impulses.

UO Display: A display on the defibrillator provides information about the heart rhythm, battery
life, and other relevant information.

Artificial Heart

An artificial heart is a device that is designed to replace the functions of a damaged or failing
heart. It can be used as a temporary measure to support a patient while they are waiting for a
heart transplant, or as a permanent solution for people who are not eligible for a heart transplant.
