Table 8.1 Operations of Relational Algebra

OPERATION PURPOSE NOTATION

SELECT Selects all tuples that satisfy the selection Oselection condition>(R)
condition from a relation R.

PROJECT Produces a new relation with only some of the Tattibute tists (R)
attributes of R, and removes duplicate tuples.

THETA JOIN Produces all combinations of tuples from Rj; Ry join conditions Ry
and R; that satisfy the join condition.

EQUUOIN Produces all the combinations of tuples from Ry ™ coin condition» R2, OR
R, and R; that satisfy a join condition with Ry (<oin attributes 1>),
only equality comparisons. (<join attributes 2>) Ra

NATURAL JOIN Same as EQUUOIN except that the join attributes — Ry*<join conditions Ro»
of R, are not included in the resulting relation; OR R)* (<join attributes 1>),
if the join attributes have the same names, they _(<join attributes 2>)
do not have to be specified at all. R, OR R, * Ro

UNION Produces a relation that includes all the tuples = Ry U Ry
in R, or R; or both Rj and R; Ry and Rj must
be union compatible.

INTERSECTION Produces a relation that includes all the tuples = Ry A Ry
in both R; and R; R; and Ry must be union
compatible.

DIFFERENCE Produces a relation that includes all the tuples Ry - Ry
in R; that are not in R; Rj and Ry must be
union compatible.

CARTESIAN PRODUCT Produces a relation that has the attributes of R, x Ry
R, and R; and includes as tuples all possible
combinations of tuples from R, and Ro.

DIVISION Produces a relation R(X) that includes all tuples R(Z) + Ro(Y)

t{X] in R,(Z) that appear in Ry; in combination
with every tuple from R3(Y), where Z= XU Y.

on the relational schema of Figure 5.5 and corresponds to the following relational

algebra expression:

Tepnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate  ( (OPiocation=‘Stafford’(PROJECT))
4 Dnum=Dnumber(DEPARTMENT)) * igc_ssn=Ssn(EMPLOYEE))

In Figure 8.9, the three leaf nodes P, D, and E represent the three relations PROJECT,
DEPARTMENT, and EMPLOYEE. The relational algebra operations in the expression are
represented by internal tree nodes. The query tree signifies an explicit order of execu-
tion in the following sense. In order to execute Q2, the node marked (1) in Figure 8.9
must begin execution before node (2) because some resulting tuples of opera-
tion (1) must be available before we can begin to execute operation (2). Similarly,
