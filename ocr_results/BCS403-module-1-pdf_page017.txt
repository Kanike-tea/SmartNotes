Database Management System [BCS403]

Chapter 2: Overview of Database Languages and Architectures

Introduction

The architecture of DBMS packages has evolved from the early monolithic systems, where the
whole DBMS software package was one tightly integrated system. Modern DBMS packages are
modular in design, with a client/server system architecture. In a basic client/server DBMS
architecture, the system functionality is distributed between two types of module. A client
module is designed to run on a user workstation or personal computer. The

client module handles user interaction and provides the user-friendly interfaces.such.as forms- or
menu-based GUIs. The other kind of module, called a server module handles data storage, access,

search, and other functions

2.1 Data Models, Schemas, and Instances.

Data Model

A data model is a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database. By
structure of a database we mean the data types, relationships and constraints that apply to the data.
Most data models also include a set. of basic operations for specifying retrievals and updates on the

database. Data model provides the necessary means to achieve abstraction.

Categories of Data Models
Data models can be categorized according to the types of concepts they use to describe the
database structure.

1. High-level or conceptual data models: provide concepts that are close to the way many
users perceive data. Conceptual data models use concepts such as entities, attributes, and
relationships.

2. Representational or implementation data models: provide concepts that may be easily
understood by end users but that are not too far removed from the way data is organized in
computer storage. Representational data models hide many details of data storage on disk
but can be implemented on a computer system directly. Representational or implementation
data models are the models used most frequently
in traditional commercial DBMSs. These include the widely used relational

data model, as well as the so-called legacy data models—the network and hierarchical
