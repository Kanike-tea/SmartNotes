CHAPTER

DIGITAL SIGNAL
PROCESSING

Microprocessors now wield enough computational power to process real-time digitized
signals. You are probably familiar with mp3 audio players, digital cameras, and digital
mobile/cellular telephones. Processing digitized signals requires high memory bandwidths
and fast multiply accumulate operations. In this chapter we will look at ways you can
maximize the performance of the ARM for digital signal processing (DSP) applications.

Traditionally an embedded or portable device would contain two types of processor:
A microcontroller would handle the user interface, and a separate DSP processor would
manipulate digitized signals such as audio. However, now you can often use a single
microprocessor to perform both tasks because of the higher performance and clock fre-
quencies available on microprocessors today. A single-core design can reduce cost and
power consumption over a two-core solution.

Additions to the ARM architecture mean that ARM is well suited for many DSP
applications. The ARMVSTE extensions available in the ARM9E and later cores provide
efficient multiply accumulate operations. With careful coding, the ARM9E processor will
perform decently on the DSP parts of an application while outperforming a DSP on the
control parts of the application.

DSP applications are typically multiply and load-store intensive. A basic operation
is a multiply accumulate multiplying two 16-bit signed numbers and accumulating onto
a 32-bit signed accumulator. Table 8.1 shows the increase in performance available on
different generations of the ARM core. The second column gives cycles for a signed 16-bit
by 16-bit multiply with 32-bit accumulate; the third column, cycles for a signed 32-bit by
32-bit multiply with a 64-bit accumulate. The latter is especially useful for high-quality
audio algorithms such as mp3.

Table 8.1 assumes that you use the most efficient instruction for the task and that you
can avoid any postmultiply interlocks. We cover this in detail in Section 8.2.
