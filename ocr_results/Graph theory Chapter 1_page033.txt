36 1, Directed ants,

we have d(v) = id(v) + od(v) for any v € V. Ip

For an underlying graph of a digraph,
tpt 1 for every v € V. Therefore, if Ky is the Unde

underlying graph is Kn, we have d(v) = "=
graph of the given digraph D, we have

id(v) + od(v) = n= 1 forevery veD.

Now, we find that
x [ od(v))? = tia)? = Yio) + id(v)}{od(v) = id(v)}

This gives
Yioawy? = Heider

as required.
