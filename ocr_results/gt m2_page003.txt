Fig. 2-13 Unicursal graph.

It is clear that by adding an edge between the initial and final vertices of a
unicursal line we shall get an Euler line. Thus a connected graph is unicursal if
and only if it has exactly two vertices of odd degree. This observation can be
generalized as follows:

THEOREM 2-5

In a connected graph G with exactly 2k odd vertices, there exist k edge-
disjoint subgraphs such that they together contain all edges of G and that each is
a unicursal graph.

Proof: Let the odd vertices of the given graph G be named vy, v9, ... , Vis Wy,
Wp, ..-., W;, in any arbitrary order. Add k edges to G between the vertex pairs (v,,
W), (Vo, Wo), - + + » (Vs Wy) to form anew graph G’.

Since every vertex of G’ is of even degree, G' consists of an Euler line p. Now
if we remove from p the k edges we just added (no two of these edges are
incident on the same vertex), p will be split into k walks, each of which is a
unicursal line: The first removal will leave a single unicursal line; the second
removal will split that into two unicursal lines; and each successive removal will
split a unicursal line into two unicursal lines, until there are k of them. Thus the
theorem. =

We shall interrupt our study of Euler graphs to define some commonly used
graph-theoretic operations. One of these operations is required immediately in
the next section; others will be needed later.
