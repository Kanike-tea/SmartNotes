Chapter 2: Relational Algebra

2.1 Introduction

Relational algebra is the basic set of operations for the relational model. These operations enable a
user to specify basic retrieval requests as relational algebra expressions. The result of an operation is
a new relation, which may have been formed from one or more input relations.

The relational algebra is very important for several reasons

e First, it provides a formal foundation for relational model operations.

e Second, and perhaps more important, it is used as a basis for implementing and optimizing
queries in the query processing and optimization modules that are integral parts of
relational database management systems (RDBMSs)

e Third, some of its concepts are incorporated into the SQL standard query language for
RDBMSs

2.2 Unary Relational Operations: SELECT and PROJECT
2.2.1 The SELECT Operation
The SELECT operation denoted by o (sigma) is used to select a subset of the tuples from a relation
based on a selection condition. The selection condition acts as a filter that keeps only those tuples
that satisfy a qualifying condition. Alternatively, we can consider the SELECT operation to restrict
the tuples in a relation to only those tuples that satisfy the condition.
The SELECT operation can also be visualized as a horizontal partition of the relation into two sets
of tuples—those tuples that satisfy the condition and are selected, and those tuples that do not satisfy
the condition and are discarded.
In general, the select operation is denoted by
© <selection condition>(R)
where,
- the symbol is used to denote the select operator
- the selection condition is a Boolean (conditional) expression specified on the attributes of
relation R
- tuples that make the condition true are selected
+ appear in the result of the operation
- tuples that make the condition false are filtered out

+ discarded from the result of the operation
