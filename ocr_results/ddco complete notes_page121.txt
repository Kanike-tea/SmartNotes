During Write-operation

+ If the requested-word does not exists in the cache, then write-miss will occur.
1) If Write Through Protocol is used, the information is
written directlyinto main-memory.
2) If Write Back Protocol is used,

— then block containing the addressed word is first brought
into the cache&

— then the desired word in the cache is over-written
with the newinformation.

Mapping functions

There are 3 techniques to map main memory blocks into cache memory —
1. Direct mapped cache
2. Associative Mapping
3. Set-Associative Mapping

DIRECT MAPPING

¢ The simplest way to determine cache locations in which to store memory blocks

is the direct mapping technique as shown in the figure.

* Cache block number= (block-j of main memory)% 128; ° If there are 128

blocks in a cache, the
block-j of the main-memory maps onto block-jmodulo-128 of the cache . When the memory-blocks
0, 128, & 256 are loaded into cache, the block is stored in cache-block 0. Similarly, memory-
blocks 1, 129, 257 are stored in cache-block 1 .(eg:1mod 128=1,
129 mod 128=1)
¢ The contention may arise

1) Even when the cache is full.

2) But more than one memory-block is mapped onto a given cache-block position.
¢ The contention is resolved by allowing the new blocks to overwrite the currently resident-block.

Memory-address determines placement of block in the cache.
