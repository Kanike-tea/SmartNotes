Data distribution and replication among distributed databases.

as sharding in the newer big data and cloud computing systems. Vertical
fragmentation distributes a relation into subrelations where each subrelation
is defined by a subset of the columns of the original relation. Fragmentation
transparency makes the user unaware of the existence of fragments.

= Other transparencies include design transparency and execution
transparency—which refer, respectively, to freedom from knowing how the
distributed database is designed and where a transaction executes.

23.1.3 Availability and Reliability

Reliability and availability are two of the most common potential advantages cited
for distributed databases. Reliability is broadly defined as the probability that a
system is running (not down) at a certain time point, whereas availability is the
probability that the system is continuously available during a time interval. We can
directly relate reliability and availability of the database to the faults, errors, and
failures associated with it. A failure can be described as a deviation of a system’s
behavior from that which is specified in order to ensure correct execution of opera-
tions. Errors constitute that subset of system states that causes the failure. Fault is
the cause of an error.

To construct a system that is reliable, we can adopt several approaches. One com-
mon approach stresses fault tolerance; it recognizes that faults will occur, and it
designs mechanisms that can detect and remove faults before they can result in a
