We now proceed to prove the sufficient condition for a complex valued function
w = f(z) to represent a conformal transformation.

Theorem : If w = f(z) is an analytic function of z in a region: uf the z— ptrrie tyes
w = f(z) is conformal at all points of the region where f'(z) #0.

Proof:Let A(z), B(z+ 5z) be the two neighbouring points onthecurve C of the
z—plane and A’(w), B’(w+8w) be the corresponding points on the curve C’
of the w-plane.

We can write amp oe = amp 5w-amp 8z

6 :
ie, amp - = 6’-6

"Since f’ (z ) #.0 by hypothesis we can write,
f(z) =Ré% where R # 0. Taking aniplitudes,
Lt amp 2% = 0 where o isa definite angle.

ie., Lt (0’-0) = % = ampf’(z) s0(l)

Let two curves Cy, Cy intersect at a point P(zy) of the z— plane and the

Let.Q, R; Q’, R’ be the two neighbouring points of P and P’ respectively.
