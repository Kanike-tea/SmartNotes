Flapping-wing drones: Researchers have developed drones that use flapping wings to
fly, mimicking the way birds and insects fly. These drones can be used for various
applications, such as monitoring crops and wildlife, inspecting buildings and
infrastructure, and search and rescue operations.

Soaring algorithms: Soaring refers to the flight technique used by birds and certain
aircraft to stay aloft and travel long distances with minimal energy expenditure. It
involves utilizing rising air currents, such as thermals, ridge lift, wind shear, or
atmospheric waves, to gain altitude and maintain flight. Birds use thermals, or columns
of rising warm air, to gain altitude and soar. Researchers have developed algorithms
inspired by bird flight to help gliders and other aircraft use thermals more efficiently,
leading to longer and more sustainable flights.

Landing gear: The legs and feet of birds have inspired the design of landing gear for
aircraft, with shock-absorbing and retractable structures that help absorb impact upon
landing.

The future of transportation through the air

The future of transportation through the air holds exciting possibilities with the

emergence of new technologies and concepts. Here are some potential modes of air
transportation that could shape the future:

Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) Aircraft: These are electric-powered
aircraft that can take off and land vertically, similar to helicopters. They are being
designed for urban air mobility and short-distance transportation, offering a more
efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional helicopters.

Autonomous Flying Vehicles: Autonomous drones and flying taxis are being developed
for various applications, including transportation of people and goods. These vehicles
would operate without a pilot and rely on advanced sensors, artificial intelligence, and
automation to navigate safely.

High-Speed Air Travel: Supersonic and hypersonic aircraft are being explored to
revolutionize long-distance travel. These aircraft would travel at extremely high speeds,
significantly reducing travel times and opening up new possibilities for global
connectivity.

Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs): PAVs are compact flying vehicles designed for
individual use. They could potentially serve as a convenient mode of transportation for
short- distance travel within cities, similar to personal cars but in the air.
