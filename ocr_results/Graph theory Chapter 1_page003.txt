p vertex of a digraph which is neither an initial vertex nor a terminal vertex of ry directed
ge is called an isolated vertex of the digraph. A non-isolated vanes happens to = initial
vertex or a terminal vertex for a (some) directed edge. A omisolated vertex whieh is Rot a
terminal vertex for any directed edge is called a source and a non-isolated vertex which is not
an initial vertex for any directed edge is called a sink.

In the digraph shown in Figure 1.6, the vertex vq is an isolated vertex, the vertices vy, and

v3 are sources and the vertex v2 is a sink. The vertices vs and ve do not belong to any of these
categories.

In-degree and Out-degree

If Vis a vertex of a digraph D, the number of edges for which v is the initial vertex is called
the out-going degree or the out-degree of v and the number of edges for which v is the terminal
vertex is called the incoming degree or the in

av) or od{v) and the in-degree of v is denoted by d(v) or id(yv).
