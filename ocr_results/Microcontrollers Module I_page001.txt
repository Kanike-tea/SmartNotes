Microcontrollers-BCS402

1. Introduction

The ARM processor core is a key component of many successful 32-bit embedded systems. It

is widely used in mobile phones, handheld organizers, and portable consumer devices.

The first ARM1 prototype is developed in 1985. The ARM core is not a single core, but a

whole family of designs sharing similar design principles and a common instruction set.

One of the most successful ARM core is the ARM7TDML. It provides up to 120 Dhrystone
MIPS1 and is known for its high code density and low power consumption, making it ideal

for mobile embedded devices.

2. The RISC Design Philosophy

The ARM core uses RISC architecture.

It has simple and powerful instructions that execute within a single cycle at a high clock
speed. The RISC philosophy reduces the complexity of instructions performed by the
hardware so that it provides greater flexibility and intelligence in software rather than
hardware. In contrast, the traditional complex instruction set computer (CISC) relies more on
the hardware for instruction functionality, and consequently the CISC instructions are more

complicated. Figure 2.1 illustrates these major differences.

complexity.
The RISC philosophy is implemented with four major design rules:

Instructions—RISC processors have a reduced number of instruction classes. These classes
provide simple operations that can each execute in a single cycle. To perform complex

operations such as divide operation, many simple instructions are combined. Each instruction
