Selected Bibliography

textbook in IR is Modern Information Retrieval by Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier
Ribeiro-Neto (1999), which provides detailed coverage of various aspects of IR
technology. Gerald Salton’s (1968) and van Rijsbergen’s (1979) classic books on
information retrieval provide excellent descriptions of the foundational research
done in the IR field until the late 1960s. Salton also introduced the vector space
model as a model of IR. Manning and Schutze (1999) provide a good summary of
natural language technologies and text preprocessing. “Interactive Information
Retrieval in Digital Environments” by Xie (2008) provides a good human-centered
approach to information retrieval. The book Managing Gigabytes by Witten, Mof-
fat, and Bell (1999) provides detailed discussions for indexing techniques. The
TREC book by Voorhees and Harman (2005) provides a description of test collec-
tion and evaluation procedures in the context of TREC competitions.

Broder (2002) classifies Web queries into three distinct classes—navigational,
informational, and transactional—and presents a detailed taxonomy of Web search.
Covi and Kling (1996) give a broad definition of digital libraries and discuss organi-
zational dimensions of effective digital library use. Luhn (1957) did seminal work in
IR at IBM in the 1950s on autoindexing and business intelligence. The SMART
system (Salton et al. (1993)), developed at Cornell, was one of the earliest advanced
IR systems that used fully automatic term indexing, hierarchical clustering, and
document ranking by degree of similarity to the query. The SMART system repre-
sented documents and queries as weighted term vectors according to the vector
space model.

Porter (1980) is credited with the weak and strong stemming algorithms that have
become standards. Robertson (1997) developed a sophisticated weighting scheme
in the City University of London Okapi system that became very popular in TREC
competitions. Lenat (1995) started the Cyc project in the 1980s for incorporating
formal logic and knowledge bases in information processing systems. Efforts
toward creating the WordNet thesaurus continued in the 1990s and are still ongo-
ing. WordNet concepts and principles are described in the book by Fellbaum
(1998). Rocchio (1971) describes the relevance feedback algorithm, which is
described in Salton’s (1971) book on The SMART Retrieval System—Experiments in
Automatic Document Processing.

Abiteboul, Buneman, and Suciu (1999) provide an extensive discussion of data on
the Web in their book that emphasizes semistructured data. Atzeni and Mendelzon
(2000) wrote an editorial in the VLDB journal on databases and the Web. Atzeni et
al. (2002) propose models and transformations for Web-based data. Abiteboul et al.
(1997) propose the Lord query language for managing semistructured data.

Chakrabarti (2002) is an excellent book on knowledge discovery from the Web. The
book by Liu (2006) consists of several parts, each providing a comprehensive over-
view of the concepts involved with Web data analysis and its applications. Excellent
survey articles on Web analysis include Kosala and Blockeel (2000) and Liu et al.
(2004). Etzioni (1996) provides a good starting point for understanding Web min-
ing and describes the tasks and issues related to data mining on the World Wide
Web. An excellent overview of the research issues, techniques, and development
