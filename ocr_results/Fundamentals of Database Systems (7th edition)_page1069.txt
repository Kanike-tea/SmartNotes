WordNet”? is a manually constructed thesaurus that groups words into strict syn-
onym sets called synsets. These synsets are divided into noun, verb, adjective, and
adverb categories. Within each category, these synsets are linked together by appro-
priate relationships such as class/subclass or “is-a” relationships for nouns.

WordNet is based on the idea of using a controlled vocabulary for indexing, thereby
eliminating redundancies. It is also useful in providing assistance to users with
locating terms for proper query formulation.

27.4.4 Other Preprocessing Steps: Digits, Hyphens,
Punctuation Marks, Cases

Digits, dates, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, URLs, and other standard types of
text may or may not be removed during preprocessing. Web search engines, how-
ever, index them in order to use this type of information in the document metadata
to improve precision and recall (see Section 27.6 for detailed definitions of precision
and recall).
