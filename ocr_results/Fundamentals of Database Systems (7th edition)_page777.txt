central processing unit (CPU) can only execute at most one process at a time. How-
ever, multiprogramming operating systems execute some commands from one pro-
cess, then suspend that process and execute some commands from the next process,
and so on. A process is resumed at the point where it was suspended whenever it gets
its turn to use the CPU again. Hence, concurrent execution of processes is actually
interleaved, as illustrated in Figure 20.1, which shows two processes, A and B, execut-
ing concurrently in an interleaved fashion. Interleaving keeps the CPU busy when a
process requires an input or output (I/O) operation, such as reading a block from disk.
The CPU is switched to execute another process rather than remaining idle during I/O
time. Interleaving also prevents a long process from delaying other processes.

If the computer system has multiple hardware processors (CPUs), parallel processing
of multiple processes is possible, as illustrated by processes C and D in Figure 20.1.
Most of the theory concerning concurrency control in databases is developed in terms
of interleaved concurrency, so for the remainder of this chapter we assume this model.
In a multiuser DBMS, the stored data items are the primary resources that may be
accessed concurrently by interactive users or application programs, which are con-
stantly retrieving information from and modifying the database.

20.1.2 Transactions, Database Items, Read
and Write Operations, and DBMS Buffers

A transaction is an executing program that forms a logical unit of database pro-
cessing. A transaction includes one or more database access operations—these can
include insertion, deletion, modification (update), or retrieval operations. The
database operations that form a transaction can either be embedded within an
application program or they can be specified interactively via a high-level query
language such as SQL. One way of specifying the transaction boundaries is by
specifying explicit begin transaction and end transaction statements in an appli-
cation program; in this case, all database access operations between the two are
considered as forming one transaction. A single application program may contain
more than one transaction if it contains several transaction boundaries. If the
database operations in a transaction do not update the database but only retrieve
