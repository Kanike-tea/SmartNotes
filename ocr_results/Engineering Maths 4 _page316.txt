Continuous Probability Distribution - Definition

Binomial and Poisson distributions discussed earlier are discrete probability

distributions where in the variate can only take integral values.

We have already defined that a random variable which takes noncountable infinite

number of values is called a continuous random variable.

If a variate can take any value in an interval, it will give rise to continuous distribution.
. When a random variable is identified as continuous, we need to consider various

questions connected with the probability of the random variable assuming different

values. In this context we need a continuous probability function which is defined as
follows. oP
