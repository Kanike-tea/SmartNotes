The function can be invoked as follows to allocate memory
int ** twodarray
twodarray= maketwodarray(5,10);

Arrays
Linear Arrays: A Linear Array is a list of finite number (n) of homogenous data elements.

a. The elements of the array are referenced by an index set consisting of n consecutive
numbers(0. ..(n-1)).

b. The elements of the array are stored in successive memory locations

c. The number n of elements is called the length or size of the array. Length of the array can be
obtained from the index set using the formula

Length = Upper bound — Lowe bound +1

d. The elements of an array may be denoted by a[0],a[2]............a{n-1]. The number k in a[k] is
called a subscript or index and a[k] is called the subscripted value.

e. An array is usually implemented as a consecutive set of memory locations

Declaration: Linear arrays are declared by adding a bracket to the name of a variable. The size of
the array is mentioned within the brackets.

Eg :- int list[5]; // Declares an array containing five integer elements.

In C all arrays start at index 0. Therefore, list[{0], list[{1], list{2], list[3], and list{4] are the names of
the five array elements ,each of which contains an integer value.

Representation of Linear Arrays in memory

e¢ When the compiler encounters an array declaration such as int list[5], to create list, it allocates
five consecutive memory locations. Each memory location is large enough to hold a single
integer.

e The address of the first element list[0], is called the base address

base address=address(list[0])
e Using the base address the address of any element of list can be calculated using the formula
address(list[k])= base addres + w.k
// where w is the size of each element in the array list

Example: int list[5]

e The elements of the array is list[0] list[4]
e Ifthe size of an integer on the machine is denoted by sizeof(int), then the memory
Address(list [k])= base address+ sizeof (int).k.

Variable Memory Address canlculatio

Let a the base address , the address of list[0]

Let w=sizeof(int)
address(list{1] )= a + w*1
address(list[2]) = a + w*2
address(list[3]) = a + w*3
address(list[4]) = a + w*4
