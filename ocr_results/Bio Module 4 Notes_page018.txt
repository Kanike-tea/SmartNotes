4.3.1 GPS Technology

GPS (Global Positioning System) is a technology that uses a network of satellites to
provide location and time information to users. The technology works by measuring the time it
takes for signals to travel from satellites to a receiver on the ground or in a vehicle, and using this
information to calculate the user's position.

Here are some key components of GPS technology:

e Satellites: The GPS satellite network consists of 24-32 satellites orbiting the Earth. These
satellites continuously broadcast signals containing information about their location, time,
and status.

e Receivers: GPS receivers, which are typically integrated into devices such as snfalphones,
navigation systems, and aircraft, receive signals from GPS satellites and use the information
to calculate the user's position.

e¢ Control segment: The control segment consists of ground-based monitoring stations that
track the GPS satellites, check the accuracy of their signals, and make adjustments as
needed.

e User segment: The user segment consists of the GPS receivers used by individuals and
organizations to obtain location and time information.

GPS technology has a wide range of applications, including navigation, mapping,
surveying, search and rescue, and military operations. The accuracy and reliability of GPS have
improved over time, and the technology continues to evolve with new developments in satellite
and receiver technology, as well as the integration of GPS with other technologies such as
augmented reality and artificial intelligence.
