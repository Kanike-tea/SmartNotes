30.6 Introduction to Flow Control

only queries that involve statistical aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, MIN,
MAX, AVERAGE, and STANDARD DEVIATION. Such queries are sometimes called
statistical queries.

It is the responsibility of a database management system to ensure the confidentiality
of information about individuals while still providing useful statistical summaries of
data about those individuals to users. Provision of privacy protection of users in a
statistical database is paramount; its violation is illustrated in the following example.

In some cases it is possible to infer the values of individual tuples from a sequence
of statistical queries. This is particularly true when the conditions result in a popu-
lation consisting of a small number of tuples. As an illustration, consider the fol-
lowing statistical queries:

Q1: SELECT COUNT (*)FROM PERSON
WHERE <condition>;

Q2: SELECT AVG (Income) FROM PERSON
WHERE <condition>;

Now suppose that we are interested in finding the Salary of Jane Smith, and we
know that she has a Ph.D. degree and that she lives in the city of Bellaire, Texas. We
issue the statistical query Q1 with the following condition:

(Last_degree=Ph.D? AND Sex="F’ AND City=“Bellaire’ AND State=“Texas’)

If we get a result of 1 for this query, we can issue Q2 with the same condition and
find the Salary of Jane Smith. Even if the result of Q1 on the preceding condition is
not 1 but is a small number—say 2 or 3—we can issue statistical queries using the
functions MAX, MIN, and AVERAGE to identify the possible range of values for the
Salary of Jane Smith.

The possibility of inferring individual information from statistical queries is reduced if
no statistical queries are permitted whenever the number of tuples in the population
specified by the selection condition falls below some threshold. Another technique for
prohibiting retrieval of individual information is to prohibit sequences of queries that
refer repeatedly to the same population of tuples. It is also possible to introduce slight
inaccuracies or noise into the results of statistical queries deliberately, to make it diffi-
cult to deduce individual information from the results. Another technique is partition-
ing of the database. Partitioning implies that records are stored in groups of some
minimum size; queries can refer to any complete group or set of groups, but never to
subsets of records within a group. The interested reader is referred to the bibliography
at the end of this chapter for a discussion of these techniques.

30.6 Introduction to Flow Control

Flow control regulates the distribution or flow of information among accessible
objects. A flow between object X and object Y occurs when a program reads values
from X and writes values into Y. Flow controls check that information contained in
some objects does not flow explicitly or implicitly into less protected objects. Thus, a
