How Does It Work?

+ Waste material is examined & certain bacteria

are isolated based on their efficacy atdigesting

and converting the waste.
+ Indigenous or local bacteria is to beused!
+ The bacteria then go through several steps of
cultures and process for performance testing.
The suitable bacteria are placed back inthe
waste environment.
+ They grow & thrive &in the process digest &
convert the waste into Carbon dioxide & water.
The right temperature, nutrients, and food also
must be present.

Microbe takes in oil, oxygen, and nutrients and releases
gases and water.

Bio-mining is a method of extracting minerals and metals from their parent ores using

naturally occurring biological processes

Microorganisms are used to leach out the minerals, rather than the traditional methods of
extreme heat or toxic chemicals, which have a deleterious effect on the environment.

This technology is also environmentally friendly as it generates minimal amount of pollutants

Some examples of application of bio-mining/ bio-leachii
technology & its advantage over conventional pyro-metallurgical &
hydro-metallurgical technology
