Digital Design &Computer Organization(BCS302) MODULE -4

+ This number of blocks is small compared to the total number of blocks available
in main-memory.

+ Correspondence b/w main-memory-block & cache-memory-block is specified by
mapping-function.

- If the cache memory is full, one of the block should be removed to create space
forthe new block, this is decided by cache control hardware.

* The collection of rule for selecting the block to be removed is called the
Replacement Algorithm.

+ The cache control-circuit determines whether the requested-word currently exists in
the cache.

+ If data is available, for read-operation, the data is read from cache.
+ The write-operation (writing to memory) is done in 2 ways:
1) Write-through protocol &
2) Write-back protocol.
Write-Through Protocol

Here the cache-location and the main-memory-locations are updated
simultaneously.

Write-Back Protocol

> This technique is to

— update only the cache-location &

— mark the cache-location with a flag bit called Dirty/Modified Bit.

>» The word in memory will be updated later, when the marked-block is

removed from cache.

During Read-operation

+ If the requested-word currently does not exists in the cache, then read-miss will
occur.

* To overcome the read miss, Load-through/Early restart protocol is used.

Load-Through Protocol

> The block of words that contains the requested-word is copied from the

memory into cache.

» After entire block is loaded into cache, the requested-word is forwarded
to processor.
