1068 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

efforts associated with Web content and usage analysis is presented by Cooley et al.
(1997). Cooley (2003) focuses on mining Web usage patterns through the use of
Web structure. Spiliopoulou (2000) describes Web usage analysis in detail. Web
mining based on page structure is described in Madria et al. (1999) and Chakraborti
et al. (1999). Algorithms to compute the rank of a Web page are given by Page et al.
(1999), who describe the famous PageRank algorithm, and Kleinberg (1998), who
presents the HITS algorithm.

Harth, Hose, and Schenkel (2014) present techniques for querying and managing
linked data on the Web and show the potential of these techniques for research and
commercial applications. Question answering technology is described in some
detail by Ferrucci et al. (2010), who developed the IBM Watson system. Bikel and
Zitouni (2012) is a comprehensive guide for developing robust and accurate multi-
lingual NLP (natural language processing) systems. Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003)
provide an overview on topic modeling and latent Dirichlet allocation. For an in-
depth, hands-on guide to Lucene and Solr technologies, refer to the upcoming book
by Moczar (2015).
