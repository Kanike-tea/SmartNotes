we get fewer scans to do. On the other hand, a condition outside unnecessarily
increases the tuples to scan.
5.Theta Joins are commutative.

Explanation: Theta Joins are commutative, and the query processing time depends to some
extent which table is used as the outer loop and which one is used as the inner loop during the
join process (based on the indexing structures and blocks).
6.Join operations are associative.
«= Natural Join
Explanation: Joins are all commutative as well as associative, so one must join those
two tables first which yield less number of entries, and then apply the other join.
* Theta Join

Explanation: Theta Joins are associative in the above manner, where involves
attributes from only E2 and E3.

7.Selection operation can be distributed.
* Equivalence 1
Explanation: Applying a selection after doing the Theta Join causes all the tuples
returned by the Theta Join to be monitored after the join. If this selection contains
attributes from only E1, it is better to apply this selection to El (hence resulting in a
fewer number of tuples) and then join it with E2.
* Equivalence 2

Explanation: This can be extended to two selection conditions, and , Where

Thetal contains the attributes of only El and contains attributes of only E2. Hence,
we can individually apply the selection criteria before joining, to drastically reduce the
number of tuples joined.

8.Projection distributes over the Theta Join.
* Equivalence 1
Explanation: The idea discussed for selection can be used for projection as well. Here,
if L1 is a projection that involves columns of only El, and L2 another projection that
involves the columns of only E2, then it is better to individually apply the projections on
both the tables before joining. This leaves us with a fewer number of columns on either
side, hence contributing to an easier join.
* Equivalence 2
Explanation: Here, when applying projections L1 and L2 on the join, where LI
contains columns of only El and L2 contains columns of only E2, we can introduce
another column E3 (which is common between both the tables). Then, we can apply
projections L1 and L2 on El and E2 respectively, along with the added column L3. L3
enables us to do the join.

9.Union and Intersection are commutative.

Explanation: Union and intersection are both distributive; we can enclose any tables in

parantheses according to requirement and ease of access.

10. Union and Intersection are associative.

Explanation: Union and intersection are both distributive; we can enclose any tables in

parantheses according to requirement and ease of access.

11. Selection operation distributes over the union, intersection, and difference

operations.

Explanation: In set difference, we know that only those tuples are shown which belong to
