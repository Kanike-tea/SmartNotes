that Al grants SELECT to A2 on the EMPLOYEE relation with horizontal propaga-
tion equal to 1 and vertical propagation equal to 2. A2 can then grant SELECT to at
most one account because the horizontal propagation limitation is set to 1. Addi-
tionally, A2 cannot grant the privilege to another account except with vertical prop-
agation set to 0 (no GRANT OPTION) or 1; this is because A2 must reduce the vertical
propagation by at least 1 when passing the privilege to others. In addition, the hori-
zontal propagation must be less than or equal to the originally granted horizontal
propagation. For example, if account A grants a privilege to account B with the
horizontal propagation set to an integer number j > 0, this means that B can grant
the privilege to other accounts only with a horizontal propagation less than or equal
to j. As this example shows, horizontal and vertical propagation techniques are
designed to limit the depth and breadth of propagation of privileges.

30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based
Access Control for Multilevel Security

The discretionary access control technique of granting and revoking privileges on
relations has traditionally been the main security mechanism for relational data-
base systems. This is an all-or-nothing method: A user either has or does not have a
certain privilege. In many applications, an additional security policy is needed that
classifies data and users based on security classes. This approach, known as
mandatory access control (MAC), would typically be combined with the discre-
tionary access control mechanisms described in Section 30.2. It is important to note
that most mainstream RDBMSs currently provide mechanisms only for discretionary
access control. However, the need for multilevel security exists in government, mil-
itary, and intelligence applications, as well as in many industrial and corporate
applications. Because of the overriding concerns for privacy, in many systems the
levels are determined by who has what access to what private information (also
called personally identifiable information). Some DBMS vendors—for example,
Oracle—have released special versions of their RDBMSs that incorporate manda-
tory access control for government use.

Typical security classes are top secret (TS), secret (S), confidential (C), and unclas-
sified (U), where TS is the highest level and U the lowest. Other more complex
security classification schemes exist, in which the security classes are organized in
a lattice. For simplicity, we will use the system with four security classification lev-
els, where TS = $ > C 2 U, to illustrate our discussion. The commonly used model
for multilevel security, known as the Bell-LaPadula model, classifies each subject
(user, account, program) and object (relation, tuple, column, view, operation) into
one of the security classifications TS, $, C, or U. We will refer to the clearance
(classification) of a subject S as class($) and to the classification of an object O as
class(O). Two restrictions are enforced on data access based on the subject/object
classifications:
