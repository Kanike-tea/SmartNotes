* Obstetrics and gynecology: Ultrasonography is commonly used to monitor the growth and development
of a fetus during pregnancy, as well as to evaluate the reproductive organs and female pelvic organs for
conditions such as ovarian cysts, fibroids, and endometrial cancer.

+ Abdominal imaging: Ultrasonography is used to image the organs of the abdomen, such as the liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys, to diagnose conditions such as liver disease, gallstones,
pancreatitis, and kidney stones.

+ Musculoskeletal imaging: Ultrasonography is used to image the muscles, tendons, and ligaments to
diagnose conditions such as muscle strains, tendonitis, and ligament sprains.

+ Vascular imaging: Ultrasonography is used to image blood vessels, such as the arteries and veins, to
diagnose conditions such as blood clots, blockages, and aneurysms.

+ Eye and neck imaging: Ultrasonography is used to image the eyes and neck to diagnose conditions such
as cataracts, glaucoma, and thyroid nodules.

+ Emergency medicine: Ultrasonography is often used in emergency medicine to quickly and accurately
diagnose conditions such as appendicitis, pneumothorax, and fluid buildup in the abdomen or chest.
Working Principle of Ultrasonography

The working principle of ultrasonography is based on the reflection of high-frequency sound waves.

* Transducer: An ultrasonography machine consists of a transducer that is used to emit and receive high-
frequency sound waves. The transducer is placed in direct contact with the skin or inserted into the body
through a gel.

+ Emission of sound waves: The transducer emits high-frequency sound waves (usually in the range of 2
to 18 MHz) into the body. These sound waves travel through the body and encounter different tissues and
organs, which have different acoustic properties.

* Reflection of sound waves: The sound waves encounter boundaries between different tissues and organs
and bounce back, creating echoes. The strength of the echoes depends on the acoustic properties of the
tissues and organs, such as density and stiffness.

* Reception of echoes: The transducer in the ultrasonography machine receives the echoes and sends the

information to a computer, which processes the data to create images.

+ Image formation: The computer uses the information from the echoes to create images of the internal
organs and tissues of the body. The images are displayed on a screen, allowing the operator to see the

structure and movement of the internal organs and tissues.

Differentiate between Biological & technological echolocation.

Ans. Echolocation is a biological or technological process that involves emitting sound waves and listening
to the echoes that bounce back off of objects in the environment to determine their location, distance, and
shape.

A comparison of biological echolocation and technological echolocation is given below:
