176 3. Trees

Find all the spanning trees of the graph shown below.

Figure 3.25

> In the given graph, there are four vertices. Its spanning tree must include all these four
vertices and three of the edges. Each such tree is got by deleting two edges ‘from the’ graph.
There are eight such trees; these are shown in Figures 3.26(a)-(h).
