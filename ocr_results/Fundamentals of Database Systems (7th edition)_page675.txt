17.7 Physical Database Design in Relational Databases

17.7.2 Physical Database Design Decisions

Most relational systems represent each base relation as a physical database file. The
access path options include specifying the type of primary file organization for each
relation and the attributes that are candidates for defining individual or composite
indexes. At most, one of the indexes on each file may be a primary or a clustering
index. Any number of additional secondary indexes can be created.

Design Decisions about Indexing. The attributes whose values are required
in equality or range conditions (selection operation) are those that are keys or
that participate in join conditions (join operation) requiring access paths, such
as indexes.

The performance of queries largely depends upon what indexes or hashing schemes
exist to expedite the processing of selections and joins. On the other hand, during
insert, delete, or update operations, the existence of indexes adds to the overhead.
This overhead must be justified in terms of the gain in efficiency by expediting que-
ries and transactions.

The physical design decisions for indexing fall into the following categories:

1. Whether to index an attribute. The general rules for creating an index on
an attribute are that the attribute must either be a key (unique), or there
must be some query that uses that attribute either in a selection condition
(equality or range of values) or in a join condition. One reason for creating
multiple indexes is that some operations can be processed by just scanning
the indexes, without having to access the actual data file.

2. What attribute or attributes to index on. An index can be constructed on a
single attribute, or on more than one attribute if it is a composite index. If
multiple attributes from one relation are involved together in several que-
ries, (for example, (Garment_style_#, Color) in a garment inventory database),
a multiattribute (composite) index is warranted. The ordering of attributes
within a multiattribute index must correspond to the queries. For instance,
the above index assumes that queries would be based on an ordering of col-
ors within a Garment_style_# rather than vice versa.

3. Whether to set up a clustered index. At most, one index per table can be a
primary or clustering index, because this implies that the file be physically
ordered on that attribute. In most RDBMSs, this is specified by the keyword
CLUSTER. (If the attribute is a key, a primary index is created, whereas a
clustering index is created if the attribute is not a key.) If a table requires sev-
eral indexes, the decision about which one should be the primary or cluster-
ing index depends upon whether keeping the table ordered on that attribute
is needed. Range queries benefit a great deal from clustering. If several attri-
butes require range queries, relative benefits must be evaluated before decid-
ing which attribute to cluster on. If a query is to be answered by doing an
index search only (without retrieving data records), the corresponding index
should not be clustered, since the main benefit of clustering is achieved
