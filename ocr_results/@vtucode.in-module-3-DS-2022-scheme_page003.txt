Figure (2): 4 x 4 sparse matrix a
Figure (3) shows the linked representation of this matrix. Although we have not

shownthe value of the tag fields, we can easily determine these values from the node

structure.

For each nonzero term of a, have one entry node that is in exactly one row list and one

column list. The header nodes are marked HO-H3. As the figure shows, we use the

rightfield of the header node list header.
