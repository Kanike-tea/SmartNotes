3. The players are assigned a color of black or white at the start of the game.

4. Each player starts with the following pieces (traditionally called
chessmen):

king

. queen

. 2 rooks

. 2 bishops

. 2 knights

8 pawns

5. Every piece has its own initial position.

6. Every piece has its own set of legal moves based on the state of the game.
You do not need to worry about which moves are or are not legal except
for the following issues:

a. A piece may move to an empty square or capture an opposing piece.

b. Ifa piece is captured, it is removed from the board.

c. Ifa pawn moves to the last row, it is “promoted” by converting it to
another piece (queen, rook, bishop, or knight).

Note: Some of these functions may be spread over multiple classes.
Draw an EER diagram for a game of chess as described in Exercise 4. 24. Focus

on persistent storage aspects of the system. For example, the system would
need to retrieve all the moves of every game played in sequential order.

Which of the following EER diagrams is/are incorrect and why? State clearly
any assumptions you make.
