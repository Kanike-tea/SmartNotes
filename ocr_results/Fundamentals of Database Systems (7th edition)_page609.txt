directory is also split into two locations, both of which have the same pointer value

as did the original location.

The main advantage of extendible hashing that makes it attractive is that the perfor-
mance of the file does not degrade as the file grows, as opposed to static external
hashing, where collisions increase and the corresponding chaining effectively
increases the average number of accesses per key. Additionally, no space is allocated
in extendible hashing for future growth, but additional buckets can be allocated
