+ Let SPECi = Rating for program ,,i' in the suite.

Overall SPEC rating for the computer is given by
1

SPEC rating = (itsrec)

where n = no. of programs in the suite.

Problem 1:
List the steps needed to execute the machine instruction:
Load R2, LOC
in terms of transfers between the components of processor and some simple control commands.
Assume that the address of the memory-location containing this instruction is initially in register PC.
Solution:
1. Transfer the contents of register PC to register MAR.
2. Issue a Read command to memory.
And, then wait until it has transferred the requested word into register MDR.
3. Transfer the instruction from MDR into IR and decode it.
4. Transfer the address LOCA from IR to MAR.
5. Issue a Read command and wait until MDR is loaded.
6. Transfer contents of MDR to the ALU.
7. Transfer contents of RO to the ALU.
8. Perform addition of the two operands in the ALU and transfer result into RO.
9. Transfer contents of PC to ALU.
10. Add | to operand in ALU and transfer incremented address to PC.

Problem 2:
A program contains 1000 instructions. Out of that 25% instructions requires 4 clock cycles40%
instructions requires 5 clock cycles and remaining require 3 clock cycles for execution. Find the total
time required to execute the program running in a 1 GHz machine.
Solution:
N= 1000
25% of N= 250 instructions require 4 clock cycles.
40% of N =400 instructions require 5 clock
cycles. 35% of N=350 instructions require 3
clock cycles.

T = (N*S)/R= (250*4+400*5+350*3)/1X109 =(1000+2000+1050)/1*109= 4.05 us.

Problem 3:
For the following processor, obtain the performance.
Clock rate = 800 MHz
No. of instructions executed = 1000
Average no of steps needed / machine instruction = 20
Solution:

x§
> (1000*20)/800 * 10°=25 micro sec or 25*10° sec

MEMORY-LOCATIONS & ADDRESSES
* Memory consists of many millions of storage cells (flip-flops).
* Each cell can store a bit of information i.e. 0 or 1 (Figure 2.1).
+ Each group of n bits is referred to as a word of information, and n is called the word length.
