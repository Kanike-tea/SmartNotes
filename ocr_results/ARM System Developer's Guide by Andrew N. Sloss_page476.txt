13. 1 PROTECTED REGIONS

Table 13.1

There are currently four ARM cores that contain an MPU; the ARM740T, ARM940T,
ARM946E-S, and the ARM1026EJ-S. The ARM740T, ARM946E-S, and ARM1026EJ-S each
contain 8 protection regions; the ARM940T contains 16 (see Table 13.1).

The ARM740T, ARM946E-S, and ARM1026EJ-S have unified instruction and data
regions—the data region and instruction region are defined using the same register that sets
the size and starting address. The memory access permission and cache policies are config-
ured independently for instruction and data access in the ARM946E-S and ARM1026EJ-S
cores; in the ARM740T the same access permission and cache policies are assigned to
both instruction and data memory. Regions are independent of whether the core has a
Von Neumann or Harvard architecture. Each region is referenced by an identifying number
between zero and seven.

Because the ARM940T has separate regions to control instruction and data memory,
the core can maintain different region sizes and starting addresses for instruction and data
regions. The separation of instruction and data regions results in eight additional regions
in this cached core. Although the identifying region numbers in an ARM940T still range
from zero to seven, each region number has a pair of regions, one data region and one
instruction region.

‘There are several rules that govern regions:

1. Regions can overlap other regions.

2. Regions are assigned a priority number that is independent of the privilege assigned to
the region.

3. When regions overlap, the attributes of the region with the highest priority number take
precedence over the other regions. The priority only applies over the addresses within
the areas that overlap.

4. A region’s starting address must be a multiple of its size.

w

. A region’s size can be any power of two between 4 KB and 4 GB—in other words, any
of the following values: 4 KB, 8 KB, 16 KB, 32 KB, 64 KB,..., 2 GB, 4 GB.
