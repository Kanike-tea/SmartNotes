But f(z) = utiv is analytic and hence we have Cauchy- -Riemann equations :

Hence the curves intersect orthogonally at every point of intersection.

Note: Converse of this theorem is not true and it is illustrated by the following exanipple,

Let unt and vaxr4 2

We shall show that the curves u = cy wa vee a and cy being constants)

intersect orthogonally but u and uv does: not satisfy Cauchy -Riemann equations.

Differentiating these w.r.t. x treating y asa function of xwe obtain
