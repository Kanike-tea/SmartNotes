DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

+ Disadvantage: This representation wastes a lot of space. For instance, if
a.degree<<MAX_DEGREE and polynomial is sparse, then we will not need most of the
positions in a.coef[MAX_DEGREE] (sparse means number of terms with non-zero
coefficient is small relative to degree of the polynomial).

POLYNOMIAL REPRESENTATION: SECOND METHOD

© A(x)=2x20+1 and B(x)=x*+10x?+3x?+1 can be represented as shown below.

Array representation’of two polynomials

+ startA & startB give the index of first term of A and B respectively . finishA & finishB give
the index of the last term of A & B respectively avail gives the index of next free location in
the array.

+ Any polynomial A that has ‘n’ non-zero terms has startA & finishA such that
finishA=startA+n-1

+ Advantage: This representation solves the problem of many 0 terms since A(x)-2x1000+1
uses only 6 units of storage (one for startA, one for finishA, 2 for the coefficients and 2 for
the exponents)

+ Disadvantage: However, when all the terms are non-zero, the current representation requires

about twice as much space as the first one.
