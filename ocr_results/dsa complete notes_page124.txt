Drawbacks of Linear Probing

' Identifiers tend to cluster together
' Adjacent cluster tend to coalesce
' Increase the search time

Example showing the drawback

Insert acos, atoi,char,define,exp,ceil,cos, float, atol, floor , ctime into a 26 bucket hash table

bucket x Bucket searched

0 acos 1
1 atoi 2
2 char 1
3 define 1
4 exp 1
5 ceil 4
6 cos 5
7 float 3
8 atol 9
9 floor 5
10 ctime 9
25

We see the number of searches increasing and the keys clustering together

Quadratic Probing
= Quadratic probing uses a quadratic function of i as the increment
= Suppose a record R with key k has the hash addres H(k)=h then instead of searching the
locations with h,h+1, h+2,........... we linearly search locations with h,h+1,h+4,h+9,......... h+i?
= Ifthe number m of locations in the table T is a prime number, then the above sequence will
access half of the locations T

Double hashing
Here a second hash function H’ is used for resolving a collision, as follows.
Suppose a record R with key k has the hash address H(k)=h and h’(k)=h’¥ m then we linearly search
locations with addresses h, hth’ ,h=2h’.h+3h’,.........
If m is a prime number then the above sequence will access all the locations in the table T.

Note: One major disadvantage in any type of open addressing procedure is in the
implementation of deletion.

Suppose a record r is deleted from location T(r) , suppose we reach this location during a search, it
does not mean the search is unsuccesssfull..

Thus when deleting a record the location should be labeled to indicate that previously it did contain a
record

Chaining
¢ Maintain one list per bucket
