24.1 Introduction to NOSQL Systems

= Some NOSQL systems, such as OrientDB, combine concepts from many of
the categories discussed above.

= In addition to the newer types of NOSQL systems listed above, it is also pos-
sible to classify database systems based on the object model (see Chapter 12)
or on the native XML model (see Chapter 13) as NOSQL systems, although
they may not have the high-performance and replication characteristics of
the other types of NOSQL systems.

These are just a few examples of NOSQL systems that have been developed. There
are many systems, and listing all of them is beyond the scope of our presentation.

24.1.2 Characteristics of NOSQL Systems

We now discuss the characteristics of many NOSQL systems, and how these sys-
tems differ from traditional SQL systems. We divide the characteristics into two
categories—those related to distributed databases and distributed systems, and
those related to data models and query languages.

NOSQL characteristics related to distributed databases and distributed
systems. NOSQL systems emphasize high availability, so replicating the data is
inherent in many of these systems. Scalability is another important characteristic,
because many of the applications that use NOSQL systems tend to have data that
keeps growing in volume. High performance is another required characteristic,
whereas serializable consistency may not be as important for some of the NOSQL
applications. We discuss some of these characteristics next.

1. Scalability: As we discussed in Section 23.1.4, there are two kinds of scal-
ability in distributed systems: horizontal and vertical. In NOSQL systems,
horizontal scalability is generally used, where the distributed system is
expanded by adding more nodes for data storage and processing as the vol-
ume of data grows. Vertical scalability, on the other hand, refers to expand-
ing the storage and computing power of existing nodes. In NOSQL systems,
horizontal scalability is employed while the system is operational, so tech-
niques for distributing the existing data among new nodes without inter-
rupting system operation are necessary. We will discuss some of these
techniques in Sections 24.3 through 24.6 when we discuss specific systems.

2. Availability, Replication and Eventual Consistency: Many applications
that use NOSQL systems require continuous system availability. To accom-
plish this, data is replicated over two or more nodes in a transparent man-
ner, so that if one node fails, the data is still available on other nodes.
Replication improves data availability and can also improve read perfor-
mance, because read requests can often be serviced from any of the repli-
cated data nodes. However, write performance becomes more cumbersome
because an update must be applied to every copy of the replicated data items;
this can slow down write performance if serializable consistency is required
(see Section 23.3). Many NOSQL applications do not require serializable
