Weighted Edges:

The edges of a graph are assigned weights. These weights may represent the distance from one
vertex to another or the cost of going from one vertex to an adjacent vertex. A graph with

weighted edges is called a network.
5.2 Elementary Graph Operations

Given an undirected graph, G = (V, E), and a vertex, v, in V(G) we wish to visit all vertices in
G that are reachable from v, that is, ail vertices that are connected to v. There are two ways of

doing this: depth first search and breadth first search.
5.2.1 Depth First Search

Depth first search is similar to a preorder tree traversal. We begin the search by visiting the
start vertex, v. visiting consists of printing the node's vertex field. Next, we select an unvisited

vertex, w, from v's adjacency list and carry out a depth first search on w. Eventually our search
reaches a vertex, M, that has no unvisited vertices on its adjacency list. At this point, we remove
a vertex from the stack and continue processing its adjacency list. Previously visited vertices
are discarded; unvisited vertices are visited and placed on the stack. The search terminates
when the stack is empty.

prince (*85d*,v);
for (w= graph(vl; wr w = w->link)
if (ivisiced(w->vertex))
a@itsi(w->vertex);

Depth first search

5.2.2 Breadth First Search

breadth first search resembles a level order tree traversal. Breadth first search starts at vertex v
and marks it as visited. It then visits each of the vertices on v's adjacency list. When we have

visited all the vertices on v's adjacency list, we visit all the unvisited vertices that are adjacent
