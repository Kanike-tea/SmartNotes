Let U=¢,, 0 = Cy (Cc, and c, are constants

These represent lines parallel to the co-ordinate axes in the w— ‘plane.
Hence (1) becomes x- y¥ = =¢,,2xy = Cy :
These are rectangular hyperbolas in the w-plane.

Also if u = ¢',.0 =, wehave v-y/ = ¢, 2xy = cy.

The region bounded by these curves is as follows.

z- plane w- plane

Now we shall show that x7- y= =¢ and 2x y= % interséct -orthiogonally.

We need to show that the product of the slope of the tangents at the point of i intersection
is equal to —1.

v-¥=c, : 2xy = c,

Differentiating these w.r.t. x we have,

Hence the curves intersect orthogonally. ; f
