> Acomputer consists of five functionally independent main parts: input, memory,

arithmetic and logic, output, and control units, as shown in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1 Basic functional units of a computer.
>» The input unit accepts coded information from human operators using devices such
as keyboards, or from other computers over digital communication lines.

» The information received is stored in the computer“s memory, either for later use or
to be processed immediately by the arithmetic and logic unit.

Vv

The processing steps are specified by a program that is also stored in the

memory.

Vv

Finally, the results are sent back to the outside world through the output unit.

Vv

All of these actions are coordinated by the control unit.

Vv

An interconnection network provides the means for the functional units to

exchange information and coordinate their actions «
Input Units
Computers accept coded information through input units.

The most common input device is the keyboard.

Vv wv

Whenever a key is pressed, the corresponding letter or digit is automatically translated
into its corresponding binary code and transmitted to the processor.

> Many other kinds of input devices for human-computer interaction are
available including the touchpad, mouse, joystick, and trackball.

» These are often used as graphic input devices in conjunction with displays.
