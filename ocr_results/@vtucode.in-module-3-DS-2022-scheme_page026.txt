DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

To perform inorder traversal make repeated calls to insucc () function

void tinorder (threadedpointer tree)
{
Threadedpointer temp = tree;
for(; 7){
temp = insucc(temp);
if (temp == tree) break;
printf (“%3c”, temp—data

}

Program: Inorder traversal of a threaded binary tree
Inserting a Node into a Threaded Binary Tree
In this case, the insertion of r as the right child of a node s is studied.
The cases for insertion are:
e Ifs has an empty right subtree, then the insertion is simple and diagrammed in Figure
e Ifthe right subtree of s is not empty, then this right subtree is made the right subtree of
r after insertion. When this is done, r becomes the inorder, predecessor of a node that has a
leftThread == true field, and consequently there is a thread which has to be updated to

point to r. The node containing this thread was previously the inorder successor of s.
