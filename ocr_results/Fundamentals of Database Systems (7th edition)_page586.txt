556 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures

Robotic arms write on multiple cartridges in parallel using multiple tape drives and
automatic labeling software to identify the backup cartridges. An example of a giant
library is the SL8500 model of Sun Storage Technology. The SL8500 scales from
1,450 to just over 10,000 slots and from 1 to 64 tape drives within each library. It
accepts both DLT/SDLT and LTO tapes. Up to 10 SL8500s can be connected within
a single library complex for over 100,000 slots and up to 640 drives. With 100,000
slots, the SL8500 can store 2.1 exabytes (exabyte = 1,000 petabytes, or million TB =
10**18 bytes). We defer the discussion of disk storage technology called RAID, and
of storage area networks, network-attached storage, and iSCSI storage systems, to
the end of the chapter.

16.3 Buffering of Blocks

When several blocks need to be transferred from disk to main memory and all the
block addresses are known, several buffers can be reserved in main memory to
speed up the transfer. While one buffer is being read or written, the CPU can pro-
cess data in the other buffer because an independent disk I/O processor (controller)
exists that, once started, can proceed to transfer a data block between memory and
disk independent of and in parallel to CPU processing.

Figure 16.3 illustrates how two processes can proceed in parallel. Processes A and B
are running concurrently in an interleaved fashion, whereas processes C and D are
running concurrently in a parallel fashion. When a single CPU controls multiple
processes, parallel execution is not possible. However, the processes can still run
concurrently in an interleaved way. Buffering is most useful when processes can
run concurrently in a parallel fashion, either because a separate disk I/O processor
is available or because multiple CPU processors exist.

Figure 16.4 illustrates how reading and processing can proceed in parallel when the
time required to process a disk block in memory is less than the time required to
