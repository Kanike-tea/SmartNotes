16.1 Introduction

We first give an overview of the various storage devices used for primary, second-
ary, and tertiary storage in Section 16.1.1, and in Section 16.1.2 we discuss how
databases are typically handled in the storage hierarchy.

16.1.1 Memory Hierarchies and Storage Devices!

Ina modern computer system, data resides and is transported throughout a hierar-
chy of storage media. The highest-speed memory is the most expensive and is
therefore available with the least capacity. The lowest-speed memory is offline tape
storage, which is essentially available in indefinite storage capacity.

At the primary storage level, the memory hierarchy includes, at the most expensive
end, cache memory, which is a static RAM (random access memory). Cache mem-
ory is typically used by the CPU to speed up execution of program instructions
using techniques such as prefetching and pipelining. The next level of primary stor-
age is DRAM (dynamic RAM), which provides the main work area for the CPU for
keeping program instructions and data. It is popularly called main memory. The
advantage of DRAM is its low cost, which continues to decrease; the drawback is its
volatility? and lower speed compared with static RAM.

At the secondary and tertiary storage level, the hierarchy includes magnetic disks;
mass storage in the form of CD-ROM (compact disk-read-only memory) and
DVD (digital video disk or digital versatile disk) devices; and finally tapes at the
least expensive end of the hierarchy. The storage capacity is measured in kilobytes
(Kbyte or 1,000 bytes), megabytes (MB or 1 million bytes), gigabytes (GB or 1 bil-
lion bytes), and even terabytes (1,000 GB). The word petabyte (1,000 terabytes or
10**15 bytes) is now becoming relevant in the context of very large repositories of
data in physics, astronomy, earth sciences, and other scientific applications.

Programs reside and execute in dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ). Gen-
erally, large permanent databases reside on secondary storage (magnetic disks), and
portions of the database are read into and written from buffers in main memory as
needed. Nowadays, personal computers and workstations have large main memo-
ries of hundreds of megabytes of RAM and DRAM, so it is becoming possible to
load a large part of the database into main memory. Eight to sixteen GB of main
memory is becoming commonplace on laptops, and servers with 256 GB capacity
are not uncommon. In some cases, entire databases can be kept in main memory
(with a backup copy on magnetic disk), which results in main memory databases;
these are particularly useful in real-time applications that require extremely fast
response times. An example is telephone switching applications, which store data-
bases that contain routing and line information in main memory.

Flash Memory. Between DRAM and magnetic disk storage, another form of
memory, flash memory, is becoming common, particularly because it is nonvolatile.

'The authors appreciate the valuable input of Dan Forsyth regarding the current status of storage
systems in enterprises. The authors also wish to thank Satish Damle for his suggestions.

Volatile memory typically loses its contents in case of a power outage, whereas nonvolatile memory
does not.
