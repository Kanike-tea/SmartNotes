2.6 Measuring Cache Efficiency

There are two terms used to characterize the cache efficiency of a program: the cache hit rate and
the cache miss rate. The hit rate is the number of cache hits divided by the total number of

memory requests over a given time interval. The value is expressed as a percentage:

. cache hits
hit rate = {| ———————} x 100

memory requests

The miss rate is similar in form: the total cache misses divided by the total number of memory
requests expressed as a percentage over a time interval. Note that the miss rate also equals 100

minus the hit rate.

The hit rate and miss rate can measure reads, writes, or both, which means that the terms can be
used to describe performance information in several ways. For example, there is a hit rate for

reads, a hit rate for writes, and other measures of hit and miss rates.

Two other terms used in cache performance measurement are the hit time—the time it takes to
access a memory location in the cache and the miss penalty—the time it takes to load a cache

line from main memory into cache.
