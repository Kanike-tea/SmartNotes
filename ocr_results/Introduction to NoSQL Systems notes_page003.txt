e Availability (AP): Allow orders to be placed even if the inventory data isn't fully
synchronized. Later, inconsistencies can be resolved (e.g., backordering items).

The right choice depends on the business priority—data integrity or user experience.

6. Criticisms and Evolution
While CAP is a helpful model, it has limitations:

e¢ Over-simplified: It assumes a binary presence of partition, but real systems often
operate under varying degrees of failure.

«Ignores latency: CAP doesn't consider how fast systems respond—an important
factor in real-time applications.

« Doesn't reflect modern distributed systems: Today, many systems aim for "eventual
consistency", tunable consistency, or strong consistency on specific operations.

Researchers have proposed more nuanced models like PACELC (if there is a Partition, choose
between Availability and Consistency; Else, choose between Latency and Consistency) to
capture real-world trade-offs better.

7. Summary

The CAP Theorem is a foundational concept for understanding distributed database systems.
It teaches that during network partitions, you must choose between consistency and
availability. In practice, partition tolerance is a requirement, so systems are designed to
favor one of the other two based on the application needs.

Combination Focuses On Example Systems

cP Consistency + Partition MongoDB, HBase

AP. Availability + Partition | Cassandra, DynamoDB

CA Consistency + Availability Relational DBs (non-distributed)

CAP helps developers design systems that align with business goals, ensuring the right
balance of performance, availability, and data integrity.
