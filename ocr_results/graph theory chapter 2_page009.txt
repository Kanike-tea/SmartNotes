2.2 Euler’s formula

If G is a planar graph, then G can be represented by a diagram in a plane in which the “
meet only at the vertices. Such a diagram divides the plane into a number of parts, cal
regions (or faces), of which exactly one part is unbounded. The number of edges that form
boundary of a region is called the degree of that region.” :
For example, in the diagram of a planar graph shown in Figure 2.20, the diagram a

"If a pendant edge is a part of the boundary of a tegion, then, by convention, this edge is counted ice
