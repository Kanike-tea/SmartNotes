DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

THE STACK ABSTRACT DATA TYPE

STACK

+ This is an ordered-list in which insertions(called push) and deletions(called pop) are made at
one end called the top

* Since last element inserted into a stack is first element removed, a stack is also known as a
LIFO list(Last In First Out).

When an element is inserted in a stack, the concept is called push, and when an element is
removed from the stack, the concept is called pop.

Trying to pop out an empty stack is called underflow and trying to push an element in a full

stack is called overflow.

: Inserting and deleting elements in astack

As shown in above figure, the elements areadded in the stack in the order A, B, C, D, E, then
E is the first element that is deleted from the stack and the last element is deleted from stack
is A. Figure illustrates this sequence of operations.

Since the last element inserted into.a stack is the first element removed, a stack is also known

as a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) list.

SYSTEM STACK
A stack used by a program at run-time to process function-calls is called system-stack.
+ When functions are invoked, programs
— create a stack-frame (or activation-record) &
— place the stack-frame on top of system-stack
+ Initially, stack-frame for invoked-function contains only
— pointer to previous stack-frame &
— return-address
+ The previous stack-frame pointer points to the stack-frame of the invoking-function while
return-address contains the location of the statement to be executed after the function
terminates.
¢ If one function invokes another function, local variables and parameters of the invoking-

function are added to its stack-frame.
