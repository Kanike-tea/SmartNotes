Chapter 6 Basic SQL

provides a higher-level declarative language interface, so the user only specifies
what the result is to be, leaving the actual optimization and decisions on how to
execute the query to the DBMS. Although SQL includes some features from rela-
tional algebra, it is based to a greater extent on the tuple relational calculus, which
we describe in Section 8.6. However, the SQL syntax is more user-friendly than
either of the two formal languages.

The name SQL is presently expanded as Structured Query Language. Originally,
SQL was called SEQUEL (Structured English QUEry Language) and was designed
and implemented at IBM Research as the interface for an experimental relational
database system called SYSTEM R. SQL is now the standard language for com-
mercial relational DBMSs. The standardization of SQL is a joint effort by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards
Organization (ISO), and the first SQL standard is called SQL-86 or SQL1. A
revised and much expanded standard called SQL-92 (also referred to as SQL2)
was subsequently developed. The next standard that is well-recognized is
SQL:1999, which started out as SQL3. Additional updates to the standard are
SQL:2003 and SQL:2006, which added XML features (see Chapter 13) among
other updates to the language. Another update in 2008 incorporated more object
database features into SQL (see Chapter 12), and a further update is SQL:2011.
We will try to cover the latest version of SQL as much as possible, but some of the
newer features are discussed in later chapters. It is also not possible to cover the
language in its entirety in this text. It is important to note that when new features
are added to SQL, it usually takes a few years for some of these features to make it
into the commercial SQL DBMSs.

SQL is a comprehensive database language: It has statements for data definitions,
queries, and updates. Hence, it is both a DDL and a DML. In addition, it has facili-
ties for defining views on the database, for specifying security and authorization,
for defining integrity constraints, and for specifying transaction controls. It also has
rules for embedding SQL statements into a general-purpose programming lan-
guage such as Java or C/C++."

The later SQL standards (starting with SQL:1999) are divided into a core specifica-
tion plus specialized extensions. The core is supposed to be implemented by all
RDBMS vendors that are SQL compliant. The extensions can be implemented as
optional modules to be purchased independently for specific database applications
such as data mining, spatial data, temporal data, data warehousing, online analyti-
cal processing (OLAP), multimedia data, and so on.

Because the subject of SQL is both important and extensive, we devote two chap-
ters to its basic features. In this chapter, Section 6.1 describes the SQL DDL com-
mands for creating schemas and tables, and gives an overview of the basic data
types in SQL. Section 6.2 presents how basic constraints such as key and referen-
tial integrity are specified. Section 6.3 describes the basic SQL constructs for

Originally, SQL had statements for creating and dropping indexes on the files that represent relations,
but these have been dropped from the SQL standard for some time.
