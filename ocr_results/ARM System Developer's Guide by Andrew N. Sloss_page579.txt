566 Chapter 15 The Future of the Architecture

15.5 SUMMARY

Table 15.15

The ARM architecture is nota static constant butis being developed and improved to suit the
applications required by today’s consumer devices. Although the ARMv5TE architecture
was very successful at adding some DSP support to the ARM, the ARMvé6 architecture
extends the DSP support as well as adding support for large multiprocessor systems.
Table 15.15 shows how these new technologies map to different processor cores.

ARM still concentrates on one of its key benefits—code density—and has recently
announced the Thumb-2 extension to its popular Thumb architecture. The new focus on
security with TrustZone gives ARM a leading edge in this area.

Expect many more innovations over the years to come!
