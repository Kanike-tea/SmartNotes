away, thus maintaining a uniform density of recording, as shown in Figure 16.2(b).
A technique called ZBR (zone bit recording) allows a range of cylinders to have the
same number of sectors per arc. For example, cylinders 0-99 may have one sector
per track, 100-199 may have two per track, and so on. A common sector size is 512

bytes. Not all disks have their tracks divided into sectors.

The division of a track into equal-sized disk blocks (or pages) is set by the operat-
ing system during disk formatting (or initialization). Block size is fixed during
initialization and cannot be changed dynamically. Typical disk block sizes range
