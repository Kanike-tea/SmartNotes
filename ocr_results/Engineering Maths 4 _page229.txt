Cauchy’s Residue Theorem.’

Hee)

Working os for problems to find j f(z)dz by using

Cauchy's residue theorem

* We locate all the poles of f (z) along with, their det by looking at -the
denominator of the given FEZ).

© We identify the poles lying inside C. ;

¢ We compute the residue for these poles using aperepile formula,

e

Finally we apply Cauchy's residue theorem :

J pczyaz =2ni=lR
€

where £ R denote the sum of the residue at the poles lying i in C.
Remark: Examples on the evaluation of J f (z)dz oy Cail Sintegral formula can also”

be done by applying Cauchy’s residue’ acral, When the method is’ not. spe
evaluation, residue method is preferable since partial fractions can be avoided..
