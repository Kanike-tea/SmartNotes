If A isthecéntre and r istheradiusof the givencircle,apoint P lies inside the circle

' +, ifthedistanée A P-islessthan r; outside the circle if the distance AP. is greater than

r. If AP =r, obviously P is a point on the circle.
In this problem we have “ :
Case-(i) : A=(0,0),P =(0,-n)ir=2n
“AP =< 2n = P isinside the circle.
Case-(ii) : A= (0,0); P=(0,-m); r= 9/2
AP = % >-0/2 = P is outside the circle,
