Database Management System [BCS403]

Primary key
It is common to designate one of the candidate keys as the primary key of the relation. This
is the candidate key whose values are used to identify tuples in the relation.We use the
convention that the attributes that form the primary key of a relation schema are underlined.

Other candidate keys are designated as unique keys and are not underlined

Another constraint on attributes specifies whether NULL values are or are not permitted. For
example, if every STUDENT tuple must have a valid, non-NULL value for the Name attribute, then
Name of STUDENT is constrained to be NOT NULL.

1.2.3 Relational Databases and Relational Database Schemas
A Relational database schema S is a set of relation schemas S = {R1, Ro, .., Rm} anda s et
of integrity constraints IC.
Example of relational database schema:
COMPANY = {EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, DEPT _LOCATIONS, PROJECT,
WORKS_ON, DEPENDENT}

EMPLOYEE

Fname | Minit | Lname | Ssn | Bdatey| Address [ersder| Salary | Super_ssn|] Dno
DEPARTMENT

Dname | Dnumber | Mgr_ssn | Mgfastart_date|

DEPT_LOCATIONS

Pname |, Pnumber | Plocation | Dnum

WORKS_ON
Essa. | Pno | Hours

DEPENDENT
Essn | Dependent_name | sender] Bdate l Relationship

The underlined attributes represent primary keys

A Relational database state is a set of relation states DB = {r1, r2, ..., rm}-Each ri is a state of

R and such that the 1; relation states satisfy integrity constraints specified in IC.
