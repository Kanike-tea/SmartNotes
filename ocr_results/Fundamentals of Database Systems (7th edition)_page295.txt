8.5 Examples of Queries in Relational Algebra

OUTER UNION can be applied to two relations whose schemas are STUDENT(Name,
Ssn, Department, Advisor) and INSTRUCTOR(Name, Ssn, Department, Rank). Tuples
from the two relations are matched based on having the same combination of
values of the shared attributes—Name, Ssn, Department. The resulting relation,
STUDENT_OR_INSTRUCTOR, will have the following attributes:

STUDENT_OR_INSTRUCTOR(Name, Ssn, Department, Advisor, Rank)

All the tuples from both relations are included in the result, but tuples with the
same (Name, Ssn, Department) combination will appear only once in the result.
Tuples appearing only in STUDENT will have a NULL for the Rank attribute, whereas
tuples appearing only in INSTRUCTOR will have a NULL for the Advisor attribute. A
tuple that exists in both relations, which represent a student who is also an instruc-
tor, will have values for all its attributes.’!

Notice that the same person may still appear twice in the result. For example, we
could have a graduate student in the Mathematics department who is an instructor
in the Computer Science department. Although the two tuples representing that
person in STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR will have the same (Name, Ssn) values, they
will not agree on the Department value, and so will not be matched. This is because
Department has two different meanings in STUDENT (the department where the per-
son studies) and INSTRUCTOR (the department where the person is employed as an
instructor). If we wanted to apply the OUTER UNION based on the same (Name, Ssn)
combination only, we should rename the Department attribute in each table to reflect
that they have different meanings and designate them as not being part of the
union-compatible attributes. For example, we could rename the attributes as
MajorDept in STUDENT and WorkDept in INSTRUCTOR.

8.5 Examples of Queries in Relational Algebra

The following are additional examples to illustrate the use of the relational alge-
bra operations. All examples refer to the database in Figure 5.6. In general, the
same query can be stated in numerous ways using the various operations. We will
state each query in one way and leave it to the reader to come up with equivalent
formulations.

Query 1. Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the
‘Research department.

RESEARCH_DEPT < Gpname=‘Research’(DEPARTMENT)
RESEARCH_EMPS < (RESEARCH_DEPT © pnumber-DnoEMPLOYEE)
RESULT < TiFname, Lname, Address(RESEARCH_EMPS)

Asa single in-line expression, this query becomes:

TEname, Lname, Address (Gdname=Research (DEPARTMENT © ppumber-Dno(EMPLOYEE))

"Note that OUTER UNION is equivalent to a FULL OUTER JOIN if the join attributes are ail the com-
mon attributes of the two relations.
