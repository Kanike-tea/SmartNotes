6.1 SQL Data Definition and Data Types

in SQL. For example, ‘abc’ || ‘XYZ’ results in a single string ‘abcXYZ’.
Another variable-length string data type called CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT
or CLOB is also available to specify columns that have large text values, such
as documents. The CLOB maximum length can be specified in kilobytes
(K), megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G). For example, CLOB(20M) specifies a
maximum length of 20 megabytes.

= Bit-string data types are either of fixed length n—BIT(n)—or varying length—
BIT VARYING(1), where n is the maximum number of bits. The default for n,
the length of a character string or bit string, is 1. Literal bit strings are placed
between single quotes but preceded by a B to distinguish them from character
strings; for example, B‘10101’.> Another variable-length bitstring data type
called BINARY LARGE OBJECT or BLOB is also available to specify columns
that have large binary values, such as images. As for CLOB, the maximum
length of a BLOB can be specified in kilobits (K), megabits (M), or gigabits (G).
For example, BLOB(30G) specifies a maximum length of 30 gigabits.

= A Boolean data type has the traditional values of TRUE or FALSE. In SQL,
because of the presence of NULL values, a three-valued logic is used, so a
third possible value for a Boolean data type is UNKNOWN. We discuss the
need for UNKNOWN and the three-valued logic in Chapter 7.

= The DATE data type has ten positions, and its components are YEAR, MONTH,
and DAY in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The TIME data type has at least eight
positions, with the components HOUR, MINUTE, and SECOND in the form
HH:MM:SS. Only valid dates and times should be allowed by the SQL imple-
mentation. This implies that months should be between 1 and 12 and days
must be between 01 and 31; furthermore, a day should be a valid day for the
corresponding month. The < (less than) comparison can be used with dates
or times—an earlier date is considered to be smaller than a later date, and
similarly with time. Literal values are represented by single-quoted strings
preceded by the keyword DATE or TIME; for example, DATE ‘2014-09-27’ or
TIME ‘09:12:47’. In addition, a data type TIME(i), where i is called time frac-
tional seconds precision, specifies i + 1 additional positions for TIME—one
position for an additional period (.) separator character, and i positions for
specifying decimal fractions of a second. A TIME WITH TIME ZONE data type
includes an additional six positions for specifying the displacement from the
standard universal time zone, which is in the range +13:00 to -12:59 in units
of HOURS:MINUTES. If WITH TIME ZONE is not included, the default is the
local time zone for the SQL session.

Some additional data types are discussed below. The list of types discussed here is
not exhaustive; different implementations have added more data types to SQL.

= A timestamp data type (TIMESTAMP) includes the DATE and TIME fields, plus
a minimum of six positions for decimal fractions of seconds and an optional
WITH TIME ZONE qualifier. Literal values are represented by single-quoted

SBit strings whose length is a multiple of 4 can be specified in hexadecimal notation, where the literal
string is preceded by X and each hexadecimal character represents 4 bits.
