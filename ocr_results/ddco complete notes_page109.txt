Digital Design &Computer Organization(BCS302) Module -4

e There are 3 mechanisms to solve problem of infinite loop:

1) Processor should ignore the interrupts until execution of first instruction of
the ISR.

2) Processor should automatically disable interrupts before starting the
execution of the ISR.

3) Processor has a special INTR line for which the interrupt-handling circuit.
Interrupt-circuit responds only to leading edge of signal. Such line
is called edge-triggered.
« Sequence of events involved in handling an interrupt-request:
1) The device raises an interrupt-request.
2) The processor interrupts the program currently being executed.

3) Interrupts are disabled by changing the control bits in the processor status
register (PS).

4) The device is informed that its request has been recognized. And in
response, the device deactivates the interrupt-request signal.

5) The action requested by the interrupt is performed by the interrupt-service
routine.

6) Interrupts are enabled and execution of the interrupted program is
resumed.

HANDLING MULTIPLE DEVICES
While handling multiple devices, the issues concerned are:
e How can the processor recognize the device requesting an interrupt?
e How can the processor obtain the starting address of the appropriate ISR?
e Should a device be allowed to interrupt the processor while
another interrupt is being serviced?
e¢ How should 2 or more simultaneous interrupt-requests be handled?

VECTORED INTERRUPT
¢ A device requesting an interrupt identifies itself by sending a special-code to
processor over bus.

¢ Then, the processor starts executing the ISR.
¢ The special-code indicates starting-address of ISR.
¢ The special-code length ranges from 4 to 8 bits.

¢ The location pointed to by the interrupting-device is used to store the staring
address toISR.
