18.3 Algorithms for SELECT Operation

= S7b—Using a functional index. (See Section 17.5.3.) In OP7, the selection con-
dition involves the expression ((Salary*Commission_pct) + Salary ).
If there is a functional index defined as (as shown in Section 17.5.3):

CREATE INDEX income_ix
ON EMPLOYEE (Salary + (Salary*Commission_pct));

then this index can be used to retrieve employee records that qualify. Note
that the exact way in which the function is written while creating the index is
immaterial.

In the next chapter, we discuss how to develop formulas that estimate the access
cost of these search methods in terms of the number of block accesses and access
time. Method $1 (linear search) applies to any file, but all the other methods
depend on having the appropriate access path on the attribute used in the selection
condition. Method $2 (binary search) requires the file to be sorted on the search
attribute. The methods that use an index (S3a, $4, $5, and $6) are generally referred
to as index searches, and they require the appropriate index to exist on the search
attribute. Methods S4 and S6 can be used to retrieve records in a certain range in
range queries. Method $7a (bitmap index search) is suitable for retrievals where
an attribute must match an enumerated set of values. Method $7b (functional
index search) is suitable when the match is based on a function of one or more
attributes on which a functional index exists.

18.3.2 Search Methods for Conjunctive Selection

If a condition of a SELECT operation is a conjunctive condition—that is, if it is
made up of several simple conditions connected with the AND logical connective
such as OP4 above—the DBMS can use the following additional methods to
implement the operation:

= $8—Conjunctive selection using an individual index. If an attribute
involved in any single simple condition in the conjunctive select condition
has an access path that permits the use of one of the methods S2 to S6, use
that condition to retrieve the records and then check whether each retrieved
record satisfies the remaining simple conditions in the conjunctive select
condition.

= $9—Conjunctive selection using a composite index. If two or more attri-
butes are involved in equality conditions in the conjunctive select condition
and a composite index (or hash structure) exists on the combined fields—
for example, if an index has been created on the composite key (Essn, Pno) of
the WORKS_ON file for OP5—we can use the index directly.

= $10—Conjunctive selection by intersection of record pointers.’ If second-
ary indexes (or other access paths) are available on more than one of the
fields involved in simple conditions in the conjunctive select condition, and if

°A record pointer uniquely identifies a record and provides the address of the record on disk; hence, itis
also called the record identifier or record id.
