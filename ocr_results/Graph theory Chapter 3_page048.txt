The given word consists of the letters EB} N, G;Ij'R, with frequencies 3, 3, 2, 2, 1 respectively.

t, we arrange these letters in the non-decreasing order of their frequencies (which may be

agarded as weights). Their representation as isolated verties is shown below.

We now construct an optimal tree having these letters as leaves by using the Huffman’s pro-
‘cedure. The graphs obtained in successive steps of the procedure are shown below in Figures
3.52(ii)-(v) in the order of their occurrence.’ The, labeled version of the final tree is shown in
