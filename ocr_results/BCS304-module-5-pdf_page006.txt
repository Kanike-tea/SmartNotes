4. Rehashing

When the hash table becomes nearly full, the number of collisions increases, thereby degrading

the performance of insertion and search operations. In such cases, a better option is to create a

new hash table with size double of the original hash table.

All the entries in the original hash table will then have to be moved to the new hash table.

This is done by taking each entry, computing its new hash value, and then inserting it in the new hash

table.
Though re

ashing seems to be a simple process, it is quite expensive and must therefore not

be done frequently.

Consider tl

e hash table of size 5 given below. The hash function used is h(x) = x % 5. Rehash the entries

into to a new hash table.

0

1 2 3 4

2 [ 31 | 43°] 7

Note that the new hash table is of 10 locations, double the size of the original table.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Now, rehash the key values from the old hash table into the new one using hash function—h(x)

=x % 10.

. Chaining

Chaining technique avoids collision using an array of liked lists (run time).If more than one key
has same hash value, then all the keys will be inserted at the end of the list (insert rear) one by
one and thus collision is avoided.

Example: Construct a hash table of size and store the following words: like, a, tree, you, first,
a, place, to

Let H(str)=P0+P1+P2+...... +Pn-1; where Pi is position of letter in English alphabet series.
Then calculate the hash address = Sum % 5
