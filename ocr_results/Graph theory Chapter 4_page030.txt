We repeat the process by considering the third, fourth,... iterations, and Stop the proces,

Finally, we collect together all the labeled arcs py, po,... (obtained in step 1 of each it
eration) and form the path from 1 to n constituted by them. This path, called a short path
arborescence, determines a shortest path (and its weight) from vertex 1 to every other verter,

Using the Dijkstra’s algorithm, obtain the shortest path from vertex | to each
of the other vertices in the weighted, directed network shown in Figure 4.53.* Indicate the
weights of these shortest paths,
