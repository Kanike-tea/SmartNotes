Module V

«Instruction Decoder & Control Unit is responsible for
— Decoding the instruction and issuing the control-signals to all the units
inside the processor.

— implementing the actions specified by the instruction (loaded in the IR).
«Processor Registers - Register RO through R(n-1) are also called

as GeneralPurpose Register.

The programmer can access these registers for general-purpose use.

«Temporary Registers — There are 3 temporary registers in the processor.
Registers

- Y, Z & Temp are used for temporary storage during program-

execution. The programmer cannot access these 3 registers.

In ALU,1) “A“ input gets the operand from the output of the multiplexer(MUX).

2) “B“ input gets the operand directly from the processor-bus.

¢There are 2 options provided for “A“ input of the ALU.

«MUX is used to select one of the 2 inputs.

«MUX selects either

— output of Y or

— constant-value 4( which is used to increment PC content).

«An instruction is executed by performing one or more of the following
operations:
