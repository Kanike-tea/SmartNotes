y = dy + OX + OX + gx? + Oyx* + asx ++

. Since constants ap, ay ... are in terms of % and Ay Asy ... are in terms of a, we
rearrange the RHS in the form

y = (ay + a,x $.dgX + se) + (a,x +052 + ag0 + vee)
On substituting for Any Mey My, Og... WE obtain

n(n+1) n(n+1)(n-2)(n+3) 1

_Let u(x) & v(x) respectively represent the two infinite series in (4) so that wehave

y = agu(x) + a,0(x) wwe'(5)
This is the series solution of Legendre’s differential equation.

© Legendre Polynomials

If n isa positive even integer, a) u(x) reduces to a polynomial of degree n and if

n isapositiveoddinteger a, v(x) reduces toa polynomial of degree n. Otherwise
. these will give infinite series called Legendre functions of second kind.

It may be observed that the polynomials u(x), v(x) contain alternate powers of

x and a general formof the polynomial that represents either of them in descending

powers of x can be presented in the form

y=f(x) sax ta, eta gett ee + E(x) ... (1)

% if n is even

whee. Ez) = a,x if n is odd

We note that a, is the coefficient of x’ in the series solution of the differential

equation and we have obtained, [ Refer (3) in the previous article]
