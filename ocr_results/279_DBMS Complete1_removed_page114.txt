Parallel Database
Aparallel database system performs parallel operations, such as loading data, building indexes
and evaluating queries.
Parallel databases can be roughly divided into two groups,
a) Multiprocessor architecture:

Shared memory architecture
Where multiple processors share the main memory space.

Shared disk architecture
Where each node has its own main memory, but all nodes share mass storage, usually a
storage area network. In practice, each node usually also has multiple processors.

Shared nothing architecture
Where each node has its own mass storage as well as main memory.

Shared-Nothing Architecture

b) The other architecture group is called hybrid architecture, which includes:

¢ Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA), which involves the non-uniform memory
access.
