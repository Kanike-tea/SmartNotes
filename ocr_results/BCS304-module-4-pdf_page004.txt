4.1.3 Height of a binary search tree:

Unless care is taken, the height of a binary search tree with n elements can become as large as
n. This is the case, for instance, when we use insert-node to insert the keys 1, 2, 3, * * *, n, in
that order, into an initially empty binary search tree. However, when insertion and deletions
are made at random using the above functions, the height of the binary search tree is O(log2n),
on the average.

4.2 SELECTION TREE:

4.2.1 Introduction:

Suppose we have k ordered, called and is in merged into single ordered sequence. Each run
consists of some records and is in non-decreasing order of a designated field called the key.
Let n be the number of records in all k runs together task can be by the record with the smallest
key. The smallest has to be found from k possibilities, and it could be the leading record in any
of the k runs. The most direct way to merge k runs is tomake k-1 to determine the next record
to output. For k > 2, we can achieve a reduction in the number of needed to find the next
smallest element by using the selection tree data structure. There are two kinds of selection
trees: winner trees and loser trees.

4.2.1 Winner Tree:

A winner tree is a binary tree in which each node represents the smaller of its two children.
Thus, the root mode the smallest node in the tree. Figure 5.32 illustrates a winner tree for the
case k= 8.

The of this winner tree may be compared to the playing of a tournament in which the winner
is the record with the smaller key. Then, each nonleaf node in the tree the winner of a , and the
root node the overall winner, or the smallest key. Each leaf node the first record in the
corresponding run. Since the records being merged are large, each node will contain only a
pointer to the record it represents. Thus, the root node contains a pointer to the first record in
run 4 A winner tree may be represented using the sequential allocation scheme for binary trees
that results from Lemma 5.4. The number above each node in Figure 5.32 is the address of the
node in this sequential. The record pointed to by the root has the smallest key and so may be

output. Now, the next record from run 4 enters the winner tree. It has a key value of 15, To the
tree, the tournament has to be replayed only along the path from node 11 to the root. Thus, the

winner from nodes 10 and 11 is again node 11 (15 <20) The winner from nodes 4 and 5 is node

49 <15) The winner from 2 and 3 is node 3 (8 < 9) The new tree is shown in Figure 5.33. The
