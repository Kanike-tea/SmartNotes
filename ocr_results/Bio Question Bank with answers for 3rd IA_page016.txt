to improve the performance of swimmers by reducing drag in the water.

Friction-reducing swim suits use a similar structure to that of shark skin to reduce drag and
improve swimmer performance. These suits are made from high-tech materials that mimic

the properties of shark skin, such as the shape and size of the denticles.

Materials Used

The materials used to create friction-reducing swim suits inspired by shark skin

include:

e Polyurethane: A type of polymer that is commonly used in the production of swim

suits, asit is durable and can be molded into a variety of shapes.

e Lycra/Spandex: Lycra and spandex are made from the same synthetic fiber, which is
technically called elastane. Elastane fibers are typically composed of a polymer called
polyurethane which is then blended with other fibers like nylon, polyester, or cotton)

that is known for its stretch and flexibility.

e High-tech fabrics: A range of high-tech fabrics have been developed specifically for use
in swim suits. These fabrics are designed to be lightweight, water-repellent, and

hydrodynamic, and often incorporate materials such as silicone or Teflon to reduce drag.

12. Discuss about Human blood substitutes.

Ans. Human Blood Substitutes (also known as artificial blood or oxygen therapeutics) are
substances developed to mimic and fulfill some functions of biological blood, particularly
transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide. They are primarily designed to temporarily replace
red blood cells (RBCs) in cases where blood transfusion is not possible or advisable.

Basic Requirement for Human Blood Substitutes
Effective Oxygen Transport:

Human blood substitutes must be capable of efficiently carrying and delivering oxygen to the
body's tissues. This is a fundamental function of natural blood that any substitute should be
able to replicate or improve upon.

Safety and Compatibility:

Blood substitutes should be safe for use in the human body and well-tolerated by the recipient.
They should not cause significant adverse reactions, toxicity, or immune responses.
Additionally, they should not interfere with normal blood clotting or other essential
physiological processes.

Storage and Transport:
