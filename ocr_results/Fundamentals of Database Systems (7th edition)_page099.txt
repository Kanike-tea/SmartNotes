its own right. The Registration attribute is an example of a composite key formed
from two simple component attributes, State and Number, neither of which is a key
on its own. An entity type may also have no key, in which case it is called a weak
entity type (see Section 3.5).

In our diagrammatic notation, if two attributes are underlined separately, then each
is a key on its own. Unlike the relational model (see Section 5.2.2), there is no con-
cept of primary key in the ER model that we present here; the primary key will be
chosen during mapping to a relational schema (see Chapter 9).

Value Sets (Domains) of Attributes. Each simple attribute of an entity type is
associated with a value set (or domain of values), which specifies the set of values
that may be assigned to that attribute for each individual entity. In Figure 3.6, if the
range of ages allowed for employees is between 16 and 70, we can specify the value
set of the Age attribute of EMPLOYEE to be the set of integer numbers between 16
and 70. Similarly, we can specify the value set for the Name attribute to be the set of
strings of alphabetic characters separated by blank characters, and so on. Value sets
are not typically displayed in basic ER diagrams and are similar to the basic data
types available in most programming languages, such as integer, string, Boolean,
float, enumerated type, subrange, and so on. However, data types of attributes can
