and brought into service for mining operations as needed using OLAP (online ana-
lytical processing) servers. Not only are multimedia databases growing, but, in
addition, image storage and retrieval are slow operations. Also, the cost of second-
ary storage is decreasing, so massive information storage will be feasible, even for
small companies. Thus, data mining programs will have to deal with larger sets of
data of more companies.

Most of data mining software will use the ODBC standard to extract data from
business databases; proprietary input formats can be expected to disappear.
There is a definite need to include nonstandard data, including images and other
multimedia data, as source data for data mining.
