10.1 Overview of Database Programming Techniques and Issues

Impedance mismatch is less of a problem when a special database programming
language is designed that uses the same data model and data types as the database
model. One example of such a language is Oracle’s PL/SQL. The SQL standard also
has a proposal for such a database programming language, known as SQL/PSM. For
object databases, the object data model (see Chapter 12) is quite similar to the data
model of the Java programming language, so the impedance mismatch is greatly
reduced when Java is used as the host language for accessing a Java-compatible
object database. Several database programming languages have been implemented
as research prototypes (see the Selected Bibliography).

10.1.3 Typical Sequence of Interaction
in Database Programming

When a programmer or software engineer writes a program that requires access to
a database, it is quite common for the program to be running on one computer
system while the database is installed on another. Recall from Section 2.5 that a
common architecture for database access is the three-tier client/server model,
where a top-tier client program handles display of information on a laptop or
mobile device usually as a Web client or mobile app, a middle-tier application
program implements the logic of a business software application but includes some
calls to one or more database servers at the bottom tier to access or update the
data.? When writing such an application program, a common sequence of interac-
tion is the following:

1. When the application program requires access to a particular database, the
program must first establish or open a connection to the database server.
Typically, this involves specifying the Internet address (URL) of the machine
where the database server is located, plus providing a login account name
and password for database access.

2. Once the connection is established, the program can interact with the database
by submitting queries, updates, and other database commands. In general,
most types of SQL statements can be included in an application program.

3. When the program no longer needs access to a particular database, it should
terminate or close the connection to the database.

A program can access multiple databases if needed. In some database programming
approaches, only one connection can be active at a time, whereas in other
approaches multiple connections can be established simultaneously.

In the next three sections, we discuss examples of each of the three main approaches
to database programming. Section 10.2 describes how SQL is embedded into a pro-
gramming language. Section 10.3 discusses how function calls and class libraries are
used to access the database using SQL/CLI (similar to ODBC) and JDBC, and Sec-
tion 10.4 discusses an extension to SQL called SQL/PSM that allows general-purpose

2s we discussed in Section 2.5, there are two-tier and three-tier architectures; to keep our discussion
simple, we will assume a two-tier client/server architecture here.
