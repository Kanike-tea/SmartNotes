In a set of objects, X, where
X= (x1, Xo, -. «J,
a binary relation R between pairs (x;, xj) may exist. In which case, we write
x)Rx;

and say that x; has relation R to x;.

Relation R may for instance be “is parallel to, is
congruent to” in geometry. It may be “is greater than,” “is a factor of,” “is equal
to,” and so on, in the case when X consists of numbers. On the other hand, if the
set X is composed of people, the relation R may be “is son of,” “is spouse of,” “is
friend of,” and so forth. Each of these relations is defined only on pairs of
numbers of the set, and this is why the name binary relation. Although there are
relations other than binary (x; “is a product of” xj and x;,, for example, will be a
tertiary relation), binary relations are the most important in mathematics, and the
word “relation” implies a binary relation.

A digraph is the most natural way of representing a binary relation on a set X.
Each x; € X is represented by a vertex x; If x; has the specified relation R to x), a
directed edge is drawn from vertex x; to x; for every pair (x; x;). For example, the
digraph in Fig. 9-4 represents the relation “is greater than” on a set consisting of
five numbers (3, 4, 7, 5, 8}.

Clearly, every binary relation on a finite set can be represented by a digraph
without parallel edges. Conversely, every digraph without parallel edges defines
a binary relation on the set of its vertices.
