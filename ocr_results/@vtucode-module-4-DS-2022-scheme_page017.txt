5.1.3 Graph representations

Adjacency Matrix:

Let G = (V, E) be a graph with n vertices, n>= 1. The adjacency matrix of G is a two-
dimensional n x n array, say adj-mat. If the edge (Vi, Vj) (<Vi,V\>for a digraph) is in E(G),
adj-mat[i][j] = 1. If there is no such edge in E(G), adj~mat{i}[j] = 0. The adjacency matrices
for graphs Gi, G3, and G4 are shown in Figure. The adjacency matrix for an undirected graph
is symmetric since the edge (v,, v,) is in E(G) iff the edge (vj, V|) is also in E(G). In contrast,
the adjacency matrix for a digraph need not be symmetric. (This is true of G3.) ) For undirected

graphs, we can save space by storing only the upper or lower triangle of the matrix.
