GRAD_STUDENTs will be a subset of STUDENTs. At the same time, individual
STUDENT and FACULTY objects will inherit the properties (attributes and rela-
tionships) and operations of PERSON, and individual GRAD_STUDENT objects
will inherit those of STUDENT.

The classes DEPARTMENT, COURSE, SECTION, and CURR_SECTION in Figure 12.10
are straightforward mappings of the corresponding entity types in Figure 12.9(b).
