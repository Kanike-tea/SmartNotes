Critical Region:

A critical region, also known as the rejection region, is a set of values for the test statistic for which the null
hypothesis is rejected. i.e. if the observed test statistic is in the critical region then we reject the null hypothesis and
accept the alternative hypothesis.

Type I and Type IJ Errors:
When we test a statistic at specified confidence level, there are chances of taking wrong decisions due to

small sample size or sampling fluctuations etc.
Type I error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis, ie. we rejectH, when itis true, whereas
Type II error is the incorrect acceptance of a false null hypothesis, i.e. we accept H¢ when it is false.

One Tailed and Two Tailed Tests:

While testing statistical significance levels; one- tailed test and a two-tailed test are used for accepting or
rejecting a hypothesis. One- tailed tests are used for asymmetric distributions (reference value is unidirectional)
whichhave a single tail; such as the chi-square distribution.

A two-tailed test is appropriate if the estimated value may lie on both sides of reference value. Two-
tailed tests are only applicable when the probability curve has two tails; such as normal distribution.

Test of hypothesis:
Let x be the observed number of successes in a sample size of n and u = np be the expected number of successes .Then
the standard normal variate Zis defined as
xm
z=
a npg

x=np

Test of hypothesis for means:
Let fy , Mz be the means, o,, 02 be the standard deviations of two populations and x, 2 are the
means of the samples, then

Z=& If the samples are drawn from the same population, then 0, = 02 = o we have

PROBLEMS
1) A coin is tossed 1000 times and head turns up 540 times. Decide on the hypothesis that the
coin is unbiased at 1 % level of significance.
Sol.
Let us suppose that the coin is unbiased.
and let p= the probability of getting a head in one toss=1/2=0.5
Since p+q=1, q=1-p=1/2=0.5
Expected number of heads in 1000 tosses=np=1000x0.5=500 , npq=250
-. The difference is x —  =540-500=40
-. Consider z=74#i@

= 2 = Te = 2.53 < 2.58

1% level of significance = 99% confidence level.
Therefore accept the hypothesis that the coin is unbiased.

2) A coin is tossed 400 times and turns up head 216 times. Test the hypothesis that the coin is unbiased
at 5%level of significance.
Sol.
Let us suppose that the coin is unbiased.
and let p= the probability of getting a head in one toss=1/2=0.5
Since p+q=1, q=1-p=1/2=0.5
