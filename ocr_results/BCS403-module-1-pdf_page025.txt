Database Management System [BCS403]

Query optimizer -concerned with the rearrangement and possible reordering of
operations, elimination of redundancies, and use of correct algorithms and indexes during
execution. It consults the system catalog for statistical and other physical information
about the stored data and generates executable code that performs the necessary operations
for the query and makes calls on the runtime processor.
Precompiler - extracts DML commands from an application program and sends to the
DML compiler for compilation into object code for database access.
Host language compiler - rest of the program is sent to the host language compiler. The
object codes for the DML commands and the rest of the program are linked, forming a
canned transaction whose executable code includes calls to the runtime database processor.
Runtime database processor executes:
(1) the privileged commands
(2) the executable query plans, and
(3) the canned transactions with runtime parameters.
It works with the system catalog and may update it withstatistics. It also works with the stored
data manager, which in turn uses basic operating system services for carrying out low-level
input/output (read/write) operations between the disk and main memory. The runtime database
processor handles other aspects of data transfer, such as management of buffers in the main
memory.

concurrency control and backup and recovery systems integrated into the working of the

runtime database processor for purposes of transaction management.

2.4.2 Database System Utilities
Database utilities help the DBA to manage the database system. Common utilities

have the following types of functions:

= Loading: used to load existing data files—such as text files or sequential files—into the
database.

= Backup: creates a backup copy of the database, usually by dumping the entire database onto
tape or other mass storage medium. The backup copy can be used to restore the database in case
of catastrophic disk failure. Incremental backups are also often used, where only changes since
the previous backup are recorded. Incremental backup is more complex, but saves storage

space.
