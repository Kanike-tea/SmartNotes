system. In addition to storing catalog information about schemas and constraints,
the data dictionary stores other information, such as design decisions, usage stan-
dards, application program descriptions, and user information. Such a system is
also called an information repository. This information can be accessed directly by
users or the DBA when needed. A data dictionary utility is similar to the DBMS
catalog, but it includes a wider variety of information and is accessed mainly by
users rather than by the DBMS software.

Application development environments, such as PowerBuilder (Sybase)
or JBuilder (Borland), have been quite popular. These systems provide an environ-
ment for developing database applications and include facilities that help in many
facets of database systems, including database design, GUI development, querying
and updating, and application program development.

The DBMS also needs to interface with communications software, whose function
is to allow users at locations remote from the database system site to access the
database through computer terminals, workstations, or personal computers. These
are connected to the database site through data communications hardware such as
Internet routers, phone lines, long-haul networks, local networks, or satellite com-
munication devices. Many commercial database systems have communication
packages that work with the DBMS. The integrated DBMS and data communica-
tions system is called a DB/DC system. In addition, some distributed DBMSs are
physically distributed over multiple machines. In this case, communications net-
works are needed to connect the machines. These are often local area networks
(LANs), but they can also be other types of networks.

2.5 Centralized and Client/Server
Architectures for DBMSs

2.5.1 Centralized DBMSs Architecture

Architectures for DBMSs have followed trends similar to those for general com-
puter system architectures. Older architectures used mainframe computers to pro-
vide the main processing for all system functions, including user application
programs and user interface programs, as well as all the DBMS functionality. The
reason was that in older systems, most users accessed the DBMS via computer ter-
minals that did not have processing power and only provided display capabilities.
Therefore, all processing was performed remotely on the computer system housing
the DBMS, and only display information and controls were sent from the computer
to the display terminals, which were connected to the central computer via various
types of communications networks.

As prices of hardware declined, most users replaced their terminals with PCs and
workstations, and more recently with mobile devices. At first, database systems
used these computers similarly to how they had used display terminals, so that the
DBMS itself was still a centralized DBMS in which all the DBMS functionality,
