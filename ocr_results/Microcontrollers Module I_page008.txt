bit loads. This obviously has the effect of reducing system performance, but the benefit is that
16-bit memory is less expensive.

In contrast, if the core executes 16-bit Thumb instructions, it will achieve better performance
with a 16-bit memory. The higher performance is a result of the core making only a single
fetch to memory to load an instruction. Hence, using Thumb instructions with 16-bit-wide
memory devices provides both improved performance and reduced cost.

Table 1 summarizes theoretical cycle times on an ARM processor using different memory

width devices.

Types
There are different types of memory.
Read-only memory (ROM):
e It is the least flexible of all memory types because it contains an image that is
permanently set at production time and cannot be reprogrammed.
e¢ ROMs are used in high volume devices that require no updates or corrections.

¢ Many devices also use a ROM to hold boot code.

Flash ROM:
e It can be written to as well as read, but it is slow to write. So it shouldn’t be used for
holding dynamic data.
e Its main use is for holding the device firmware or storing long term data that needs to
be preserved after power is off.
e The erasing and writing of flash ROM are completely software controlled with no

additional hardware circuitry required, which reduces the manufacturing co:

e Flash ROM has become the most popular of the read-only memory types and is
currently being used as an alternative for mass or secondary storage.
Dynamic random access memory (DRAM):
e It is the most commonly used RAM for devices.
e It has the lowest cost per megabyte compared with other types of RAM.
e DRAM is dynamic it needs to have its storage cells refreshed and given a new

electronic charge every few milliseconds.
