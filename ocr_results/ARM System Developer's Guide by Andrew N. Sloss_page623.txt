STC Store to coprocessor single or multiple 32-bit values

2. $TC<cond>{L} <copro>, Cd, [Rn], #{-}<immed8>*4 ARMv2
3. $TC<cond>{L} <copro>, Cd, [Rn], <option> ARMv2
4. STC2{L} <copro>, Cd, [Rn {, #{-}<immed8>*4}]{!} ARMv5
5. STC2{L} <copro>, Cd, [Rn], #{-}<immed8>*4 ARMV5
6. STC2{L} <copro>, Cd, [Rn], <option> ARMV5
These instructions initiate a memory write, transferring data to memory from the given
coprocessor. <copro> is the number of the coprocessor in the range p0 to p15. The core
takes an undefined instruction trap if the coprocessor is not present. The memory write
consists of a sequence of words to sequentially increasing addresses. The initial address
is specified by the addressing mode in Table A.10. The coprocessor controls the number
of words transferred, up to a maximum limit of 16 words. The fields {L} and Cd are
interpreted by the coprocessor and ignored by the ARM. Typically Cd specifies the source
coprocessor register for the transfer. The <option> field is an eight-bit integer enclosed in
{}. Its interpretation is coprocessor dependent.
If the address is not a multiple of four, then the access is unaligned. The restrictions on
an unaligned access are the same as for STM.

STM Store multiple 32-bit registers to memory

1. STM<cond><a mode> Rn{!}, <register_list>({*} ARMV1

2. STMIA Rn!, <register_list> THUMBv1

These instructions store multiple words to sequential memory addresses. The
<register_list> specifies a list of registers to store, enclosed in curly brackets {}. Although the
