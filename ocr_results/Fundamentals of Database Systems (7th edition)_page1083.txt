27.7 Web Search and Analysis

relationships linking them—are used to address the issues of semantic heterogene-
ity in data sources. Different classes of approaches are used for information integra-
tion using ontologies.

= Single ontology approaches use one global ontology that provides a shared
vocabulary for the specification of the semantics. They work if all informa-
tion sources to be integrated provide nearly the same view on a domain of
knowledge. For example, UMLS (described in Section 27.4.3) can serve as a
common ontology for biomedical applications.

= Ina multiple ontology approach, each information source is described by
its own ontology. In principle, the “source ontology” can be a combination
of several other ontologies, but it cannot be assumed that the different
“source ontologies” share the same vocabulary. Dealing with multiple, par-
tially overlapping, and potentially conflicting ontologies is a difficult prob-
lem faced by many applications, including those in bioinformatics and other
complex topics of study.

Building Concept Hierarchies. One common way of organizing search results is
via a linear ranked list of documents. But for some users and applications, a better
way to display results would be to create groupings of related documents in the
search result. One way of organizing documents in a search result, and for organiz-
ing information in general, is by creating a concept hierarchy. The documents in a
search result are organized into groups in a hierarchical fashion. Other related tech-
niques to organize docments are through classification and clustering (see Chap-
ter 28). Clustering creates groups of documents, where the documents in each
group share many common concepts.

Segmenting Web Pages and Detecting Noise. There are many superfluous
parts ina Web document, such as advertisements and navigation panels. The infor-
mation and text in these superfluous parts should be eliminated as noise before
classifying the documents based on their content. Hence, before applying classifica-
tion or clustering algorithms to a set of documents, the areas or blocks of the docu-
ments that contain noise should be removed.

27.7.5 Approaches to Web Content Analysis

The two main approaches to Web content analysis are (1) agent based (IR view)
and (2) database based (DB view).

The agent-based approach involves the development of sophisticated artificial
intelligence systems that can act autonomously or semi-autonomously on
behalf of a particular user, to discover and process Web-based information.
Generally, the agent-based Web analysis systems can be placed into the follow-
ing three categories:

= Intelligent Web agents are software agents that search for relevant infor-
mation using characteristics of a particular application domain (and possi-
bly a user profile) to organize and interpret the discovered information. For
