COMPLEX VARIABLES So 237
2, The cross ratio of a set of 4 poitits (P,, P,, Py P,) is defined by
(Py = Pp) (Ps ~ Py)
(P, - Ps) (Py - P,)

3. Invariant ‘points ; If a point z maps onto itself, that is w = z under the bilinear

transformation then the point is called an invariant point or a fixed point of the bilinear
transformation. :

4. Bilinear transformation is also called Mobius Transformation.
Theorems on Bilinear Transformation
ration
Theorem-1 If w is a bilinear transformation of z then z is a bilinear transformation of w.
Also if z is a bilinear transformation of t then w is a bilinear transformation oft.
az+b
cz+d

| Proof: By data: w = where ad - bc # 0

ie, w(ezt+d)=az+b

or 2(cw.- a) =-dw.+b Be a gee &

‘Ais Fw (Pm OVA) = (Het + be ad—be
dw : (ew - a) . (cw - a)?
Since ad - bc # 0 by data,

dw+b

we conclude that z isa bilinear transformation of w,
Further z = ————
cw —

is called the inverse bilinear transformation.

Further if w isa bilinear transformation of z and z isa bilinear transformation of t,
. we shall prove that: w_ is a bilinear’ transformation of t.
