24.7 Summary

In this chapter, we discussed the class of database systems known as NOSQL sys-
tems, which focus on efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of “big data.”
Applications that use these types of systems include social media, Web links, user
profiles, marketing and sales, posts and tweets, road maps and spatial data, and
e-mail. The term NOSQL is generally interpreted as Not Only SQL—rather than
NO to SQL—and is meant to convey that many applications need systems other
than traditional relational SQL systems to augment their data management needs.
These systems are distributed databases or distributed storage systems, with a focus
on semistructured data storage, high performance, availability, data replication,
and scalability rather than an emphasis on immediate data consistency, powerful
query languages, and structured data storage.

In Section 24.1, we started with an introduction to NOSQL systems, their charac-
teristics, and how they differ from SQL systems. Four general categories of NOSQL
systems are document-based, key-value stores, column-based, and graph-based.
In Section 24.2, we discussed how NOSQL systems approach the issue of consis-
tency among multiple replicas (copies) by using the paradigm known as eventual
consistency. We discussed the CAP theorem, which can be used to understand the
emphasis of NOSQL systems on availability. In Sections 24.3 through 24.6, we
presented an overview of each of the four main categories of NOSQL systems—
starting with document-based systems in Section 24.3, followed by key-value
stores in Section 24.4, then column-based systems in Section 24.5, and finally
graph-based systems in Section 24.6. We also noted that some NOSQL systems
may not fall neatly into a single category but rather use techniques that span two
or more categories.

Review Questions
