Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

This level applies only to schemas of base relations—which will be physically stored
as files—whereas at the logical level we are interested in schemas of both base rela-
tions and views (virtual relations). The relational database design theory developed
in this chapter applies mainly to base relations, although some criteria of appropri-

ateness also apply to views, as shown in Section 14.1.

As with many design problems, database design may be performed using two
approaches: bottom-up or top-down. A bottom-up design methodology (also called
design by synthesis) considers the basic relationships among individual attributes as
the starting point and uses those to construct relation schemas. This approach is not
very popular in practice! because it suffers from the problem of having to collect a
large number of binary relationships among attributes as the starting point. For prac-
tical situations, it is next to impossible to capture binary relationships among all such
pairs of attributes. In contrast, a top-down design methodology (also called design by
analysis) starts with a number of groupings of attributes into relations that exist
together naturally, for example, on an invoice, a form, or a report. The relations are
then analyzed individually and collectively, leading to further decomposition until all
desirable properties are met. The theory described in this chapter is applicable pri-
marily to the top-down design approach, and as such is more appropriate when per-
forming design of databases by analysis and decomposition of sets of attributes that

appear together in files, in reports, and on forms in real-life situations.

Relational database design ultimately produces a set of relations. The implicit goals
of the design activity are information preservation and minimum redundancy.
Information is very hard to quantify—hence we consider information preservation
in terms of maintaining all concepts, including attribute types, entity types, and
relationship types as well as generalization/specialization relationships, which are
described using a model such as the EER model. Thus, the relational design must
preserve all of these concepts, which are originally captured in the conceptual
design after the conceptual to logical design mapping. Minimizing redundancy
implies minimizing redundant storage of the same information and reducing the
need for multiple updates to maintain consistency across multiple copies of the
same information in response to real-world events that require making an update.

We start this chapter by informally discussing some criteria for good and bad rela-
tion schemas in Section 14.1. In Section 14.2, we define the concept of functional
dependency, a formal constraint among attributes that is the main tool for formally
measuring the appropriateness of attribute groupings into relation schemas. In Sec-
tion 14.3, we discuss normal forms and the process of normalization using func-
tional dependencies. Successive normal forms are defined to meet a set of desirable
constraints expressed using primary keys and functional dependencies. The normal-
ization procedure consists of applying a series of tests to relations to meet these
increasingly stringent requirements and decompose the relations when necessary. In
Section 14.4, we discuss more general definitions of normal forms that can be directly

'An exception in which this approach is used in practice is based on a model called the binary relational

model. An example is the NIAM methodology (Verheijen and VanBekkum, 1982).
