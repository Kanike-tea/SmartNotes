1124 Chapter 30 Database Security

A security problem common to computer systems is that of preventing unauthor-
ized persons from accessing the system itself, either to obtain information or to
make malicious changes in a portion of the database. The security mechanism of a
DBMS must include provisions for restricting access to the database system as a
whole. This function, called access control, is handled by creating user accounts
and passwords to control the login process by the DBMS. We discuss access control
techniques in Section 30.1.3.

Statistical databases are used to provide statistical information or summaries of
values based on various criteria. For example, a database for population statistics
may provide statistics based on age groups, income levels, household size, educa-
tion levels, and other criteria. Statistical database users such as government statis-
ticians or market research firms are allowed to access the database to retrieve
statistical information about a population but not to access the detailed confiden-
tial information about specific individuals. Security for statistical databases must
ensure that information about individuals cannot be accessed. It is sometimes
possible to deduce or infer certain facts concerning individuals from queries that
involve only summary statistics on groups; consequently, this must not be per-
mitted either. This problem, called statistical database security, is discussed
briefly in Section 30.4. The corresponding control measures are called inference
control measures.

Another security issue is that of flow control, which prevents information from
flowing in such a way that it reaches unauthorized users. Flow control is discussed
in Section 30.6. Covert channels are pathways on which information flows implic-
itly in ways that violate the security policy of an organization. We briefly discuss
some issues related to covert channels in Section 30.6.1.

A final control measure is data encryption, which is used to protect sensitive data
(such as credit card numbers) that is transmitted via some type of communications
network. Encryption can be used to provide additional protection for sensitive por-
tions of a database as well. The data is encoded using some coding algorithm. An
unauthorized user who accesses encoded data will have difficulty deciphering it,
but authorized users are given decoding or decrypting algorithms (or keys) to deci-
pher the data. Encrypting techniques that are very difficult to decode without a key
have been developed for military applications. However, encrypted database
records are used today in both private organizations and governmental and mili-
tary applications. In fact, state and federal laws prescribe encryption for any system
that deals with legally protected personal information. For example, according to
Georgia Law (OCGA 10-1-911):

“Personal information” means an individual's first name or first initial and last
name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements,
when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted or redacted:
