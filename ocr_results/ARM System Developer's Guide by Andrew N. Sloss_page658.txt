Field Use

N Negative flag, records bit 31 of the result of flag-setting operations.

Z Zero flag, records if the result of a flag-setting operation is zero.

c Carry flag, records unsigned overflow for addition, not-borrow for subtraction, and is
also used by the shifting circuit. See Table A.3.

V Overflow flag, records signed overflows for flag-setting operations.

Q Saturation flag. Certain operations set this flag on saturation. See for example QADD in
Appendix A (ARMySE and above).

J J = 1 indicates Java execution (must have T = 0). Use the BXd instruction to change
this bit (ARMv5] and above).

Res ‘These bits are reserved for future expansion. Software should preserve the values
in these bits.

GE[3:0] The SIMD greater-or-equal flags. See SADD in Appendix A (ARMv6).

E Controls the data endianness. See SETEND in Appendix A (ARMv6).

A A = | disables imprecise data aborts (ARMv6).

I I = 1 disables IRQ interrupts.

F F = 1 disables FIQ interrupts.

T T = 1 indicates Thumb state. T = 0 indicates ARM state. Use the BX or BLX instructions
to change this bit (ARMv4T and above).

mode ‘The current processor mode. See Table B.4.
