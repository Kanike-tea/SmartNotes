Index mode
* The operation is indicated as X(Ri)
where X=the constant value which defines an offset(also called a displacement).
Ri=the name of the index register which contains address of a new location.
* The effective-address of the operand is given by EA=X+[Ri]
* The contents of the index-register are not changed in the process of generating the effective-
address.
+ The constant X may be given either
— as an explicit number or
— as a symbolic-name representing a numerical value.

+ Fig(a) illustrates two ways of using the Index mode. In fig(a), the index register, Rl, contains the
address of a memory-location, and the value X defines an offset(also called a displacement) from this
address to the location where the operand is found.
+ To find EA of operand: Eg: Add 20(R1),

R2

EA=>1000+20=1020

+ An alternative use is illustrated in fig(b). Here, the constant X corresponds to a memory address, and
the contents of the index register define the offset to the operand. In either case, the effective-address is
the sum of two values; one is given explicitly in the instruction, and the other is stored in aregister.
