Selected Bibliography

(1984), Shapiro (1986), Kitsuregawa et al. (1989), and Blakeley and Martin (1990),
among others. Blakely et al. (1986) discuss maintenance of materialized views.
Chaudhari et al. (1995) discuss optimization of queries with materialized views.
Approaches to finding a good join order are presented in Ioannidis and Kang
(1990) and in Swami and Gupta (1989). A discussion of the implications of left-
deep and bushy join trees is presented in Ioannidis and Kang (1991). Kim (1982)
discusses transformations of nested SQL queries into canonical representations.
Optimization of aggregate functions is discussed in Klug (1982) and Muralikrishna
(1992). Query optimization with Group By is presented in Chaudhari and Shim
(1994). Yan and Larson (1995) discuss eager and lazy aggregation. Salzberg et al.
(1990) describe a fast external sorting algorithm. Estimating the size of temporary
relations is crucial for query optimization. Sampling-based estimation schemes are
presented in Haas et al. (1995), Haas and Swami (1995), and Lipton et al. (1990).
Having the database system store and use more detailed statistics in the form of
histograms is the topic of Muralikrishna and DeWitt (1988) and Poosala et al.
(1996). Galindo-Legaria and Joshi (2001) discuss nested subquery and aggregation
optimization.

O'Neil and Graefe (1995) discuss multi-table joins using bitmap indexes. Kim et al.
(1985) discuss advanced topics in query optimization. Semantic query optimization
is discussed in King (1981) and Malley and Zdonick (1986). Work on semantic
query optimization is reported in Chakravarthy et al. (1990), Shenoy and Ozsoyo-
glu (1989), and Siegel et al. (1992). Volcano, a query optimizer based on query
equivalence rules, was developed by Graefe and Mckenna (1993). Volcano and the
follow-on Cascades approach by Graefe (1995) are the basis for Microsoft's SQL
Server query optimization. Carey and Kossman (1998) and Bruno et al. (2002) pres-
ent approaches to query optimization for top-k results. Galindo Legaria et al. (2004)
discuss processing and optimizing database updates.

Ahmed et al. (2006) discuss cost-based query transformation in Oracle and give a
good overview of the global query optimization architecture in Oracle 10g. Ziaud-
din et al. (2008) discuss the idea of making the optimizer change the execution plan
for a query. They discuss Oracle’s SQL plan management (SPM) feature, which
lends stability to performance. Bellamkonda et al. (2009) provide additional tech-
niques for query optimization. Ahmed et al. (2014) consider the advantages of
bushy trees over alternatives for execution. Witkowski et al. (2003) discuss support
for N-dimensional array-based computation for analytics that has been integrated
into the Oracle RDBMS engine.
