spatial data. Queries posed on these spatial data, where predicates for selection deal
with spatial parameters, are called spatial queries. For example, “What are the
names of all bookstores within five miles of the College of Computing building at
Georgia Tech?” is a spatial query. Whereas typical databases process numeric and
character data, additional functionality needs to be added for databases to process
spatial data types. A query such as “List all the customers located within twenty
miles of company headquarters” will require the processing of spatial data types
typically outside the scope of standard relational algebra and may involve consult-
ing an external geographic database that maps the company headquarters and each
customer to a 2-D map based on their address. Effectively, each customer will be
associated to a <latitude, longitude> position. A traditional B*-tree index based on
customers’ zip codes or other nonspatial attributes cannot be used to process this
query since traditional indexes are not capable of ordering multidimensional coor-
dinate data. Therefore, there is a special need for databases tailored for handling
spatial data and spatial queries.

Table 26.1 shows the common analytical operations involved in processing geo-
graphic or spatial data.?> Measurement operations are used to measure some
global properties of single objects (such as the area, the relative size of an object’s
parts, compactness, or symmetry) and to measure the relative position of different
objects in terms of distance and direction. Spatial analysis operations, which often
use statistical techniques, are used to uncover spatial relationships within and
among mapped data layers. An example would be to create a map—known as a
prediction map—that identifies the locations of likely customers for particular
products based on the historical sales and demographic information. Flow analysis
operations help in determining the shortest path between two points and also the
connectivity among nodes or regions in a graph. Location analysis aims to find if
the given set of points and lines lie within a given polygon (location). The process
involves generating a buffer around existing geographic features and then identify-
ing or selecting features based on whether they fall inside or outside the boundary
of the buffer. Digital terrain analysis is used to build three-dimensional models,
