Data Structures and Applications (BCS304) Module IV

Krainpk:

e If we represent G by its adjacency list then we can determine the vertices adjacent to v by
following a chain of links. Since dfs examines each node in the adjacency list at most once
then the time to complete the search is O(e).

e If we represent G by its adjacency matrix then determining all vertices adjacent 0 v requires
O(n) time. Since we visit at most n vertices the total time is O(n7).

Example: For the graph given below if the search is initiated from vertex 0 then the vertices are
visited in the order vertex 3, 1,2
