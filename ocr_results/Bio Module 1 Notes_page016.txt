Lipase: An enzyme that breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. It is found in
the pancreas and small intestine.

Catalase: An enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It is
found in most cells of the body.

Trypsin: An enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. It is produced
in the pancreas and released into the small intestine.

ATP synthase: An enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of ATP (adenosine
triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate. It is found in the

mitochondria of cells.

2) Transporting molecules

Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that transports oxygen
from the lungs to the tissues in the body.

Albumin: Albumin is a protein found in blood plasma that helps transport various
substances such as hormones, fatty acids, and drugs throughout the body.
Transferrin: Transferrin is a protein that transports iron in the blood from the site of
absorption in the gut to the bone marrow, liver, and other tissues that require it.
Apolipoproteins: Apolipoproteins are a family of proteins that transport lipids (fats)
in the bloodstream. Examples include ApoA, ApoB, and ApoE.

Ferritin: Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in a non-toxic form in the liver, spleen,
and bone marrow.

Glut transporters: Glut transporters are a family of proteins that transport glucose and

other sugars across cell membranes. Examples include GLUT1 and GLUT4.

3) Providing mechanical support

Collagen: Collagen is the main structural protein in the body and provides support to
tissues such as skin, tendons, cartilage, bone, and teeth.

Elastin: Elastin is a protein that provides elasticity and stretchability to tissues such
as skin, lungs, arteries, and ligaments.

Keratin: Keratin is a protein that forms the structural basis of hair, nails, and the outer
layer of skin.

Actin and Myosin: Actin and myosin are proteins that are involved in muscle
contraction and provide the mechanical force required for movement.

Tubulin: Tubulin is a protein that forms the structural basis of microtubules, which
provide support to cells and are involved in various cellular processes such as cell

division and intracellular transport.
