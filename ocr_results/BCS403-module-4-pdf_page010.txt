1.1.8 Grouping: The GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses
Grouping is used to create subgroups of tuples before summarization. For example, we may want
to find the average salary of employees in each department or the number of employees who work
on each project. In these cases we need to partition the relation into. non overlapping subsets (or
groups) of tuples. Each group (partition) will consist of the tuples that have the same value of some
attribute(s), called the grouping attribute(s).
SQL has a GROUP BY clause for this purpose. The GROUP BY clause specifies the grouping
attributes, which should also appear in the SELECT clause, so that the value resulting from applying
each aggregate function to a group of tuples appears along with the value of the grouping
attribute(s).
Example: For each department, retrieve the department number, the number of employees in the
department, and their average salary.

SELECT Dno, COUNT (*), AVG (Salary)

FROM EMPLOYEE

GROUP BY Dno;

Grouping EMPLOYEE tuples by the value of Dno

If NULLs exist in the grouping attribute, then a separate group is created for all tuples with a NULL
value in the grouping attribute. For example, if the EMPLOYEE table had some tuples that had
NULL for the grouping attribute Dno, there would be a separate group for those tuples in the result
