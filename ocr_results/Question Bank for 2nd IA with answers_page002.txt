3. With a neat diagram of neuron explain the process of signal transmission.
Ans. Signal transmission in the brain occurs through the firing of nerve cells, or neurons. A neuron receives
inputs from other neurons at its dendrites, integrates the information, and then generates an electrical
impulse, or action potential, that travels down its axon to the synaptic terminals. At the synaptic terminals,
the neuron releases chemical neurotransmitters, which cross the synaptic gap and bind to receptors on the

postsynaptic neuron, leading to the initiation of another action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.

NEURON STRUCTURE

This process of transmitting information from one neuron to another is known as synaptic transmission and

forms the basis of communication within the brain. Different types of neurotransmitters have different
effects on postsynaptic neurons, and the balance of neurotransmitter levels can influence brain function,
including mood, learning, and memory. Signal transmission in the brain is also influenced by various forms
of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which can

modify the strength of synaptic connections and contribute to learning and memory processes.

4. Give an account on the structure and functioning of kidneys.
Ans. Architecture of Kidney
The kidney is composed of functional units called nephrons, which are the basic structural and functional
units of the kidney. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons, and each nephron performs

the functions of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.
