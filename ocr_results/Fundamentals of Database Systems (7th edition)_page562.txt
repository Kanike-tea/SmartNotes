Chapter 15 Relational Database Design Algorithms and Further Dependencies

As with other types of dependencies, there are inclusion dependency inference rules
(IDIRs). The following are three examples:

IDIR1 (reflexivity): R.X < R.X.

IDIR2 (attribute correspondence): If R.X < S.Y, where X = {A}, Ap, ... , An} and
Y = {B}, By, ... , B,} and A; corresponds to B;, then R.A; < S.B; for 1 <i<n.

IDIRS (transitivity): If R.X < $.Y and S.Y < T.Z, then R.X < T.Z.

The preceding inference rules were shown to be sound and complete for inclusion
dependencies. So far, no normal forms have been developed based on inclusion
dependencies.

15.6.3 Functional Dependencies Based on Arithmetic
Functions and Procedures

Sometimes some attributes in a relation may be related via some arithmetic func-
tion or a more complicated functional relationship. As long as a unique value of Y
is associated with every X, we can still consider that the FD X — Y exists. For exam-
ple, in the relation

ORDER_LINE (Order#, Item#, Quantity, Unit_price, Extended_price,
Discounted_price)

each tuple represents an item from an order with a particular quantity, and the
price per unit for that item. In this relation, (Quantity, Unit_price ) +> Extended_price
by the formula

Extended_price = Unit_price * Quantity

Hence, there is a unique value for Extended_price for every pair (Quantity, Unit_price),
and thus it conforms to the definition of functional dependency.

Moreover, there may be a procedure that takes into account the quantity discounts,
the type of item, and so on and computes a discounted price for the total quantity
ordered for that item. Therefore, we can say

(Item#, Quantity, Unit_price ) > Discounted_price, or
(Item#, Quantity, Extended_price) > Discounted_price

To check the above FDs, a more complex procedure COMPUTE_TOTAL_PRICE may
have to be called into play. Although the above kinds of FDs are technically present
in most relations, they are not given particular attention during normalization. They
may be relevant during the loading of relations and during query processing because
populating or retrieving the attribute on the right-hand side of the dependency
requires the execution of a procedure such as the one mentioned above.

15.6.4 Domain-Key Normal Form

There is no hard-and-fast rule about defining normal forms only up to 5NF. His-
torically, the process of normalization and the process of discovering undesirable
