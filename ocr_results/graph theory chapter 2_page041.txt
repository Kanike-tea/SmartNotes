We note that the graph G, is a path of length 4. Therefore, P(G, .a) = aa »
Also, the graph G, is the graph K3. Therefore, P(G,, a) = A(A = 1y(Q— ~2,
Accordingly, using the decomposition theorem, we find that ;
P(G, a) = P(G,, a) - P(G,, a) 03-6 wl des
= A(A- 1) - A= 1)(A-2) ~
=A 4462-32.

This is the chromati¢ polynomial for the given cycle.
