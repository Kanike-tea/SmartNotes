Overall, carbohydrates are essential components of biological systems and play a crucial role

in maintaining the health and survival of living organisms.

Properties and Functions of Carbohydrates
1. Properties of Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen
(O), usually in the ratio (CH2O)n. They exhibit the following properties:

A. Physical Properties

¢ Solubility: Simple carbohydrates (monosaccharides and disaccharides) are water-
soluble due to their hydroxyl (-OH) groups, whereas complex carbohydrates
(polysaccharides) are less soluble or insoluble.

¢ Taste: Monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose) and some disaccharides (e.g.,
sucrose) have a sweet taste, while polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose) are
tasteless.

¢ Crystallinity: Many monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) can form crystalline structures.

¢ Optical Activity: Carbohydrates can rotate plane-polarized light due to the presence of
chiral centers (D- and L- forms).

B. Chemical Properties

e Reducing Nature: Some carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, maltose) have free aldehyde or
ketone groups, making them reducing sugars (Benedict’s test and Fehling’s test).

¢ Hydrolysis: Disaccharides and polysaccharides break down into simpler sugars when
treated with acids or enzymes.

¢ Glycosidic Bond Formation: Monosaccharides link via glycosidic bonds to form
disaccharides and polysaccharides.

¢ Fermentation: Certain carbohydrates can undergo fermentation to produce alcohol and
CO: (e.g., yeast fermentation of glucose to ethanol).

Functions of Carbohydrates
A. Energy Source
¢ Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for living organisms.
¢ Glucose metabolism (glycolysis and cellular respiration) provides ATP for cellular
functions.
B. Energy Storage
¢ Plants store carbohydrates as starch (amylose & amylopectin).
e Animals store carbohydrates as glycogen in liver and muscles for quick energy
release.

C. Structural Role

¢ Cellulose is a key structural component of plant cell walls.
