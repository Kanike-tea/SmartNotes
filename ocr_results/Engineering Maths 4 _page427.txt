distribution of the sample mean, (a) ’ with replacement (b) without
replacement. Find the sample mean.and sample variance in thése two.cases. -

2. 500 ball bearings have a mean weight of 142.30 gms. and S.D.of 8.5 gms. Find the ~
probability that a random sample of 100 ball bearings chosen from this group will
have a combined weight (a) between 14,061 and 14,175 gms. (b) more than
14,460 gms. on - .

3. The weights of packages received by a department store have a mean of 136 kgs.
and aS.D of 22.5 kgs. What is the probability that 25 packages received at random
and loaded on an elevator will exceed the safety limit of the elevator quoted as
3720 kgs.

4. A‘die’ was thrown 9000 times and a throw of 5 or 6 was obtained 3240 times. On
the assumption of random throwing,.do the data indicate anunbiasséd die ?

5, Asample of 900 days is taken from meteorological records of a certain district and
100 of them are found tobe foggy. Find the 99.73% confidence level probable limits
of the percentage of foggy days in the district. « i “oe 8 g

8. A machine produced 20 defective units in a sample of 400. After over oiling the
machine it produced 10 defective in a batch of 300. Has the machine improved
due to over oiling ? “ga nos ae 7: ,

9.. Ten individuals are chosen at random from a population and ‘their heights in’
inches are found to be 63, 63, 64, 65, 66, 69, 69, 70, 70, 71, Discuss the suggestion
