nplementing F = (AB + A’B) (C + D’)

The AND-OR implementation of this function is shown in Fig. 3.21(a) with three
levels of gating. The conversion to NAND with mixed notation is presented in Fig.
3.21(b) of the diagram.

The two additional bubbles associated with inputs C and D' cause these two
literals to be complemented to C' and D.

The bubble in the output NAND gate complements the output value, so we need
to insert an inverter gate at the output in order to complement the signal again
and get the original value back.

NOR Implementation

>

The NOR operation is the dual of the NAND operation. Therefore, all
procedures and rules for NOR logic are the duals of the corresponding procedures
and rules developed for NAND logic.

The NOR gate is another universal gate that can be used to implement any
Boolean function. The implementation of the complement, OR, and AND
operations with NOR gates is shown in Fig. 3.22.

The complement operation is obtained from a one- input NOR gate that behaves
exactly like an inverter.The OR operation requires two NOR gates, and the AND
operation is obtained with a NOR gate that has inverters in each input.

The two graphic symbols for the mixed notation are shown in Fig. 3.23. The OR-
invert symbol defines the NOR operation as an OR followed by a complement. The
invert-AND symbol complements each input and then performs an AND
