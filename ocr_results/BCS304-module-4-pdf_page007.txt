Binary tree representation of forest
4.3.2 Forest Traversal

Preorder Traversal:

The preorder traversal of T is equivalent to visiting the nodes of Fin wee preorder. We define

this as:

1. If F is empty, then return.

2. Visit the root of the first tree of F.

3. Traverse the subtrees of the first tree in tree preorder.
4. Traverse the remaining trees of F in preorder.

Inorder Traversal:

Inorder traversal of T is equivalent to visiting the nodes of F in tree inorder, which is defined

as:

1. If F is empty, then return.
2. Traverse the subtrees of the first tree in tree inorder.

3. Visit the root of the first tree.
4. Traverse the remaining trees in tree inorder.

Postorder Traversal:

There is no natural analog for the postorder traversal of the corresponding binary tree ofa

forest. Nevertheless, we can define the postorder traversal of a forest, F, as:

If F is empty, then return.
Traverse the subtrees of the first tree of F in tree postorder.

Traverse the remaining trees of F in tree postorder.
