1. Statement If f(z) isanalyticinaregion R and if P and Q areany two points in
Q : : Q

it then j £(2) dz is independent of the path Joining P and Q. That is i f(2) dz is
P P

same for all curves joining P and Q.

Proof: Let C, and C, be two simple curves joining P and Q such that both the

curves liein the region R. Then their union PAQBP asin the following figure below
becomes a simple closed curve C in the region R.

This implies that: f-f(zy dz = fiz) de.
2, Statement: If C,, C, are two simple closed curves such that Cy, lies entirely within
Cy and if f(z) is analytic on C,, C, and in the region bounded by C,, C, (known as
