Options for mapping specialization or generalization. (a) Mapping the EER schema in Figure 4.4 using option 8A.
(b) Mapping the EER schema in Figure 4.3(b) using option 8B. (c) Mapping the EER schema in Figure 4.4 using
option 8C. (d) Mapping Figure 4.5 using option 8D with Boolean type fields Mflag and Pflag.

inherited attributes from the superclass C stored redundantly in more than one table L;.
With option 8B, no relation holds all the entities in the superclass C; consequently, we
must apply an OUTER UNION (or FULL OUTER JOIN) operation (see Section 6.4) to the L;
relations to retrieve all the entities in C. The result of the outer union will be similar to
the relations under options 8C and 8D except that the type fields will be missing. When-
ever we search for an arbitrary entity in C, we must search all the m relations L;.

Options 8C and 8D create a single relation to represent the superclass C and all its
subclasses. An entity that does not belong to some of the subclasses will have NULL
values for the specific (local) attributes of these subclasses. These options are not
recommended if many specific attributes are defined for the subclasses. If few local
subclass attributes exist, however, these mappings are preferable to options 8A
and 8B because they do away with the need to specify JOIN operations; therefore,
they can yield a more efficient implementation for queries.

Option 8C is used to handle disjoint subclasses by including a single type (or image
or discriminating) attribute ¢ to indicate to which of the m subclasses each tuple
belongs; hence, the domain of t could be {1, 2, ... , m}. If the specialization is partial, t
can have NULL values in tuples that do not belong to any subclass. If the specialization
is attribute-defined, that attribute itself serves the purpose of t and f is not needed; this
option is illustrated in Figure 9.5(c) for the EER specialization in Figure 4.4.

Option 8D is designed to handle overlapping subclasses by including m Boolean
type (or flag) fields, one for each subclass. It can also be used for disjoint subclasses.
