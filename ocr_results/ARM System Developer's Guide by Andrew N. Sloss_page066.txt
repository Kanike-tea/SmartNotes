3.1 Data Processing Instructions 53.

Table 3.3 Barrel shift operation syntax for data processing instructions.

N shift operations Syntax

Immediate #immediate

Register Rm

Logical shift left by immediate Rm, LSL #shift_imm
Logical shift left by register Rm, LSL Rs

Logical shift right by immediate Rm, LSR #shift_imm
Logical shift right with register Rm, LSR Rs
Arithmetic shift right by immediate Rm, ASR #shift_imm
Arithmetic shift right by register Rm, ASR Rs

Rotate right by immediate Rm, ROR #shift_imm
Rotate right by register Rm, ROR Rs

Rotate right with extend Rm, RRX

Exampce This example of a MOVS instruction shifts register r/ left by one bit. This multiplies register
3.3. rl bya value 2!. As you can see, the C flag is updated in the cpsr because the S suffix is
present in the instruction mnemonic.

PRE —cpsr = nzcvqiFt_USER
r0 = 0x00000000
rl = 0x80000004

MOVS 0, rl, LSL #1

POST cpsr = nzCvqiFt_USER
r0 = 0x00000008
rl = 0x80000004

Table 3.3 lists the syntax for the different barrel shift operations available on data
processing instructions. The second operand N can be an immediate constant preceded by
#,a register value Rm, or the value of Rm processed by a shift.

3.1.3 ARITHMETIC INSTRUCTIONS

The arithmetic instructions implement addition and subtraction of 32-bit signed and
unsigned values.
