Concrete cracks

‘Water and oxygen enter the crack

Bacteria become activated

Activated bacteria produce calcium carbonate

Calcium carbonate fills in the cracks

Concrete is repaired and structural integrity is restored

Self-healing bio-concrete works by incorporating Bacillus bacteria into the concrete mixture,
along with calcium lactate as a nutrient source. The bacteria are dormant within the concrete and
do not become active until the concrete cracks. When the concrete cracks, water and oxygen
enter the crack and activate the Bacillus bacteria. The bacteria then produce calcium carbonate,
which is a type of mineral that is commonly found in natural stone. The calcium carbonate acts
as a binder and fills in the cracks, repairing the concrete and restoring its structural integrity.
This process is known as biomineralization.

The Bacillus bacteria used in self-healing bioconcrete are naturally occurring and non- toxic,
so they are considered to be environmentally friendly. They are also able to survive in a wide
range of temperatures and pH levels, making them well-suited for use in concrete. In addition
to repairing cracks, self-healing bioconcrete also has the potential to improve the overall
durability of concrete by reducing the amount of water that is able to penetrate the surface. This
can help to prevent the development of further cracks and increase the longevity of the concrete.

7. What is Bioremediation & Biomining? Explain the various types of bioremediation.

Ans. Bioremediation and biomining are two related but distinct processes that utilize living
organisms to clean up contaminated environments or extract valuable minerals, respectively.

Bioremediation refers to the use of microorganisms, plants, or animals to clean up
contaminated environments, such as soil, water, or air. This process occurs naturally over time,
but can also be accelerated through the addition of specific microorganisms or other biotic
agents. The goal of bioremediation is to remove contaminants from the environment and restore
it to a healthy state.

Biomining, on the other hand, refers to the use of microorganisms to extract valuable minerals
from ore deposits. This process involves the use of microorganisms to dissolve minerals from
ore, creating a solution that can be separated and purified to obtain the valuable minerals.
Biomining is often used in the extraction of metals such as copper, gold, and nickel, and has
several advantages over traditional mining methods, including lower energy costs, reduced
waste, and increased metal recovery.
