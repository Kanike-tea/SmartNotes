20.24. Consider schedules $3, S4, and S; below. Determine whether each schedule is
strict, cascadeless, recoverable, or nonrecoverable. (Determine the strictest
recoverability condition that each schedule satisfies.)

Selected Bibliography

The concept of serializability and related ideas to maintain consistency in a data-
base were introduced in Gray et al. (1975). The concept of the database transaction
was first discussed in Gray (1981). Gray won the coveted ACM Turing Award in
1998 for his work on database transactions and implementation of transactions in
relational DBMSs. Bernstein, Hadzilacos, and Goodman (1988) focus on concur-
rency control and recovery techniques in both centralized and distributed database
systems; it is an excellent reference. Papadimitriou (1986) offers a more theoretical
perspective. A large reference book of more than a thousand pages by Gray and
Reuter (1993) offers a more practical perspective of transaction processing concepts
and techniques. Elmagarmid (1992) offers collections of research papers on trans-
action processing for advanced applications. Transaction support in SQL is
described in Date and Darwen (1997). View serializability is defined in Yannakakis
(1984). Recoverability of schedules and reliability in databases is discussed in
Hadzilacos (1983, 1988). Buffer replacement policies are discussed in Chou and
DeWitt (1985). Snapshot isolation is discussed in Ports and Grittner (2012).
