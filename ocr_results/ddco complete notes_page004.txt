THEOREM 6(b): x(x + y) = x by duality.

> The theorems of Boolean algebra can be proven by means of truth tables.

> In truth tables, both sides of the relation are checked to see whether they yield
identical results for all possible combinations of the variables involved.

> The following truth table verifies the first absorption theorem:

o/lo o| o

1/0 0 1

The truth table for the first DeMorgan’s theorem, (x + y)' = x'y', is as follows:

x y(xty| (x+y) x' | y' | xy’
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1/0] 0
1 0} 1 0 0} 1 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 0

The operator precedence for evaluating Boolean expressions is
(1) parentheses, (2) NOT, (3) AND, and (4) OR
BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS

> Boolean algebra is an algebra that deals with binary variables and logic
operations.

> A Boolean function described by an algebraic expression consists of binary
variables, the constants 0 and 1, and the logic operation symbols.

> For a given value of the binary variables, the function can be equal to either 1 or
0.

Consider the Boolean function F1 = x + y'z The function F1 is equal to 1 if x is equal
to 1 or if both y' and z are equal to 1. F1 is equal to 0 otherwise. Therefore, F1 = 1 if x
= lorify=Oandz=1.
