Complement of a Simple graph

Earlier, we have noted that every simple graph of order n is a subgraph of the complete
graph K,. If G is a simple graph of order n, then the complement of G in K,, is called the
complement of G; it is denoted by G.

Thus, the complement G of a simple graph G with n vertices is that graph which is obtained
by deleting those edges in K, which belong to G. Thus, G = K,-G=K,AG.

Evidently, K,, G and G have the same vertex set, and two vertices are adjacent in G if and
only if they are not adjacent in G. Obviously, G is also a simple graph and the complement of
Gis G; that is G = G. Itis equally obvious that the complement of K,, is the null graph of order
_ nand vice-versa.

In Figure 1.83(a), the complete graph Ky is shown. A simple graph G of order 4 is shown
in Figure 1.83(b). The complement, G, of G is shown in Figure 1.83(c). Observe that G, G
and K; have the same vertices and that the edges in G are got by deleting those edges from K4
which belong to G.

In Figure 1.84(a), a graph G of order 6 is shown as a subgraph of Kg, the edges of G being
own in thick lines. Its complement, G, is shown in Figure 1.84(b). The graph shown in
igure 1.84(b) is known as the David graph.
