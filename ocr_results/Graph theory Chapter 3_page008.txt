32. Rooted Trees

, Let T be a tree with n vertices,
, is a path i P where n > 4, and v be a.vertex f maxi i
that 7 is a path if and only if d(v) = 2, of maximum degree in 7. Prove

41. Let T be a tree with n vertices, n > 3, Show

that there j : ie
such that every vertex adjacent to Vekiepe 1S a vertex v of T with degree at least two

Possibly One, is a pendant vertex.

12. (a) Let Fi = (Vi, E)) be a forest of seven trees where |E\| = 40, Wh tis |Vj|?
= 40. at is |V;

(b) If F2 = (V2, Ez) is a forest with |V>| = 62 and |E2| = 51, how many trees determine Fy?

Ans: (a) 47 (b) 11.

3.2 Rooted Trees

Let Dbe a gece graph ei G be its underlying graph. We say that D is a directed tree
whenever G is a tree. Thus, a directed tree is a directed graph whose underlying graph is a tree.
(a directed tree T is called a rooted tree if (i) T contains a unique vertex, called the root,
whose in-degree is equal to 0, and il) the in-degrees of all other vertices of T are equal to 1,
Figures 3.5 and 3.6 depict two directed trees. The first of these is not a rooted tree whereas

the second is a'rooted tree. . Y >

0 upper level to a lower level, so that the arrows can be dropped. Then the root r will be at the
“Dpermost level (zeroth level) and all other vertices will be at lower levels.

A vertex v (other than the root r) of a rooted tree is said to be at the k-th level or has level
