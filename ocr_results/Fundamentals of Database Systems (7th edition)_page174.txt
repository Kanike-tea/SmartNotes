Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

4.29.

each course he or she teaches, the instructor specifies the minimum number
of points required in order to earn letter grades A, B, C, D, and F. For exam-
ple, 90 points for an A, 80 points for a B, 70 points for a C, and so forth.

= Students are enrolled in each course taught by the instructor.

= Each course has a number of grading components (such as midterm

exam, final exam, project, and so forth). Each grading component has a
maximum number of points (such as 100 or 50) and a weight (such as
20% or 10%). The weights of all the grading components of a course usu-
ally total 100.

Finally, the instructor records the points earned by each student in each of
the grading components in each of the courses. For example, student 1234
earns 84 points for the midterm exam grading component of the section 2
course CSc2310 in the fall term of 2009. The midterm exam grading com-
ponent may have been defined to have a maximum of 100 points and a
weight of 20% of the course grade.

Design an enhanced entity-relationship diagram for the grade book data-
base and build the design using a data modeling tool such as ERwin or
Rational Rose.

Consider an ONLINE_AUCTION database system in which members (buyers
and sellers) participate in the sale of items. The data requirements for this
system are summarized as follows:

The online site has members, each of whom is identified by a unique
member number and is described by an e-mail address, name, password,
home address, and phone number.

A member may be a buyer or a seller. A buyer has a shipping address
recorded in the database. A seller has a bank account number and routing
number recorded in the database.

Items are placed by a seller for sale and are identified by a unique item
number assigned by the system. Items are also described by an item title,
a description, starting bid price, bidding increment, the start date of the
auction, and the end date of the auction.

Items are also categorized based on a fixed classification hierarchy (for
example, a modem may be classified as COMPUTER > HARDWARE >
MODEM).

Buyers make bids for items they are interested in. Bid price and time of
bid are recorded. The bidder at the end of the auction with the highest bid
price is declared the winner, and a transaction between buyer and seller
may then proceed.

The buyer and seller may record feedback regarding their completed
transactions. Feedback contains a rating of the other party participating
in the transaction (1-10) and a comment.
