”<95% aonfidence interval for pe: x + 1,96( o/Vn )
99% confidence interval for 1 : x + 2.58(0/Vn )
1.96 and 2.58 are respectively the 95% and 99% confidence coefficients. . °

> — Test of significance of proportions

Let x be the observed number of successes ina sample sizeof ad p= np bethe
expected number of successes. The associated s-n-v is given by,

x-H ox-n

where p is the probability of success and q is the probability of failure.

If |z| > 258 we conclude that the difference is highly significant and reject ‘the .

hypothesis at 1% level of significance.

p + 258 Vpq/n are the probable limits at 99% confidence level.

Also p +3 \pq/n are the probable limits at 99.73% confidence level.

> Test of significance for difference of means

Let 1, 1, be the mean of two popilations.

Let (x XO) (x, 1 05) be the mean and S.D of two large samples of size n, and
Ny serpaiedl To test the null hypothesis Hy : py = Hy the statistic is ae by ;

_ 4-%
Vo4/ n+ o/ ny
Also the confidence limits for the difference of means of the population are

(%~%) £2, Vo2/n, + 09/1,

where z, is the confidence coefficient.

> Test of significance for difference of properites (attributes ) - two samples
Let p, and p, be the sample proportions in respect of an attribute corresponding to

2 large samples of size n, and 1, drawn from two populations. To test the null- . . :
hypothesis Hy that there is no difference between the population with regard tothe

attribute, the statistic is given by
