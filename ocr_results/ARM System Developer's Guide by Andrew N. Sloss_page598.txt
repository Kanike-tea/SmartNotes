Table A.6 LDM addressing modes.

‘Addressing Lowest address Highest address Value written back
mode accessed accessed to Rnif | specified
{IA|FD} Rn Rn + N*4 - 4 Rn + N*4
{IB|ED} Rn + 4 Rn + N*4. Rn + N*4
{DA|FA} Rn - N*4 + 4 Rn Rn - N*4
{DB|EA} Rn - N*4 Rn - 4 Rn - N*4

N= the number of registers in <register_list>
start = the lowest address accessed given in Table A.6
for (i=0; i<N; itt)
<register_list>[i] = memory(start+i*4, 4);
if (! specified) then update Rn according to Table A.6

Note that memory(a, 4) returns the four bytes at address a packed according to the
current processor data endianness. If a is not a multiple of four, then the load is unaligned.
Because the behavior of an unaligned load depends on the architecture revision, memory
system, and system coprocessor (CP15) configuration, it’s best to avoid unaligned loads if
possible. Assuming that the external memory system does not abort unaligned loads, then
the following rules usually apply:

= Ifthe core has a system coprocessor and bit 1 (A-bit) or bit 22 (U-bit) of CP15:cl:c0:0
is set, then unaligned load multiples cause an alignment fault data abort exception.

= Otherwise the access ignores the bottom two address bits.

Table A.6 lists the possible addressing modes specified by <amode>. If you specify the !,
then the base address register is updated according to Table A.6; otherwise it is preserved.
Note that the lowest register number is always read from the lowest address.

The first half of the addressing mode mnemonics stands for Increment After, Increment
Before, Decrement After, and Decrement Before, respectively. Increment modes load
the registers sequentially forward, starting from address Rn (increment after) or Rn + 4
(increment before). Decrement modes have the same effect as if you loaded the regis-
ter list backwards from sequentially descending memory addresses, starting from address
Rn (decrement after) or Rn — 4 (decrement before).

‘The second half of the addressing mode mnemonics stands for the stack type you can
implement with that address mode: Full Descending, Empty Descending, Full Ascending,
and Empty Ascending, With a full stack, Rn points to the last stacked value; with an empty
stack, Rn points to the first unused stack location. ARM stacks are usually full descending.
