give the exact definition of the combinational circuit. It is important that the verbal specifications be
interpreted correctly in the truth table, as they are often incomplete, and any wrong interpretation may
result in an incorrect truth table.

[he output binary functions listed in the truth table are simplified by any available method, such as
algebraic manipulation, the map method, or a computer-based simplification program. Frequently, there
is a variety of simplified expressions from which to choose. In a particular application, certain criteria
will serve as a guide in the process of choosing an implementation. A practical design must consider
such constraints as the number of gates, number of inputs to a gate, propagation time of the signal
through the gates, number of interconnections, limitations of the driving capability of each gate (i.e., the
number of gates to which the output of the circuit may be connected), and various other criteria that must
be taken into consideration when designing integrated circuits.

Example: Consider the BCD to Excess-3 code conversion.

[he bit combinations assigned to the BCD and excess-3 codes are listed in Table below

Since each code uses four bits to represent a decimal digit, there must be four input variables and four
output variables. We designate the four input binary variables by the symbols A, B, C, and D, and the
four output variables by w, x, y , and z. The truth table relating the input and output variables is shown
in Table above. Note that four binary variables may have 16 bit combinations, but only 10 are listed in
the truth table. The six bit combinations not listed for the input variables are don’t-care combinations.
These values have no meaning in BCD and we assume that they will never occur in actual operation of
the circuit.

The maps in Fig. 4.3 are plotted to obtain simplified Boolean functions for the outputs. Each one of the
four maps represents one of the four outputs of the circuit as a function of the four input variables. The
1’s marked inside the squares are obtained from the minterms that make the output equal to 1. The 1’s
are obtained from the truth table by going over the output columns one at a time. For example, the
column under output z has five 1’s; therefore, the map for z has five 1’s, each being in a square
corresponding to the minterm that makes z equal to 1. The six don’t-care minterms 10 through 15 are
marked with an X. Following are the expressions obtained using K map.
z=D'

y=CD+C'D'=CD+(C+D)'
x = B'C + B'D + BC'D' = B'(C + D) + BC'D'

= B'(C+ D) + B(C+D)'
w=A+BC+BD=A+B(C+D)
