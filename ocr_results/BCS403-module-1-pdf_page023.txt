Database Management System [BCS403]

1. Méni-Based interfaces for Web Clients or Browsing: These interfaces present
the user with lists of options (called menus) that lead the user through the formulation
ofa request. There is no need for the user to memorize the specific commands and
syntax of a query language. Pull-down menus are a very popular technique in Web-
based user interfaces.

2. Pormis"Based interfaces: A forms-based interface displays a form to each user. Users can
fill out all of the form entries to insert new data, or they can fill out only certain entries, in
which case the DBMS will retrieve matching data for the remaining
entries. Forms are usually designed and programmed for naive users as interfaces to canned
transactions.

3. Graphical) User interfaces: A GUI typically displays a schema to the user in
diagrammatic form. The user then can specify a query by manipulating the diagram. In
many cases, GUIs utilize both menus and forms. Most GUIs use a pointing device,
such as a mouse, to select certain parts of the displayed schema diagram.

4. Natiralangiage Interfaces: These interfaces accept requests written in
English or some other language.and attempt to understand them. A natural language
interface usually has its own schema, which is similar to the database conceptual schema,
as well as a dictionary of important words. The natural language interface refers to the
words in its schema, as well as to the set of standard words in its dictionary, to interpret the
request. If the interpretation is successful, the interface generates a high-level query
corresponding to the natural language request and submits it to the DBMS for processing;
otherwise, a dialogue is started with the user
to clarify the request.

5. Speéchnputand/Output: Applications with limited vocabularies such as inquiries for
telephone directory, flight arrival/departure, and credit card account information are
allowing speech for input and output to enable customers to access this information. The
speech input is detected using a library of predefined words and used to set up the
parameters that are supplied to the queries. For output, a similar conversion from text or
numbers into speech takes place.

6. titerfaces for Parametric Users: Parametric users, such as bank tellers, often
have a small set of operations that they must perform repeatedly. For example, a
teller is able to use single function keys to invoke routine and repetitive transactions
such as account deposits or withdrawals, or balance inquiries. Usually a small set of

abbreviated commands is included, with the goal of minimizing the number of
