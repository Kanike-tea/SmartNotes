Database Management System [BCS403]

= Similarly, any transaction 72 that may have used a value written by 71 must also be rolled
back, and so on. This effect is known as cascading rollback and is one of the problems
associated with basic TO, since the schedules produced are not guaranteed to be
recoverable.
= An additional protocol must be enforced to ensure that the schedules are recoverable,
cascadeless, or strict.
= The basic TO algorithm :
= The concurrency control algorithm must check whether conflicting operations violate
the timestamp ordering in the following two cases:
1. Whenever a transaction T issues a write_item(X) operation, the following is
checked:

a. If read_TS(X) > TS(7) or if write_TS(X) > TS(7), then abort and roll back T and
reject the operation. This should be done because some younger transaction
with a timestamp greater than TS(7)—and hence after T in the timestamp
ordering—has already read or written the value of item X before T had a chance
to write X, thus violating the timestamp ordering.

b.If the condition in part (a) does not occur, then execute the write_item(X)
operation of T and set write_TS(X) to TS(7).

2. Whenever a transaction T issues a read_item(X) operation, the following is checked:
a. If write_TS(X) > TS(7), then abort and roll back T and reject the operation. This
should be done because some younger transaction with timestamp greater than
TS(T}—and hence after T in the timestamp ordering—has already written the
value of item X before T had a chance to read X.

b. If write_TS(X) s TS(T), then execute the read_item(X) operation of T and set
tead_TS(X) to the /arger of TS(T) and the current read_TS(X).

= Whenever the basic TO algorithm detects two conflicting operations that occur in
the incorrect order, it rejects the later of the two operations by aborting the
transaction that issued it. The schedules produced by basic TO are hence
guaranteed to be conflict serializable

Strict Timestamp Ordering (TO)
= A variation of basic TO called strict TO ensures that the schedules are both strict

(for easy recoverability) and (conflict) serializable.
