Reisner (1977) describes a human factors evaluation of SEQUEL, a precursor of
SQL, in which she found that users have some difficulty with specifying join condi-
tions and grouping correctly. Date (1984) contains a critique of the SQL language
that points out its strengths and shortcomings. Date and Darwen (1993) describes
SQL2. ANSI (1986) outlines the original SQL standard. Various vendor manuals
describe the characteristics of SQL as implemented on DB2, SQL/DS, Oracle,
INGRES, Informix, and other commercial DBMS products. Melton and Simon
(1993) give a comprehensive treatment of the ANSI 1992 standard called SQL2.
Horowitz (1992) discusses some of the problems related to referential integrity and
propagation of updates in SQL2.

The question of view updates is addressed by Dayal and Bernstein (1978), Keller
(1982), and Langerak (1990), among others. View implementation is discussed in
Blakeley et al. (1989). Negri et al. (1991) describes formal semantics of SQL queries.

There are many books that describe various aspects of SQL. For example, two refer-
ences that describe SQL-99 are Melton and Simon (2002) and Melton (2003). Fur-
ther SQL standards—SQL 2006 and SQL 2008—are described in a variety of
technical reports; but no standard references exist.
