Total time = Tiga x 105 = 0.098 x 10-® s = 98 ns

= 0.038 x 107"

Latency = 38 ns

(133 x 108)
(b) It takes twice as long to transfer 64 bytes, because two independent 32-byte transfers have to be
made. The latency is the same, i.e. 38 ns.

Problem 2:
Give a critique of the following statement: “Using a faster processor chip results in a corresponding
increase in performance of a computer even if the main-memory speed remains the same.”
Solution:
A faster processor chip will result in increased performance, but the amount of increase will not be
directly proportional to the increase in processor speed, because the cache miss penalty will remain the
same if the main-memory speed is not improved.

Problem 3:
A block-set-associative cache consists of a total of 64 blocks, divided into 4-block sets. The main- memory
contains 4096 blocks, each consisting of 32 words. Assuming a 32-bit byte-addressable address-space,
(a) how many bits are there in main-memory address
(b) how many bits are there in each of the Tag, Set, and Word fields?
Solution:
(a) 4096 blocks of 128 words each require 12+7 = 19 bits for the main-memory address.
(b) TAG field is 8 bits. SET field is 4 bits. WORD field is 7 bits.

Problem 5:
The cache block size in many computers is in the range of 32 to 128 bytes. What would be the main
advantages and disadvantages of making the size of cache blocks larger or smaller?
Solution:
Larger size
> Fewer misses if most of the data in the block are actually used
> Wasteful if much of the data are not used before the cache block is ejected from the
cache Smaller size
> More misses
Problem 4:
Consider a computer system in which the available pages in the physical memory are divided among several
application programs. The operating system monitors the page transfer activity and dynamically adjusts the
number of pages allocated to various programs. Suggest a suitable strategy that the operating system can use to
minimize the overall rate of page transfers.
Solution:
The operating system may increase the main-memory pages allocated to a program that has a large
number of page faults, using space previously allocated to a program with a few page faults

Problem 5:
In a computer with a virtual-memory system, the execution of an instruction may be interrupted by a page
fault. What state information has to be saved so that this instruction can be resumed later? Note that bringing a
new page into the main-memory involves a DMA transfer, which requires execution of other instructions. Is it
simpler to abandon the interrupted instruction and completely re-execute it later? Can this be done?
Solution:
Continuing the execution of an instruction interrupted by a page fault requires saving the entire state of
the processor, which includes saving all registers that may have been affected by the instruction as
