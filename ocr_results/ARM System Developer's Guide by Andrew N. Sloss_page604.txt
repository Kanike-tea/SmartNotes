A.3 Alphabetical List of ARM and Thumb Instructions 591

=~ Rdand Rm must be different registers.

= Implementations may terminate early on the value of the Rs operand. For this reason
use small or constant values for Rs where possible. See Appendix D.

= If the cpsr is updated, then N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>, C is unpredictable, and V
is preserved. Avoid using the instruction MLAS because implementations often impose
penalty cycles for this operation. Instead use MLA followed by a compare, and schedule
the compare to avoid multiply result use interlocks.

MOV Move a 32-bit value into a register

1. MOV<cond>{S} Rd, #<rotated_immed> ARMV1
2. MOV<cond>{$} Rd, Rm {, <shift>} ARMV1
3. MOV Ld, #<immed8> THUMBv1
4. MOV Ld, Ln THUMBv1
5. MOV Hd, Lm THUMBv1
6. MOV Ld, Hm THUMBv1
7. MOV Hd, Hm THUMBv1
Action Effect on the cpsr
1. Rd = <rotated_immed> Updated if S suffix specified
2. Rd = <shifted_Rm> Updated if S suffix specified
3. Ld = <immed8> Updated (see Notes below)
4. Ld = Ln Updated (see Notes below)
5. Hd = Lm Preserved
6. Ld = Hm Preserved
7. Hd = Hm Preserved
Notes

= = If the operation updates the cpsr and Rd is not pe, then N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>,
C= <shifter_C> (see Table A.3), and Vis preserved.

= If Rd or Hd is pc, then the instruction effects a jump to the calculated address. If the

operation updates the cpsr, then the processor mode must have an spsr; in this case, the
cpsr is set to the value of the spsr.
