MODULE 3
MEMORY SYSTEM

BASIC CONCEPTS

* Maximum size of memory that can be used in any computer is determined by addressing mode.

Address Memory Locations
16 Bit 2°=64K

32 Bit 27 = 4G Giga)

40 Bit 2 =TT (Tera)

© If MAR is k-bits long then

Processor-memory interface

Memory

k-bit address

n-bit data

Up to 2* addressable
locations

Word length = n bits

Figure 8.1 Connection of the memory to the processor.

¢ Memory may contain upto 2K addressable-locations
© If MDR is n-bits long, then
— n-bits of data are transferred between the memory and processor.
© The data-transfer takes place over the processor-bus (Figure 8.1).
© The processor-bus has
1) Address-Line
2) Data-line &
3) Control-Line (R/W“, MFC — Memory Function Completed).
© The Control-Line is used for coordinating data-transfer.
© The processor reads the data from the memory by
— loading the address of the required memory-location into MAR and
— setting the R/W“ line to 1.
© The memory responds by
— placing the data from the addressed-location onto the data-lines and
— confirms this action by asserting MFC signal.
© Upon receipt of MFC signal, the processor loads the data from the data-lines into MDR.
© The processor writes the data into the memory-location by
— loading the address of this location into MAR &
— setting the R/W“ line to 0.
* Memory Access Time: It is the time that elapses between
— initiation of an operation &
— completion of that operation.
