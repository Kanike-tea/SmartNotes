DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

* On successful resizing, it returns a pointer to the start of the new block. On failure, it returns
the value NULL.
* To create clean and readable programs, the REALLOC macro can be created as shown

below:

#define REALLOC (p,s)

if ((p=realloc(p,s) )==NULL)

{
printf ("insufficient memory");
exit (0);

STRUCTURES AND UNIONS

Structures

Arrays are collections of data of the same type. In C there is an alternate way of grouping data
that permits the data to vary in type. This mechanism is called the»struct, short for structure. A
structure (called a record in many other programming languages) is a collection of data items,
where each item is identified as to its type and name.

struct {
char name[10];
int age;
float salary;
} person;

> Creates a variable whose name is person and that has three fields:
e aname that is a character array
e an integer value representing the age of the person
e afloat value representing the salary of the individual

> Dot operator(.) is used to access a particular member of the structure.

strepy (person.name, "james")
person. age
person.salary = 35000;

> We can create our own structure data types by using the typedef statement as below:

typedef struct human— typedef struct {
being { char name[10];

char name[10]; int age;

int age; -OR- float salary;

float salary; } human-being;
