17.1.4 Summary

To conclude this section, we summarize the discussion of index types in two tables.
Table 17.1 shows the index field characteristics of each type of ordered single-level
index discussed—primary, clustering, and secondary. Table 17.2 summarizes the
properties of each type of index by comparing the number of index entries and
specifying which indexes are dense and which use block anchors of the data file.
