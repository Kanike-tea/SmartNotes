Reception of echoes: The transducer in the ultrasonography machine receives the echoes
and sends the information to a computer, which processes the data to create images.

Image formation: The computer uses the information from the echoes to create images of
the internal organs and tissues of the body. The images are displayed on a screen,
allowing the operator to see the structure and movement of the internal organs and
tissues.

Advantages of Ultrasonography

Non-invasive: Ultrasonography does not involve any incisions or injections, making it a
safe and convenient imaging method.

No ionizing radiation: Ultrasonography does not use ionizing radiation, making it a safer
option for patients, especially pregnant women and children.

Real-time imaging: Ultrasonography provides real-time images that can be used to
monitor the movement and function of internal organs and tissues in real-time.

Portable: Ultrasonography machines are portable and can be used in a variety of settings,
making it a valuable tool for emergency and rural medicine.

Cost-effective: Ultrasonography is a cost-effective imaging method that does not require
any special preparation or recovery time.

Versatile: Ultrasonography can be used to image a wide range of structures within the
body, including the organs of the abdomen, pelvis, and chest, as well as the uterus, fetus,
and other soft tissues.

Limitations of Ultrasonography

Limited depth: Ultrasonography has limited depth and is not as effective at imaging deep
structures or those obscured by bones or gas.

Operator dependence: The quality of the images produced by ultrasonography depends
heavily on the skills and experience of the operator.

Limited resolution: Ultrasonography has limited resolution compared to other imaging
methods, making it less effective at visualizing small structures or detecting small
changes in tissue.

Limitations in overweight patients: Ultrasonography may have limited usefulness in
overweight patients due to the difficulty in obtaining clear images through the layers of
fat.

Limitations in detecting some types of cancer: Ultrasonography may not be as effective at
detecting certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, due to the lack of
characteristic signs on ultrasound images.

4.1.2 Sonars

Sonar, which stands for Sound Navigation and Ranging, is a technology that uses sound

waves to detect and locate underwater objects.
