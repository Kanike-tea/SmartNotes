Overall, the design of stents plays an important role in their effectiveness and safety. Stents
must be designed to provide adequate support to the blood vessel, prevent restenosis, and
minimize the risk of complications such as blood clots.

Pace Makers

A pacemaker is a small device that is surgically implanted in the chest to regulate the heartbeat.
It is used to treat heart rhythm disorders, such as bradycardia (a slow heartbeat) or arrhythmias
(abnormal heart rhythms), by delivering electrical impulses to the heart to regulate its rhythm.

Figure: Representing components of a pacemaker

The basic design of a pacemaker consists of:

O Generator: The generator is the main component of the pacemaker and contains a battery
and electronic circuitry to generate and control the electrical impulses.

UO Leads: Leads are thin wires that connect the generator to the heart and carry the electrical
mpulses from the generator to the heart.

UO Electrodes: The electrodes are located at the end of the leads and are used to deliver the

electrical impulses to the heart.

Pacemakers can be designed to work in different ways, including:

] Single-chamber pacemaker: A single-chamber pacemaker delivers electrical impulses to
ither the right atrium or the right ventricle of the heart to regulate its rhythm.

Q Dual-chamber pacemaker: A dual-chamber pacemaker delivers electrical impulses to both
he right atrium and the right ventricle of the heart to regulate its rhythm.

) Biventricular pacemaker: A biventricular pacemaker delivers electrical impulses to both
ventricles of the heart to coordinate their contractions and improve heart function in people

with heart failure.
