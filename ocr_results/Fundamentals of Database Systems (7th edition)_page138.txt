Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

concept of category in the EER model. Section 4.5 gives a sample UNIVERSITY
database schema in the EER model and summarizes the EER model concepts by
giving formal definitions. We will use the terms object and entity interchangeably
in this chapter, because many of these concepts are commonly used in object-
oriented models.

We present the UML class diagram notation for representing specialization and
generalization in Section 4.6, and we briefly compare these with EER notation and
concepts. This serves as an example of alternative notation, and is a continuation
of Section 3.8, which presented basic UML class diagram notation that corre-
sponds to the basic ER model. In Section 4.7, we discuss the fundamental abstrac-
tions that are used as the basis of many semantic data models. Section 4.8
summarizes the chapter.

For a detailed introduction to conceptual modeling, Chapter 4 should be consid-
ered a continuation of Chapter 3. However, if only a basic introduction to ER mod-
eling is desired, this chapter may be omitted. Alternatively, the reader may choose
to skip some or all of the later sections of this chapter (Sections 4.4 through 4.8).

4.1 Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance

The EER model includes all the modeling concepts of the ER model that were pre-
sented in Chapter 3. In addition, it includes the concepts of subclass and superclass
and the related concepts of specialization and generalization (see Sections 4.2
and 4.3). Another concept included in the EER model is that of a category or union
type (see Section 4.4), which is used to represent a collection of objects (entities)
that is the union of objects of different entity types. Associated with these concepts
is the important mechanism of attribute and relationship inheritance. Unfortu-
nately, no standard terminology exists for these concepts, so we use the most com-
mon terminology. Alternative terminology is given in footnotes. We also describe a
diagrammatic technique for displaying these concepts when they arise in an EER
schema. We call the resulting schema diagrams enhanced ER or EER diagrams.

The first enhanced ER (EER) model concept we take up is that of a subtype or
subclass of an entity type. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the name of an entity type is
used to represent both a type of entity and the entity set or collection of entities of that
type that exist in the database. For example, the entity type EMPLOYEE describes the
type (that is, the attributes and relationships) of each employee entity, and also refers
to the current set of EMPLOYEE entities in the COMPANY database. In many cases an
entity type has numerous subgroupings or subtypes of its entities that are meaningful
and need to be represented explicitly because of their significance to the database
application. For example, the entities that are members of the EMPLOYEE entity
type may be distinguished further into SECRETARY, ENGINEER, MANAGER,
TECHNICIAN, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE, HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, and so on. The set or
collection of entities in each of the latter groupings is a subset of the entities that
belong to the EMPLOYEE entity set, meaning that every entity that is a member of
one of these subgroupings is also an employee. We call each of these subgroupings a
