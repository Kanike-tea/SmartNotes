generally be of any degree, but the ones most common are binary relationships.
Higher-degree relationships are generally more complex than binary relationships;
we characterize them further in Section 3.9.

Relationships as Attributes. It is sometimes convenient to think of a binary rela-
tionship type in terms of attributes, as we discussed in Section 3.3.3. Consider the
WORKS _FOR relationship type in Figure 3.9. One can think of an attribute called
Department of the EMPLOYEE entity type, where the value of Department for each
EMPLOYEE entity is (a reference to) the DEPARTMENT entity for which that
employee works. Hence, the value set for this Department attribute is the set of all
DEPARTMENT entities, which is the DEPARTMENT entity set. This is what we did in
Figure 3.8 when we specified the initial design of the entity type EMPLOYEE for the
COMPANY database. However, when we think of a binary relationship as an attribute,
we always have two options or two points of view. In this example, the alternative point
of view is to think of a multivalued attribute Employees of the entity type
DEPARTMENT whose value for each DEPARTMENT entity is the set of EMPLOYEE enti-
ties who work for that department. The value set of this Employees attribute is the power
set of the EMPLOYEE entity set. Either of these two attributes—Department of
EMPLOYEE or Employees of DEPARTMENT—can represent the WORKS_FOR relation-
ship type. If both are represented, they are constrained to be inverses of each other.

®This concept of representing relationship types as attributes is used in a class of data models called
functional data models. In object databases (see Chapter 12), relationships can be represented by
reference attributes, either in one direction or in both directions as inverses. In relational databases
(see Chapter 5), foreign keys are a type of reference attribute used to represent relationships.
