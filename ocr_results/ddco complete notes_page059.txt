where S and R stand for set and reset. It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates.
The stored bit is present on the output marked Q.

While_the S and R inputs are both low, feedback maintains the Q and Q outputs in a constant state,
with Q the complement of Q. If S (Set) is pulsed high while R (Reset) is held low, then the Q output is forced
high, and stays high when S returns to low; similarly, if R is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output
is forced low, and stays low when R returns to low.

SR latch with control input

It consists of the basic SR latch and two additional NAND gates. The control input En
acts as an enable signal for the other two inputs. The outputs of the NAND gates stay
at the logic-1 level as long as the enable signal remains at 0. This is the quiescent
condition for the SR latch. When the enable input goes to 1, information from the S or
R input is allowed to affect the latch. The set state is reached with S = 1, R = 0, and
En = 1 active-high enabled). To change to the reset state, the inputs must be S = 0, R
= 1, and En = 1. In either case, when En returns to 0, the circuit remains in its
current state. The control input disables the circuit by applying 0 to En, so that the
state of the output does not change regardless of the values of S and R . Moreover,
when En = 1 and both the S and R inputs are equal to 0, the state of the circuit does
