Shape: Stents can be designed in a variety of shapes, including cylindrical, helical, and spiralled, to match
the shape of the blood vessel and provide adequate support.

Material: Stents can be made of different materials, including stainless steel, cobalt chromium, and nitinol
(a type of metal that is flexible and can return to its original shape after being expanded).

Coating: Stents can be coated with different materials to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce the
risk of restenosis (recurrent blockage of the blood vessel).

Expansion mechanism: Stents can be designed to expand in different ways, such as by balloon inflation
or self-expansion, depending on the type of stent and the specific medical condition it is used to treat.
Overall, the design of stents plays an important role in their effectiveness and safety. Stents must be
designed to provide adequate support to the blood vessel, prevent restenosis, and minimize the risk of

complications such as blood clots.

Parts of the Human Eye

* Sclera: The outer covering of the eye is called the sclera. It is a protective tough white layer (white part
of the eye).

* Cornea: The transparent part in front of the sclera is called the cornea. Light enters the eye through the
comea, it bends(refracts) the light passes through it. It also protects the eye and also doesn't allow foreign
particles to enter the eye.

+ Iris: It is a dark, muscular tissue and ring-like structure present behind the cornea. The colour of the eye
is due to the colour of the iris. The iris regulates the amount and intensity of light entering the eyes by

adjusting the size of the iris.
