546 Chapter 14 Memory Management Units

An additional special feature in an ARM MMU is the Fast Context Switch Extension.
The Fast Context Switch Extension improves performance in a multitasking environment
because it does not require flushing the caches or TLB during a context switch.

A working example ofa small virtual memory system provided in-depth details to set up
the MMU to support multitasking. The steps in setting up the demonstration are to define
the regions used in the fixed system software of virtual memory, define the virtual memory
maps for each task, locate the fixed and task regions into the physical memory map, define
and locate the page tables within the page table region, define the data structures needed
to create and manage the regions and page tables, initialize the MMU by using the defined
region data to create page table entries and write them to the page tables, and establish a
context switch procedure to transition from one task to the next.
