3.4 Exhaustive Search

Many important problems require finding an element with a special property ina
domain that grows exponentially (or faster) with an instance size. Typically, such
problems arise in situations that involve—explicitly or implicitly—combinatorial
objects such as permutations, combinations, and subsets of a given set. Many such
problems are optimization problems: they ask to find an element that maximizes
or minimizes some desired characteristic such as a path length or an assignment
cost.

Exhaustive search is simply a brute-force approach to combinatorial prob-
lems. It suggests generating each and every element of the problem domain, se-
lecting those of them that satisfy all the constraints, and then finding a desired
element (e.g., the one that optimizes some objective function). Note that although
the idea of exhaustive search is quite straightforward, its implementation typically
requires an algorithm for generating certain combinatorial objects. We delay a dis-
cussion of such algorithms until the next chapter and assume here that they exist.
