HDL MODELS OF COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS

The module is the basic building block for modeling hardware with the Verilog HDL. The logic of a
module can be described in any one (or a combination) of the following modeling styles:

©@ Gate-level modeling using instantiations of predefined and user-defined primitive gates.
@ Dataflow modeling using continuous assignment statements with the keyword assign.

@ Behavioral modeling using procedural assignment statements with the keyword always.

Gate-level (structural) modeling describes a circuit by specifying its gates and how they are connected
with each other. Dataflow modeling is used mostly for describing the Boolean equations of
combinational logic. Combinational logic can be designed with truth tables, Boolean equations, and
schematics; Verilog has a construct corresponding to each of these “classical” approaches to design:
user-defined primitives, continuous assignments, and primitives, as shown in Fig below. There is one
other modeling style, called switch-level modeling. It is sometimes used in the simulation of MOS
transistor circuit models, but not in logic synthesis. We will not consider switch-level modeling.

Gate-Level Modeling

In this type of representation, a circuit is specified by its logic gates and their interconnections. Gate-
level modeling provides a textual description of a schematic diagram. The Verilog HDL includes 12
basic gates as predefined primitives. Four of these primitive gates are of the three-state type. The other
eight are the basic gates listed. They are all declared with the lowercase keywords and, nand, or, nor,
xor, xnor, not, and buf. Primitives such as and are n-input primitives. They can have any number of
scalar inputs (e.g., a three-input and primitive). The buf and not primitives are n -output primitives.
A single input can drive multiple output lines distinguished by their identifiers. The Verilog language
includes a functional description of each type of gate, too. The logic of each gate is based on a four-
valued system. When the gates are simulated, the simulator assigns one value to the output of each gate
at any instant. In addition to the two logic values of 0 and 1, there are two other values: unknown and
high impedance. An unknown value is denoted by x and a high impedance by z. An unknown value is
assigned during simulation when the logic value of a signal is ambiguous—for instance, if it cannot be
determined whether its value is 0 or | (e.g., a flip-flop without a reset condition). A high-impedance
condition occurs at the output of three-state gates that are not enabled or if a wire is inadvertently left
