¢ The encoder defined in Table 4.7 has the limitation that only one input can be active at any given
time. If two inputs are active simultaneously, the output produces an undefined combination. For

example, if D3 and D6 are 1 simultaneously, the output of the encoder will be 111 because all three
outputs are equal to 1.

¢ To resolve this ambiguity, encoder circuits must establish an input priority to ensure that only one
input is encoded.

¢ The output 111 does not represent either binary 3 or binary 6. To resolve this ambiguity, encoder
circuits must establish an input priority to ensure that only one input is encoded. If we establish a higher
priority for inputs with higher subscript numbers, and if both D3 and D6 are | at the same time, the output

will be 110 because D6 has higher priority than D3. Another ambiguity in the octal-to-binary encoder is
