Some features of these shark skin inspired swimsuits include:

Low-friction materials: The swimsuits are made from smooth, high-tech materials that
reduce friction in the water, thereby reducing drag and improving a swimmer's speed.

Compression: The swimsuits are designed to provide compression on the swimmer's
body, which could help improve blood flow and muscle support during races.

4. Discuss the structure of kingfisher beak and its practical applications.

Answer:

The kingfisher is a fascinating bird known for its distinctive beak and remarkable hunting
skills.

Characteristics:

Length and Shape: The beak of a kingfisher is relatively long and straight. It is sharp
and pointed, which allows the bird to dive into the water swiftly to catch its prey.

Dagger-like Tip: At the end of the beak, there is a dagger-like tip that helps the
kingfisher grasp and immobilize its prey. This tip is essential for catching and holding
fish underwater.

Nostrils: The beak has specialized nostrils positioned at the base of the bill, which are
designed to prevent water from entering while the kingfisher dives into the water.

This adaptation allows them to hunt effectively without getting their nostrils clogged
with water.

Binocular Vision: Kingfishers have excellent binocular vision due to their eyes being
positioned on the sides of their heads.

This adaptation enables them to accurately gauge distances and pinpoint their prey, both
in the air and underwater.
