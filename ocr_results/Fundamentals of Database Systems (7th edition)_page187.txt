5.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas

The uppercase letters Q, R, S denote relation names.
The lowercase letters q, r, s denote relation states.
The letters ¢, u, v denote tuples.

In general, the name of a relation schema such as STUDENT also indicates
the current set of tuples in that relation—the current relation state—whereas
STUDENT(Name, Ssn, ...) refers only to the relation schema.

= Anattribute A can be qualified with the relation name R to which it belongs
by using the dot notation R.A—for example, STUDENT.Name or
STUDENT.Age. This is because the same name may be used for two attri-
butes in different relations. However, all attribute names in a particular
relation must be distinct.

= An n-tuple ¢ ina relation r(R) is denoted by t = <v,, v2, ... , v,>, where vj is
the value corresponding to attribute A;. The following notation refers to
component values of tuples:

© Both ¢{A;] and ¢.A; (and sometimes ¢[i]) refer to the value v; in f for attri-

bute Aj.
5 Both t{A,, A,, ...,A,] and t.(A,, A, -..,Az), where A,, A, ..., Az isa list
of attributes from R, refer to the subtuple of values <v,,, v,,, ... , v> from

corresponding to the attributes specified in the list.

As an example, consider the tuple f = <’Barbara Benson’, ‘533-69-1238’,
‘(817)839-8461’, ‘7384 Fontana Lane’, NULL, 19, 3.25> from the STUDENT relation in Fig-
ure 5.1; we have t{Name] = <‘Barbara Benson’>, and t[Ssn, Gpa, Age] = <“533-69-1238’,
3.25, 19>.

5.2 Relational Model Constraints
and Relational Database Schemas

So far, we have discussed the characteristics of single relations. In a relational data-
base, there will typically be many relations, and the tuples in those relations are
usually related in various ways. The state of the whole database will correspond to
the states of all its relations at a particular point in time. There are generally many
restrictions or constraints on the actual values in a database state. These constraints
are derived from the rules in the miniworld that the database represents, as we dis-
cussed in Section 1.6.8.

In this section, we discuss the various restrictions on data that can be specified on a
relational database in the form of constraints. Constraints on databases can gener-
ally be divided into three main categories:

1. Constraints that are inherent in the data model. We call these inherent
model-based constraints or implicit constraints.
2. Constraints that can be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model, typi-

cally by specifying them in the DDL (data definition language, see Section 2.3.1).
We call these schema-based constraints or explicit constraints.
