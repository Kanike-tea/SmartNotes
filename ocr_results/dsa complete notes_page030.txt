Implementation of stack

Stack is implemented by using a one-dimensional array, stack [MAX_STACK_SIZE], where MAX
is the maximum number of entries.

e The first, or bottom, element of the stack is stored in stack [0], the second in stack [1], and the
ith in stack [i-1].

e Variable top points to the top element in the stack.

¢ Top=-1 to denote an empty stack.

ADTStack is
objects: a finite ordered list with zero or more elements.
