may have. In the future the number and letter combinations may change as more features
are added. Note the nomenclature does not include the architecture revision information.
There are a few additional points to make about the ARM nomenclature:

= AILARM cores after the ARM7TDMI include the TDMI features even though they may
not include those letters after the “ARM” label.

= The processor family is a group of processor implementations that share the same
hardware characteristics. For example, the ARM7TDMI, ARM740T, and ARM720T all
share the same family characteristics and belong to the ARM7 family.

= JTAGis described by IEEE 1149.1 Standard Test Access Port and boundary scan archi-
tecture. It is a serial protocol used by ARM to send and receive debug information
between the processor core and test equipment.

= = EmbeddedICE macrocell is the debug hardware built into the processor that allows
breakpoints and watchpoints to be set.

= Synthesizable means that the processor core is supplied as source code that can be
compiled into a form easily used by EDA tools.

2.6.2) ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION

The architecture has continued to evolve since the first ARM processor implementation
was introduced in 1985. Table 2.7 shows the significant architecture enhancements from
the original architecture version 1 to the current version 6 architecture. One of the most
significant changes to the ISA was the introduction of the Thumb instruction set in ARMv4T
(the ARM7TDMI processor).

Table 2.8 summarizes the various parts of the program status register and the availabil-
ity of certain features on particular instruction architectures. “All” refers to the ARMv4
architecture and above.

2.7 ARM PROCESSOR FAMILIES

ARM has designed a number of processors that are grouped into different families according
to the core they use. The families are based on the ARM7, ARM9, ARM10, and ARM11
cores. The postfix numbers 7, 9, 10, and 11 indicate different core designs. The ascending
number equates to an increase in performance and sophistication. ARM8 was developed
but was soon superseded.

Table 2.9 shows a rough comparison of attributes between the ARM7, ARM9, ARM10,
and ARM11I cores. The numbers quoted can vary greatly and are directly dependent upon
the type and geometry of the manufacturing process, which has a direct effect on the
frequency (MHz) and power consumption (watts).
