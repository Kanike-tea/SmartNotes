of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

d. Each section has an instructor (Iname), semester (Semester), year (Year),
course (Sec_course), and section number (Sec_num). The section number
distinguishes different sections of the same course that are taught during
the same semester/year; its values are 1, 2, 3, ... , up to the total number of
sections taught during each semester.

e. A grade record refers to a student (Ssn), a particular section, and a
grade (Grade).

Design a relational database schema for this database application. First show
all the functional dependencies that should hold among the attributes. Then
design relation schemas for the database that are each in 3NF or BCNE. Spec-
ify the key attributes of each relation. Note any unspecified requirements,
and make appropriate assumptions to render the specification complete.

. What update anomalies occur in the EMP_PROJ and EMP_DEPT relations of
Figures 14.3 and 14.4?

. In what normal form is the LOTS relation schema in Figure 14.12(a) with
respect to the restrictive interpretations of normal form that take only the
primary key into account? Would it be in the same normal form if the gen-
eral definitions of normal form were used?

. Prove that any relation schema with two attributes is in BCNF.

. Why do spurious tuples occur in the result of joining the EMP_PROJ1 and
EMP_LOCS relations in Figure 14.5 (result shown in Figure 14.6)?

. Consider the universal relation R = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J} and the set
of functional dependencies F = {{A, B}>{C}, {A}{D, E}, {B}>{F},
{F}—{G, H}, {D}>{1, J}}. What is the key for R? Decompose R into 2NF and
then 3NF relations.

. Repeat Exercise 14.24 for the following different set of functional dependen-
cies G= {{A, B}>{C}, {B, D} 9{E, F}, {A, D} 1G, H}, {A} {I (HJ OU}.

. Consider the following relation:

A B Cc |TUPLE#
10 bl cl 1

10 b2 2.
ll b4 cl
12 b3, c4
13 bl cl
14 b3 c4

a. Given the previous extension (state), which of the following dependen-
cies may hold in the above relation? If the dependency cannot hold,
explain why by specifying the tuples that cause the violation.
