Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP

they are available on most computer platforms. A PHP interpreter provides a Hyper-
text Preprocessor, which will execute PHP commands in a text file and create the
desired HTML file. To access databases, a library of PHP functions needs to be
included in the PHP interpreter, as we will discuss in Section 11.3. PHP programs
are executed on the Web server computer. This is in contrast to some scripting lan-
guages, such as JavaScript, that are executed on the client computer. There are many
other popular scripting languages that can be used to access databases and create
dynamic Web pages, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and PERL, to name a few.

This chapter is organized as follows. Section 11.1 gives a simple example to illustrate
how PHP can be used. Section 11.2 gives a general overview of the PHP language
and how it is used to program some basic functions for interactive Web pages. Sec-
tion 11.3 focuses on using PHP to interact with SQL databases through a library of
functions known as PEAR DB. Section 11.4 lists some of the additional technologies
associated with Java for Web and database programming (we already discussed
JDBC and SQLJ in Chapter 10). Finally, Section 11.5 contains a chapter summary.

11.1 A Simple PHP Example

PHP is an open source general-purpose scripting language. The interpreter engine
for PHP is written in the C programming language so it can be used on nearly all
types of computers and operating systems. PHP usually comes installed with the
UNIX operating system. For computer platforms with other operating systems
such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS, the PHP interpreter can be downloaded from:
http://www.php.net. As with other scripting languages, PHP is particularly suited
for manipulation of text pages, and in particular for manipulating dynamic HTML
pages at the Web server computer. This is in contrast to JavaScript, which is down-
loaded with the Web pages to execute on the client computer.

PHP has libraries of functions for accessing databases stored under various types of
relational database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, and any system
that supports the ODBC standard (see Chapter 10). Under the three-tier architec-
ture (see Chapter 2), the DBMS would reside at the bottom-tier database server.
PHP would run at the middle-tier Web server, where the PHP program commands
would manipulate the HTML files to create the customized dynamic Web pages.
The HTML is then sent to the client tier for display and interaction with the user.

Consider the PHP example shown in Figure 11.1(a), which prompts a user to enter
the first and last name and then prints a welcome message to that user. The line
numbers are not part of the program code; they are used below for explanation
purposes only:

1. Suppose that the file containing PHP script in program segment P1 is stored in
the following Internet location: http://www.myserver.com/example/greeting.php.
Then ifa user types this address in the browser, the PHP interpreter would start
interpreting the code and produce the form shown in Figure 11.1(b). We will
explain how that happens as we go over the lines in code segment P1.
