Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts

23.9 Summary

In this chapter, we provided an introduction to distributed databases. This is a very
broad topic, and we discussed only some of the basic techniques used with distrib-
uted databases. First in Section 23.1 we discussed the reasons for distribution and
DDB concepts in Section 23.1.1. Then we defined the concept of distribution trans-
parency and the related concepts of fragmentation transparency and replication
transparency in Section 23.1.2. We discussed the concepts of distributed availability
and reliability in Section 23.1.3, and gave an overview of scalability and partition
tolerance issues in Section 23.1.4. We discussed autonomy of nodes in a distributed
system in Section 23.1.5 and the potential advantages of distributed databases over
centralized system in Section 23.1.6.

In Section 23.2, we discussed the design issues related to data fragmentation,
replication, and distribution. We distinguished between horizontal fragmenta-
tion (sharding) and vertical fragmentation of relations in Section 23.2.1. We
then discussed in Section 23.2.2 the use of data replication to improve system
reliability and availability. In Section 23.3, we briefly discussed the concur-
rency control and recovery techniques used in DDBMSs, and then reviewed
some of the additional problems that must be dealt with in a distributed envi-
ronment that do not appear in a centralized environment. Then in Section 23.4
we discussed transaction management, including different commit protocols
(2-phase commit, 3-phase commit) and operating system support for transac-
tion management.

We then illustrated some of the techniques used in distributed query processing in
Section 23.5, and discussed the cost of communication among sites, which is con-
sidered a major factor in distributed query optimization. We compared the differ-
ent techniques for executing joins, and we then presented the semijoin technique
for joining relations that reside on different sites in Section 23.5.3.

Following that, in Section 23.6, we categorized DDBMSs by using criteria such as
the degree of homogeneity of software modules and the degree of local autonomy.
In Section 23.7 we distinguished between parallel and distributed system architec-
tures and then introduced the generic architecture of distributed databases from
both a component as well as a schematic architectural perspective. In Section 23.7.3
we discussed in some detail issues of federated database management, and we
focused on the needs of supporting various types of autonomies and dealing with
semantic heterogeneity. We also reviewed the client/server architecture concepts
and related them to distributed databases in Section 23.7.4. We reviewed catalog
management in distributed databases and summarized their relative advantages
and disadvantages in Section 23.8.

Chapters 24 and 25 will describe recent advances in distributed databases and dis-
tributed computing related to big data. Chapter 24 describes the so-called NOSQL
systems, which are highly scalable, distributed database systems that handle large
volumes of data. Chapter 25 discusses cloud computing and distributed computing
technologies that are needed to process big data.
