on). A complex has a location, chief organizing individual, total occupied
area, and so on. Each complex holds a series of events (e.g., the track sta-
dium may hold many different races). For each event there is a planned date,
duration, number of participants, number of officials, and so on. A roster of
all officials will be maintained together with the list of events each official
will be involved in. Different equipment is needed for the events (e.g., goal
posts, poles, parallel bars) as well as for maintenance. The two types of facil-
ities (one-sport and multisport) will have different types of information. For
each type, the number of facilities needed is kept, together with an approxi-
mate budget.

Identify all the important concepts represented in the library database case
study described below. In particular, identify the abstractions of classifica-
tion (entity types and relationship types), aggregation, identification, and
specialization/generalization. Specify (min, max) cardinality constraints
whenever possible. List details that will affect the eventual design but that
have no bearing on the conceptual design. List the semantic constraints sep-
arately. Draw an EER diagram of the library database.

Case Study: The Georgia Tech Library (GTL) has approximately 16,000
members, 100,000 titles, and 250,000 volumes (an average of 2.5 copies per
book). About 10% of the volumes are out on loan at any one time. The librar-
ians ensure that the books that members want to borrow are available when
the members want to borrow them. Also, the librarians must know how
many copies of each book are in the library or out on loan at any given time.
A catalog of books is available online that lists books by author, title, and
subject area. For each title in the library, a book description is kept in the
catalog; the description ranges from one sentence to several pages. The refer-
ence librarians want to be able to access this description when members
request information about a book. Library staff includes chief librarian,
departmental associate librarians, reference librarians, check-out staff, and
library assistants.

Books can be checked out for 21 days. Members are allowed to have only
five books out at a time. Members usually return books within three to four
weeks. Most members know that they have one week of grace before a
notice is sent to them, so they try to return books before the grace period
ends. About 5% of the members have to be sent reminders to return books.
Most overdue books are returned within a month of the due date. Approxi-
mately 5% of the overdue books are either kept or never returned. The most
active members of the library are defined as those who borrow books at
least ten times during the year. The top 1% of membership does 15% of the
borrowing, and the top 10% of the membership does 40% of the borrowing.
About 20% of the members are totally inactive in that they are members
who never borrow.

To become a member of the library, applicants fill out a form including their
SSN, campus and home mailing addresses, and phone numbers. The librari-
