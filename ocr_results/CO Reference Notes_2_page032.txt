The Read Operation proceeds as follows:

¢ At t0, master places address/command information on bus.

¢ At tl, master sets MR-signal to 1 to inform all devices that the address/command-info is ready.
> MR-signal =1 > causes all devices on the bus to decode theaddress.
> The delay t1 — tO is intended to allow for any skew that may occurs on the bus.
> Skew occurs when 2 signals transmitted from 1 source arrive at destination at different time
> Therefore, the delay t1 — t0 should be larger than the maximum possible bus skew.

© At t2, slave
— performs required input-operation &
— sets SR signal to | to inform all devices that it is ready (Figure 7.6).

¢ At t3, SR signal arrives at master indicating that the input-data are available on bus.

¢ At t4, master removes address/command information from bus.

¢ Att5, when the device-interface receives the 1-to-0 transition of MR signal, it removes data and

SR signal from the bus. This completes the input transfer.

Figure 7.6 — Handshake control of data transfer during an input operation.

¢ A change of state is one signal is followed by a change is the other signal. Hence this scheme
is called as Full Handshake.
« Advantage: It provides the higher degree of flexibility and reliability.

INTERFACE-CIRCUITS

« An I/O Interface consists of the circuitry required to connect an I/O device to a computer-bus.

© On one side of the interface, we have bus signals.
On the other side, we have a data path with its associated controls to transfer data between the
interface and the I/O device known as port.

© Two types are:
1. Parallel Port transfers data in the form of a number of bits (8 or 16) simultaneously to
or from the device.
2. Serial Port transmits and receives data one bit at a time.

© Communication with the bus is the same for both formats.

¢ The conversion from the parallel to the serial format, and vice versa, takes place inside the

interface- circuit.
