Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP

29.1 Introduction, Definitions, and Terminology

In Chapter 1, we defined a database as a collection of related data and a database
system as a database and database software together. A data warehouse is also a col-
lection of information as well as a supporting system. However, a clear distinction
exists. Traditional databases are transactional (relational, object-oriented, network,
or hierarchical). Data warehouses have the distinguishing characteristic that they
are mainly intended for decision-support applications. They are optimized for data
retrieval, not routine transaction processing.

Because data warehouses have been developed in numerous organizations to meet
particular needs, there is no single, canonical definition of the term data warehouse.
Professional magazine articles and books in the popular press have elaborated on
the meaning in a variety of ways. Vendors have capitalized on the popularity of the
term to help market a variety of related products, and consultants have provided a
large variety of services, all under the data warehousing banner. However, data
warehouses are distinct from traditional databases in their structure, functioning,
performance, and purpose.

W. H. Inmon! characterized a data warehouse as a subject-oriented, integrated,
nonvolatile, time-variant collection of data in support of management's decisions.
Data warehouses provide access to data for complex analysis, knowledge discovery,
and decision making through ad hoc and canned queries. Canned queries refer to
a-priori defined queries with parameters that may recur with high frequency. They
support high-performance demands on an organization’s data and information.
Several types of applications—OLAP, DSS, and data mining applications—are sup-
ported. We define each of these next.

OLAP (online analytical processing) is a term used to describe the analysis of
complex data from the data warehouse. In the hands of skilled knowledge workers,
OLAP tools enable quick and straightforward querying of the analytical data stored
in data warehouses and data marts (analytical databases similar to data warehouses
but with a defined narrow scope).

DSS (decision-support systems), also known as EIS (or MIS)—executive
information systems (or management information systems), not to be confused
with enterprise integration systems—support an organization’s leading decision
makers with higher-level (analytical) data for complex and important decisions.
Data mining (which we discussed in Chapter 28) is used for knowledge discovery,
the ad hoc process of searching data for unanticipated new knowledge (not unlike
looking for pearls of wisdom in an ocean of data).

Traditional databases support online transaction processing (OLTP), which
includes insertions, updates, and deletions while also supporting information query
requirements. Traditional relational databases are optimized to process queries that

'Inmon (1992) is credited with initially using the term warehouse. Inmon et al. (2008) is titled “DW 2.0:
