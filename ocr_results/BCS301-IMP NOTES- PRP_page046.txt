Higher transition probabilities:

Let P be an x n transition probability matrix of the Markov chain with the probabilities pj,1 <i,j <n, is
called changes from a; to the state a;, that is a;  aj.The probabilities that the system changes from a, to
the state a; in exists n steps is denoted by p™,, and the matrix formed by the probabilities p™ ;is called

the n - step transition matrix , denoted by P) and initial probabilities are defined as,
PO = [pp px, pao Px]

P® = [pi p2, ps, pa... Pa]
p® = [p.®, p2™, ps2, pa... Pn]
P™ = [p.™,p2™, ps, pa... Pn™ |

And p®,p®, p®, p®.... will be evaluated as
p® = pp, p®@) = p@p = pp2, p® = p@p = pOP?,.... p™ = p&p = pOpn
