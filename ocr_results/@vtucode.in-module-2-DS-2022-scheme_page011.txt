MODULE 2
To divide the array into roughly equal segments
top[0] = boundary[0] = -1;
for (j= 1;j<n; j++)
top[j] = boundary[j] = (MEMORY_SIZE / n) * j;
boundary[n] = MEMORY_SIZE - 1;
fe) [m/n] 2 [m/n] m-1

boundary[0] boundary[1] boundary[n!
top[0] top[1]

All stacks are empty and divided into roughly equal segments

Figure: Initial configuration for n stacks in.memory [m].

In the figure, n is the number of stacks.entered by the user, n < MAX_STACKS, and

m=MEMORY_SIZE. Stack i grow from boundary[i] + 1 to boundary [i + 1] before it is

full. A boundary for the last stack is needed, so set boundary [n] to MEMORY_SIZE-1.

Implementation of theadd_ operation

void push(int i, element item)

{ /* add an item to the ith stack */
if (top{i] == boundary[i+1])
stackFull(i);
memory[++top[i]] =
item;

Program: Add an item to the ith stack
