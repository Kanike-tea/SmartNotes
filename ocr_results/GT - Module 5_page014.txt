2.5.1. Chromatic Polynomials 143

We note that G, is the same as K3, G2 is the same as K, and G; 9 G2 is the same as K

using the multiplication theorem (Theorem 2), we obtain

Hence

This is the chromatic polynomial for the given graph G.*
For A = 5, this polynomial gives

This means that if 5 colours are

etna |se the Decomposition Theorem to find the chromatic polynomial for the graph

Shown in Figure 2.51

> Let us denote the given graph (shown in Figure 2.51) by G and the edge {v), v2} by e. Then

' the graphs G, and G/, (as defined in the Decomposition Theorem) would be as shown in Figure
