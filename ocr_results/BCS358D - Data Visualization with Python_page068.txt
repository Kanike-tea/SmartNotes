LAB PROGRAM 07 (a)

7 a) Write a Python program which explains uses of customizing seaborn plots with

Aesthetic functions.

Aim: Demonstration of customizing seaborn plots with Aesthetic functions.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

The below program demonstrates how to customizing seaborn plots with Aesthetic functions
using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Make sure you have Matplotlib and Seaborn installed before

running this code. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Import Seaborn and Matplotlib: The program begins by importing the required libraries,
seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

2. Load a Sample Dataset: The "tips" dataset is a built-in dataset provided by Seaborn. The
line tips = sns.load_dataset("tips") is used to load the "tips" dataset from Seaborn. It
contains information about restaurant bills and tips, and it is included as a sample dataset
for use in data analysis and visualization with Seaborn.

3. Set Plot Style: sns.set_style("whitegrid") is used to set the overall style for the entire plot.
In this case, the "whitegrid" style is chosen, which adds a white grid to the background.

4. Create a Figure and Axis Objects: fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6)) creates a figure
and axis objects using Matplotlib. The figsize parameter specifies the size of the figure as
8 units in width and 6 units in height.

5. Customize the Plot Using Aesthetic Functions:

©  sns.set_palette("Set2") sets the color palette for the plot to "Set2." This will
determine the colors used in the plot.
© sns.set_context("paper") customizes the context of the plot. Here, the "paper"
context is chosen, which scales the plot elements to a size suitable for use in a
document.
¢  sns.set(font_scale=1 .2) increases the font size in the plot by a factor of 1.2.
6. Create a Violin Plot: sns.violinplot() is used to create a violin plot. The x, y, and hue

parameters are set to specify the variables for the x-axis, y-axis, and color differentiation
