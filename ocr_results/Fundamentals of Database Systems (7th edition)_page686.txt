The term optimization is actually a misnomer because in some cases the chosen
execution plan is not the optimal (or absolute best) strategy—it is just a reasonably
efficient or the best available strategy for executing the query. Finding the optimal
strategy is usually too time-consuming—except for the simplest of queries. In addi-
tion, trying to find the optimal query execution strategy requires accurate and
detailed information about the size of the tables and distributions of things such as
column values, which may not be always available in the DBMS catalog. Further-
more, additional information such as the size of the expected result must be derived
based on the predicates in the query. Hence, planning of a good execution strategy
may be a more accurate description than query optimization.

For lower-level navigational database languages in legacy systems—such as the net-
work DML or the hierarchical DL/1 the programmer must choose the query execu-
tion strategy while writing a database program. If a DBMS provides only a
navigational language, there is a limited opportunity for extensive query optimiza-
tion by the DBMS; instead, the programmer is given the capability to choose the
query execution strategy. On the other hand, a high-level query language—such as
SQL for relational DBMSs (RDBMSs) or OQL (see Chapter 12) for object DBMSs
(ODBMSs)—is more declarative in nature because it specifies what the intended
results of the query are rather than identifying the details of how the result should
be obtained. Query optimization is thus necessary for queries that are specified in a
high-level query language.
