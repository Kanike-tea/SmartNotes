5.11] Introduction ~

In our day to-day life.it becomes quite, often necessary to draw some valid and
reasonable conclusions, concerning a large mass of individuals or. things. It becomes
practically impossible to. examine every individual or the entire group known as
population. Therefore we may prefer fo examine a small part of this population known
as a sample with the motive of drawing some conclusion about the entire population
based on the information/result revealed by the sample. The entire process known as
statistical inference aims in ascertaining maximum information about the population
with minimum. effort and time. Poll prediction is a good example for statistical
inference." ;

A large collection of individuals or attributes or numerical data can be understood as

°a population or utiverse. :
A finite subset ei universe is called a sample. The number of individuals ina sample

is called a saniple size. If the sample size (n ) is less than or equal to.30 the sample is
saidtobe small, otherwise itis alarge sample. i
The process of selecting asample from the populationis called assampling.

' Theselection of an individual oritem from the population in such a way thateachhas
the same chance of being selected is called as random sampling. Suppose we take a
sample of size n from a finite population of size N, then we will have N._ possible

. n
samples. Random sampling is a technique in which each of the Nc samples has an
equal chanceof beingselected.

Sampling where ainemberof the population may beselected more than onceiscalled
as sampling with replacement, on the otherhand ifamembercannotbechosen more than
_ onceis called as sampling without replacement.

Simple samplin visa special caseof random sampling in which trials areindependent
andthe probability of success is a constant.

The word statisticis often used for the random variable or for its values.
