Mnemonics ARM ISA Description

SMULxy vSE signed multiply instructions (16 x 16 = 32-bit)

SMULWy vSE signed multiply instruction ((32 x 16) >> 16 = 32-bit)

STC STC2 v2 v5 store to memory single or multiple 32-bit values from coprocessor
STM vl store multiple 32-bit registers to memory

STR vl v4 v5SE store register to a virtual address in memory

SUB vl subtract two 32-bit values

SWI vl software interrupt

SWP v2a swap a word/byte in memory with a register, without interruption
TEQ vl test for equality of two 32-bit values

TST vl test for bits in a 32-bit value

UMLAL v3M unsigned multiply accumulate long ((32 x 32) + 64 = 64-bit)
UMULL v3M unsigned multiply long (32 x 32 = 64-bit)

executed. We will represent hexadecimal numbers with the prefix 0x and binary numbers
with the prefix Ob. The examples follow this format:

PRE —_<pre-conditions>
<instruction/s>
POST <post-conditions>

In the pre- and post-conditions, memory is denoted as
mem<data_size>[address]

This refers to data_size bits of memory starting at the given byte address. For example,
mem32(1024] is the 32-bit value starting at address 1 KB.

ARM instructions process data held in registers and only access memory with load and
store instructions. ARM instructions commonly take two or three operands. For instance
the ADD instruction below adds the two values stored in registers rJ and r2 (the source
registers). It writes the result to register r3 (the destination register).

Instruction Destination Source Source
Syntax register (Rd) register 1 (Rn) | register 2 (Rm)
ADD r3, rl, r2 3 rl 2

In the following sections we examine the function and syntax of the ARM
instructions by instruction class—data processing instructions, branch instructions,
