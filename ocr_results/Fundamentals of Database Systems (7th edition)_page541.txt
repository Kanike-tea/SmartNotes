15.1 Further Topics in Functional Dependencies: Inference Rules, Equivalence, and Minimal Cover

If several sets of FDs qualify as minimal covers of E by the definition above, it is
customary to use additional criteria for minimality. For example, we can choose the
minimal set with the smallest number of dependencies or with the smallest total
length (the total length of a set of dependencies is calculated by concatenating the
dependencies and treating them as one long character string).

Algorithm 15.2. Finding a Minimal Cover F for a Set of Functional Depen-
dencies E

Input: A set of functional dependencies E.

Note: Explanatory comments are given at the end of some of the steps. They

follow the format: (+comment).

1. Set F:= E.

2. Replace each functional dependency X — {Aj, Ap, ... , A,} in F by the n
functional dependencies X A, X >A), ..., X > A,,. («This places the FDs
in a canonical form for subsequent testing*)

3. For each functional dependency X > A in F

for each attribute B that is an element of X
if { {F - {X > A} } U { (X - {B} ) > A} } is equivalent to F
then replace X > A with (X - {B}) > A in F.
(This constitutes removal of an extraneous attribute B contained in the left-
hand side X of a functional dependency X > A when possible+)

4. For each remaining functional dependency X — A in F
if {F — {X — A} } is equivalent to F,
then remove X > A from F. (+This constitutes removal of a redundant func-
tional dependency X — A from F when possible*)

We illustrate the above algorithm with the following examples:

Example 1: Let the given set of FDs be E: {B > A, D> A, AB > D}. We have to
find the minimal cover of E.

= All above dependencies are in canonical form (that is, they have only one
attribute on the right-hand side), so we have completed step 1 of Algo-
rithm 15.2 and can proceed to step 2. In step 2 we need to determine if
AB— Dhas any redundant (extraneous) attribute on the left-hand side; that
is, can it be replaced by B— D or A > D?

= Since B — A, by augmenting with B on both sides (IR2), we have BB > AB,
or B — AB (i). However, AB > Das given (ii).

= Hence by the transitive rule (IR3), we get from (i) and (ii), B > D. Thus
AB — D may be replaced by B > D.

= We now have a set equivalent to original E, say E’: {B > A, D> A, B > D}.

No further reduction is possible in step 2 since all FDs have a single attribute
on the left-hand side.
