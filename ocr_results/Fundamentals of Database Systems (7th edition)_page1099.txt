Data Mining Concepts

Ox the last several decades, many organizations
have generated a large amount of machine-read-
able data in the form of files and databases. Existing database technology can pro-
cess this data and supports query languages like SQL. However, SQL is a structured
language that assumes the user is aware of the database schema. SQL supports oper-
ations of relational algebra that allow a user to select rows and columns of data from
tables or join related information from tables based on common fields. In the next
chapter, we will see that data warehousing technology affords several types of func-
tionality: that of consolidation, aggregation, and summarization of data. Data ware-
houses let us view the same information along multiple dimensions. In this chapter,
we will focus our attention on another very popular area of interest known as data
mining. As the term connotes, data mining refers to the mining or discovery of
new information in terms of patterns or rules from vast amounts of data. To be
practically useful, data mining must be carried out efficiently on large files and
databases. Although some data mining features are being provided in RDBMSs,
data mining is not well-integrated with database management systems. The busi-
ness world is presently fascinated by the potential of data mining, and the field of
data mining is popularly called business intelligence or data analytics.

We will briefly review the basic concepts and principles of the extensive field of data
mining, which uses techniques from such areas as machine learning, statistics, neu-
ral networks, and genetic algorithms. We will highlight the nature of the informa-
tion that is discovered, the types of problems faced when trying to mine databases,
and the applications of data mining. We will also survey the state of the art of a large
number of commercial data mining tools (see Section 28.7) and describe a number
of research advances that are needed to make this area viable.
