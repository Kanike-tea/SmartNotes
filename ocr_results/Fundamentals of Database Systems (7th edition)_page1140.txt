the jth position in the vector if the jth row contains the value being indexed. For
example, imagine an inventory of 100,000 cars with a bitmap index on car size. If
there are four car sizes—economy, compact, mid-size, and full-size—there will be
four bit vectors, each containing 100,000 bits (12.5kbytes) for a total index size of 50K.
Bitmap indexing can provide considerable input/output and storage space advan-
tages in low-cardinality domains. With bit vectors, a bitmap index can provide
dramatic improvements in comparison, aggregation, and join performance. We
showed an example of a query on a star schema in Section 19.8, and we also showed
the star schema’s transformation for efficient execution that uses bitmap indexes.

Ina star schema, dimensional data can be indexed to tuples in the fact table by join
indexing. Join indexes are traditional indexes used to maintain relationships
between primary key and foreign key values. They relate the values of a dimension
of a star schema to rows in the fact table. Consider a sales fact table that has city and
fiscal quarter as dimensions. If there is a join index on city, for each city the join
index maintains the tuple IDs of tuples containing that city. Join indexes may
involve multiple dimensions.

Data warehouse storage can facilitate access to summary data by taking further
advantage of the nonvolatility of data warehouses and a degree of predictability of
the analyses that will be performed using them. Two approaches have been used:
(1) smaller tables that include summary data such as quarterly sales or revenue by
product line, and (2) encoding of level (for example, weekly, quarterly, annual) into
existing tables. The overhead of creating and maintaining such aggregations would
likely be excessive in a dynamically changing, transaction-oriented database.

The purpose of master data management (MDM), a popular concept within enter-
prises, is to define the standards, processes, policies, and governance related to the
critical data entities of the organization. The dimension tables—which in a data
warehouse physicalize concepts, such as customers, regions and product catego-
ries—represent essentially the master data. Since dimensions are shared across
multiple facts or reporting data marts, data warehouse designers typically must
spend a considerable amount of time cleansing and harmonizing these dimensions
(ie., reconciling definitional and notional differences across multiple source sys-
tems that the dimension data comes from). As such, table structures containing
these dimensions become good candidates for special copies of master data that can
be used in other environments.
