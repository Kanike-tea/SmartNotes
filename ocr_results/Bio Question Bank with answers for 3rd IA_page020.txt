QCM sensors measure changes in the resonance frequency of a quartz crystal due to the
adsorption of odor molecules. These sensors are highly sensitive and can provide information
about the mass and viscoelastic properties of the detected odorants.

Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensors:

SAW sensors utilize acoustic waves that propagate across the surface of a piezoelectric
substrate. When odor molecules interact with the sensor surface, they cause changes in the
wave propagation, resulting in measurable frequency shifts. SAW sensors offer high sensitivity
and fast response times.

Optical Senso:

Optical sensors employ various principles such as absorbance, luminescence, or refractive
index changes to detect and analyze odor molecules. These sensors can utilize techniques like
colorimetry, fluorescence, or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to provide information about
the chemical properties of the detected odors.

Gas Chromatography (GC) Sensors:

GC-based electronic noses combine gas chromatography with sensor arrays to separate and
detect different odor compounds. The separation is performed using a column, and the eluted
compounds are detected by sensor elements, enabling the identification of specific odor
components.

Materials Used in Electrical Nose Technology
Examples of biomaterials used in Electrical Nose technology include:

: Polymers: Polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), are often used as the matrix or
substrate material in electrical nose sensors, as they are flexible and have a high sensitivity to
volatile organic compounds.

: Carbon Nanotubes: Carbon nanotubes are small tubes made of carbon atoms that have
high electrical conductivity and sensitivity to volatile organic compounds, making them an
attractive material for use in electrical nose sensors.

. Metal Oxides: Metal oxides, such as tin oxide (SnO2) or zinc oxide (ZnO), are
commonly used in electrical nose sensors because of their high sensitivity to volatile organic
compounds and ability to undergo changes in electrical conductivity in response to different
aroma compounds.

. Dendrimers: Dendrimers are synthetic, branched nanostructures that can be
functionalized with specific receptors or enzymes to target specific aroma compounds. They
are being explored as potential materials for use in electrical nose sensors.

. Microfluidic Devices: Microfluidic devices, which are small devices that can
manipulate small volumes of fluid, are being used in the development of electrical nose sensors.
These devices can be made from a variety of materials, including silicon, glass, and polymers,
and can be functionalized with specific receptors or enzymes to target specific aroma
compounds.
