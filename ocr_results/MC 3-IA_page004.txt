The next level is secondary storage—large, slow, relatively inexpensive mass storage devices
such as disk drives or removable memory. Also included in this level is data derived from
peripheral devices, which are characterized by their extremely long access times. Secondary
memory is used to store unused portions of very large programs that do not fit in main memory

and programs that are not currently executing.

It is useful to note that a memory hierarchy depends as much on architectural design as on the
technology surrounding it. For example, TCMand SRAM are of the same technology yet differ

in architectural placement: TCM is located on the chip, while SRAM is located on a board.

A cache may be incorporated between any level in the hierarchy where there is a significant
access time difference between memory components. A cache can improve system performance
whenever such a difference exists. A cache memory system takes information stored in a lower

level of the hierarchy and temporarily moves it to a higher level.

Figure | includes a level 1 (L1) cache and write buffer. The LI cache is an array of high-speed,
on-chip memory that temporarily holds code and data from a slower level. A cache holds this
information to decrease the time required to access both instructions and data. The write buffer is

a very small FIFO buffer that supports writes to main memory from the cache.

An L2 (Level 2 cache not shown in fig) cache is located between the LI cache and slower

memory. The L1 and L2 caches are also known as the primary and secondary caches.
