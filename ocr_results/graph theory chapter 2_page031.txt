Find the chromatic numbers of the following grap

> (i) We note that the graph (a) is the Petersen graph. By observing the graph, we note that
the vertices vj, v3, vg and v7 can be assigned the same colour, say a. Then the vertices
V2, V4, Vg and vig can be assigned the same colour, 6 (other than a). Now, the vertices
vs and vg have to be assigned colours other than @ and f; they can have the same colour
y. Thus, a minimum of three colours are required for a proper colouring of this graph.
Hence, the chromatic number of this graph is 3.,

(ii) By observing the graph (b) (~ this graph is called the Herschel graph), we note that the
Nestiots ¥1» V3, ¥5, V6 and vj1 can be assigned the same colour a and all the remaining
Vertices v2, V4, V7, Vg, V9 and vig can be assigned the same colour B (other than a). Thus,

two colours are Sufficient (-one colour is not sufficient) for a proper colouring of the
graph. Hence its chromatic number is 2. ,
