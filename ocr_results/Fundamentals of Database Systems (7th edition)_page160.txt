Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

4.7.1 Classification and Instantiation

The process of classification involves systematically assigning similar objects/enti-
ties to object classes/entity types. We can now describe (in DB) or reason about (in
KR) the classes rather than the individual objects. Collections of objects that share
the same types of attributes, relationships, and constraints are classified into classes
in order to simplify the process of discovering their properties. Instantiation is the
inverse of classification and refers to the generation and specific examination of
distinct objects of a class. An object instance is related to its object class by the
IS-AN-INSTANCE-OF or IS-A-MEMBER-OF relationship. Although EER dia-
grams do not display instances, the UML diagrams allow a form of instantiation by
permitting the display of individual objects. We did not describe this feature in our
introduction to UML class diagrams.

In general, the objects of a class should have a similar type structure. However,
some objects may display properties that differ in some respects from the other
objects of the class; these exception objects also need to be modeled, and KR
schemes allow more varied exceptions than do database models. In addition, cer-
tain properties apply to the class as a whole and not to the individual objects; KR
schemes allow such class properties. UML diagrams also allow specification of
class properties.

In the EER model, entities are classified into entity types according to their basic
attributes and relationships. Entities are further classified into subclasses and cat-
egories based on additional similarities and differences (exceptions) among them.
Relationship instances are classified into relationship types. Hence, entity types,
subclasses, categories, and relationship types are the different concepts that are
used for classification in the EER model. The EER model does not provide
explicitly for class properties, but it may be extended to do so. In UML, objects
are classified into classes, and it is possible to display both class properties and
individual objects.

Knowledge representation models allow multiple classification schemes in
which one class is an instance of another class (called a meta-class). Notice that
this cannot be represented directly in the EER model, because we have only two
levels—classes and instances. The only relationship among classes in the EER
model is a superclass/subclass relationship, whereas in some KR schemes an
additional class/instance relationship can be represented directly in a class
hierarchy. An instance may itself be another class, allowing multiple-level
classification schemes.

4.7.2 |dentification

Identification is the abstraction process whereby classes and objects are made
uniquely identifiable by means of some identifier. For example, a class name uniquely
identifies a whole class within a schema. An additional mechanism is necessary for
telling distinct object instances apart by means of object identifiers. Moreover, it is
necessary to identify multiple manifestations in the database of the same real-world
