CHAPTER

THE FUTURE
OF THE
ARCHITECTURE

JOHN RAYFIELD

In October 1999, ARM began to consider the future direction of the architecture that would
eventually become ARMV6, first implemented in a new product called ARM1136J-S. By this
time, ARM already had designs for many different applications, and the future requirements
of each of those designs needed to be evaluated, as well as the new application areas for
which ARM would be used in the future.

As system-on-chip designs have become more sophisticated, ARM processors have
become the central processors in systems with multiple processing elements and subsystems.
In particular, the portable and mobile computing markets were introducing new software
and performance challenges for ARM. Areas that needed addressing were digital signal
processing (DSP) and video performance for portable devices, interworking mixed-endian
systems such as TCP/IP, and efficient synchronization in multiprocessing environments.
The challenge for ARM was to address all of these market requirements and yet maintain
its competitive advantage in computational efficiency (computing power per mW) as the
best in the industry.

This chapter describes the components within ARMvé6 introduced by ARM to address
these market requirements, including enhanced DSP support and support for a multi-
processing environment. The chapter also introduces the first high-performance ARMv6
implementations and, in addition to the ARMvé6 technologies, one of ARM’s latest
technologies—TrustZone.
