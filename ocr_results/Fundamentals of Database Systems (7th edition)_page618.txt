using a minimum of four disks. Other nonstandard RAID levels include: RAID 1.5,
RAID 7, RAID-DP, RAID S or Parity RAID, Matrix RAID, RAID-K, RAID-Z,
RAIDn, Linux MD RAID 10, IBM ServeRAID 1E, and unRAID. A discussion of
these nonstandard levels is beyond the scope of this text. Designers of a RAID setup
for a given application mix have to confront many design decisions such as the level
of RAID, the number of disks, the choice of parity schemes, and grouping of disks
for block-level striping. Detailed performance studies on small reads and writes
(referring to I/O requests for one striping unit) and large reads and writes (referring
to I/O requests for one stripe unit from each disk in an error-correction group) have
been performed.

16.11 Modern Storage Architectures

In this section, we describe some recent developments in storage systems that are
becoming an integral part of most enterprise’s information system architectures.
We already mentioned the SATA and SAS interface, which has almost replaced the
previously popular SCSI (small computer system interface) in laptops and small
servers. The Fibre Channel (FC) interface is the predominant choice for storage
networks in data centers. We review some of the modern storage architectures next.

16.11.1 Storage Area Networks

With the rapid growth of electronic commerce, enterprise resource planning (ERP)
systems that integrate application data across organizations, and data warehouses
that keep historical aggregate information (see Chapter 29), the demand for storage
has gone up substantially. For today’s Internet-driven organizations, it has become
necessary to move from a static fixed data center-oriented operation to a more flex-
ible and dynamic infrastructure for the organizations’ information processing
requirements. The total cost of managing all data is growing so rapidly that in many
instances the cost of managing server-attached storage exceeds the cost of the server
itself. Furthermore, the procurement cost of storage is only a small fraction—typi-
cally, only 10 to 15% of the overall cost of storage management. Many users of
RAID systems cannot use the capacity effectively because it has to be attached in a
fixed manner to one or more servers. Therefore, most large organizations have
moved to a concept called storage area networks (SANs). In a SAN, online storage
peripherals are configured as nodes on a high-speed network and can be attached
and detached from servers in a very flexible manner.

Several companies have emerged as SAN providers and supply their own proprie-
tary topologies. They allow storage systems to be placed at longer distances from
the servers and provide different performance and connectivity options. Existing
storage management applications can be ported into SAN configurations using
Fibre Channel networks that encapsulate the legacy SCSI protocol. As a result, the
SAN-attached devices appear as SCSI devices.

Current architectural alternatives for SAN include the following: point-to-point
connections between servers and storage systems via Fiber Channel; use of a Fiber
