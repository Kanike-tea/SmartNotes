(Solution:queue)
31) Which one is faster? A binary search of an orderd set of elements in an array or

asequentialsearch oftheelements.

(Solution:binarysearch)

32) Whatisabalancedtree?

(Solution: A binary tree is balanced if the depth of two subtrees of every node never differ by
morethanone)

33) Whichdatastructureisneeded toconvertinfixnotationstopost fixnotations?
(Solution:stack)

34) Whatisdatastructureorhowwould youdefinedatastructure?

(Solution: In programming the term data structure refers to a scheme for organizing related
pieceofinformation. Data Structure=Organized Datat+Allowed Operations.)

35) Whichdatastructureswecanimplementusinglinklist?

(Solution:queueand stack)

36) Listdifferenttypesofdatastructures?

(Solution:Linklist queue stack trees files, graphs)

37) Definealinearandnonlineardatastructure.

Linear data structure: A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one
dataelementcan directlybereached. Ex: Arrays,LinkedLists

Non-Linear data structure: Every data item is attached to several other data items in a way that is specific
forreflectingrelationships. Thedata items arenot arrangedin a sequentialstructure. Ex:Trees, Graphs

38) Defineastack?

Ans: Stack is an ordered collection of elements. Insertion and deletion of stack is done only from one
end,calledtop ofthestack .Itis also called LIFO(Lastin firstout)

39) ExplainaQueue?

Ans: Queues are first in first out type(FIFO). New elements are added to the one end called REAR and
theelements are removed from the other end is called FRONT. The people standing in railway reservation
queueisa practical exampleof queue

40)Whatarethedifferent typesofqueuesavailable?

Ans: LinearQueue CircularQueue,PriorityQueue

41) Whatisthe maindifferencebetweenastackand aqueue

Ans: Stack is LIFO and queue is FIFO. In stack insertion and deletion happening from one end(top of
thestack). But in Queue neew elements are added to the one end called REAR and the elements are

removedfromtheotherend iscalledFRONT.
