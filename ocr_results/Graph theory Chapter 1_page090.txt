> Consider a 2-regular graph with n = 5 vertices shown in Figure 1.130.

Evidently, this graph is a Hamilton graph. But the degree of every vertex is 2 which is less
than n/2 and the sum of the degrees of every pair of vertices is 4 which is less than n.
Thus, the converses of Theorems 1 and 2 are not necessarily true.
Let G be a simple graph with n vertices and m edges where m is at least 3. If
m> 5(n- 1)(n- 2) +2, prove that G is a Hamilton graph. Is the converse true?

2 vertices. If this subgraph has q edges,

> Let uv and v be any two non-adjacen
If we delete u, v from G, we get a subgraph with n —
then q < 3(n — 2)(n - 3).*

Since u and v are nonadjacent, m =

Therefore, by Theorem 1, the given graph is a Hamilton graph.
The converse of the result just proved is not always true. Because, a 2-regular graph with

five vertices (shown in Figure 1.130) is Hamiltonian but the inequality does not hold. .

“Recall that in a simple graph of order 1, the number of edges is < in(n -1).
