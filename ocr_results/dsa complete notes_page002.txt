Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module-1

Comparing structures: Return TRUE if employee | and employee 2 are the same
otherwisereturn FALSE

int EmployeeEqual(employee p1, Employee p2)
{
if (!stremp(p1.name, p2.name))
return FALSE;
if (pl.age != p2.age)
return FALSE;
if (pl.salary != p2.salary)
return FALSE;
return TRUE;
i

A typical function call might be:
if (EmployeeEqual(p1,p2))
printf("The two employee are the same\n");
else
printf("The two Employee are not the same\n");

Nested Structure: A structure can be embedded within another structure. That is a structure
canhave another structure as its member such a structure is called a nested structure.

For example, associated with our employee structure we may wish to include the date of Birth of an
employee by using nested stucture

typedef struct {
int month;
int day;
int year;

} date;

typedef struct {
char name[10];
int age;
float salary;
date dob;

}employee;

If we have to store the information of a person we declare a variable as

Employee p1;

A person born on September 10, 1974, would have the values for the date struct set as:
p1.dob.month = 9;
pl.dob.day = 10;
pl.dob.year = 1974;

Array of Structures: In the case of a student or the employee we may not store the details
ofonly 1 student or 1 employee. When we have to store the details of a group of students

we can declare an array of structures.

Example: struct student s[10];
