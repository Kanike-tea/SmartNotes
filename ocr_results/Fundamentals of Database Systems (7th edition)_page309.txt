Q2: {i, k, s, u,v | (Aj)(Gm)(Gn) (Gt) (PROJECT(hijk) AND
EMPLOYEE(qrstuvwxyz) AND DEPARTMENT(/mno) AND k=m AND
n=t AND j="Stafford’)}

Query 6. List the names of employees who have no dependents.

Q6: {q, s | (At)(EMPLOYEE(qrstuvwxyz) AND
(NOT(4I)(DEPENDENT(Imnop) AND t=1)))}

Q6 can be restated using universal quantifiers instead of the existential quantifiers,
as shown in Q6A:

Q6A: {q, s | (At)(EMPLOYEE(qrstuvwxyz) AND
((V)(NOT(DEPENDENT(Imnop)) OR NOT(t=!))))}

Query 7. List the names of managers who have at least one dependent.

az: {s, q | (t)(j) (GD (EMPLOYEE(qrstuvwxyz) AND DEPARTMENT(hijk)
AND DEPENDENT(Imnop) AND t=j AND /=1)}

As we mentioned earlier, it can be shown that any query that can be expressed in
the basic relational algebra can also be expressed in the domain or tuple relational
calculus. Also, any safe expression in the domain or tuple relational calculus can be
expressed in the basic relational algebra.

The QBE language was based on the domain relational calculus, although this was
realized later, after the domain calculus was formalized. QBE was one of the first
graphical query languages with minimum syntax developed for database systems. It
was developed at IBM Research and is available as an IBM commercial product as
part of the Query Management Facility (QMF) interface option to DB2. The basic
ideas used in QBE have been applied in several other commercial products. Because
of its important place in the history of relational languages, we have included an
overview of QBE in Appendix C.

8.8 Summary

In this chapter we presented two formal languages for the relational model of data.
They are used to manipulate relations and produce new relations as answers to que-
ries. We discussed the relational algebra and its operations, which are used to spec-
ify a sequence of operations to specify a query. Then we introduced two types of
relational calculi called tuple calculus and domain calculus.

In Sections 8.1 through 8.3, we introduced the basic relational algebra operations
and illustrated the types of queries for which each is used. First, we discussed the
unary relational operators SELECT and PROJECT, as well as the RENAME operation.
Then, we discussed binary set theoretic operations requiring that relations on
which they are applied be union (or type) compatible; these include UNION,
INTERSECTION, and SET DIFFERENCE. The CARTESIAN PRODUCT operation is a
set operation that can be used to combine tuples from two relations, producing
all possible combinations. It is rarely used in practice; however, we showed how
