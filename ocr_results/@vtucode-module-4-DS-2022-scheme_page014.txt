5.1.1 Introduction

In Koenigsberg, the Pregal river flows around the island of Kneiphof. There are four land areas,
labelled A through D in Figure 6.1, that have this river on their border. Seven bridges, labelled
a through g, connect the land areas. The Koenigsberg bridge problem is as follows: Starting at
some land area, is it possible to return to our starting location after walking across each of the

bridges exactly once?
A possible walk might be:

e start from Jand area B

e walk across bridge a to island A
e take bridge e to area D

e take bridge gto C

e take bridge dtoA

e take bridge b to B

e take bridge f to D

This walk does not cross all bridges exactly once, nor does it return to the starting land area

B.

Euler solved the problem by using a graph (actually a multigraph) in which the land areas
are vertices and the bridges are edges. His solution is not only elegant, it applies to all

graphs.
