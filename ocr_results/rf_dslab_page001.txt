Develop a Program in C for the following:
a) Declare a calendar as an array of 7 elements (A dynamically Created array) to represent
7 days of a week. Each Element of the array is a structure having three fields. The first
field is the name of the Day (A dynamically allocated String), The second field is the

1 1 date of the Day (A integer), the third field is the description of the activity for a CO1,CO2
particular day (A dynamically allocated String).
b) Write functions create(), read() and display(); to create the calendar, to read the data
from the keyboard and to print weeks activity details report on screen.
Develop a Program in C for the following operations on Strings.
a. Read a main String (STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP)
b. Perform Pattern Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in STR

2 2 vad REP if PAT exists in STR. Report suitable messages in case PAT does not exist in CO1,C03
Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Don't use Built-in
functions.
Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on STACK of Integers
(Array Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX)
a. Push an Element on to Stack
b. Pop an Element from Stack
c. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome

3 3 d. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack CO1,CO4
e. Display the status of Stack
f. Exit
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations
Develop a Program in C for converting an Infix Expression to Postfix Expression.
Program should support for both parenthesized and free parenthesized

4 4 expressions with the operators: +, -, *, /, % (Remainder), (Power) and alphanumeric CO1,CO4
operands.
Develop a Program in C for the following Stack Applications
a. Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators: +, -, *,/, %,”

5 5 b. Solving Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks CO1,C04
Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Circular QUEUE of
Characters (Array Implementation of Queue with maximum size MAX)

6 6 a. Insert an Element on to Circular QUEUE CO1,CO2
b. Delete an Element from Circular QUEUE
c. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Circular QUEUE
