19.3 Use of Selectivities in Cost-Based Optimization

does not have any limit and there is no definitive convergence. It is difficult
to conduct this in a space-efficient manner.

It is necessary to resort to some quantitative measure for evaluation of alter-
natives. By using the space and time requirements and reducing them to
some common metric called cost, it is possible to devise some methodology
for optimization.

Appropriate search strategies can be designed by keeping the cheapest alter-
natives and pruning the costlier alternatives.

The scope of query optimization is generally a query block. Various table
and index access paths, join permutations (orders), join methods, group-by
methods, and so on provide the alternatives from which the query optimizer
must chose.

In a global query optimization, the scope of optimization is multiple query
blocks.”

19.3.1 Cost Components for Query Execution

The cost of executing a query includes the following components:

1

. Access cost to secondary storage. This is the cost of transferring (reading

and writing) data blocks between secondary disk storage and main mem-
ory buffers. This is also known as disk I/O (input/output) cost. The cost of
searching for records in a disk file depends on the type of access struc-
tures on that file, such as ordering, hashing, and primary or secondary
indexes. In addition, factors such as whether the file blocks are allocated
contiguously on the same disk cylinder or scattered on the disk affect the
access cost.

. Disk storage cost. This is the cost of storing on disk any intermediate files

that are generated by an execution strategy for the query.

. Computation cost. This is the cost of performing in-memory operations on

the records within the data buffers during query execution. Such operations
include searching for and sorting records, merging records for a join or a
sort operation, and performing computations on field values. This is also
known as CPU (central processing unit) cost.

. Memory usage cost. This is the cost pertaining to the number of main

memory buffers needed during query execution.

. Communication cost. This is the cost of shipping the query and its results

from the database site to the site or terminal where the query originated.
In distributed databases (see Chapter 23), it would also include the cost of
transferring tables and results among various computers during query
evaluation.
