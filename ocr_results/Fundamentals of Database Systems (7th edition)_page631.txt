Indexing Structures for Files and
Physical Database Design

n this chapter, we assume that a file already exists with

some primary organization such as the unordered,
ordered, or hashed organizations that were described in Chapter 16. We will
describe additional auxiliary access structures called indexes, which are used to
speed up the retrieval of records in response to certain search conditions. The index
structures are additional files on disk that provide secondary access paths, which
provide alternative ways to access the records without affecting the physical place-
ment of records in the primary data file on disk. They enable efficient access to
records based on the indexing fields that are used to construct the index. Basically,
any field of the file can be used to create an index, and multiple indexes on different
fields—as well as indexes on multiple fields—can be constructed on the same file. A
variety of indexes are possible; each of them uses a particular data structure to speed
up the search. To find a record or records in the data file based on a search condi-
tion on an indexing field, the index is searched, which leads to pointers to one or
more disk blocks in the data file where the required records are located. The most
prevalent types of indexes are based on ordered files (single-level indexes) and use
tree data structures (multilevel indexes, B*-trees) to organize the index. Indexes can
also be constructed based on hashing or other search data structures. We also dis-
cuss indexes that are vectors of bits called bitmap indexes.

We describe different types of single-level ordered indexes—primary, secondary,
and clustering—in Section 17.1. By viewing a single-level index as an ordered file,
one can develop additional indexes for it, giving rise to the concept of multilevel
indexes. A popular indexing scheme called ISAM (indexed sequential access
method) is based on this idea. We discuss multilevel tree-structured indexes in Sec-
tion 17.2. In Section 17.3, we describe B-trees and B*-trees, which are data struc-
tures that are commonly used in DBMSs to implement dynamically changing
