Polynomials Polynomial
Representation

We should be able to represent any number of different polynomials as long as memory is available.
In general, A polynomial is represented as :

A(K)= amt X feet aox’
where the aj are nonzero coefficients and the e' are nonnegative integer exponents such that
em-1 >em-2)>.........0.......00+- >el>e020.

We represent each term as a NODE containing coefficient and exponent fields, as well as a pointer
to the next term. Assuming that the coefficients are integers, the type declarations are:

struct polyNode {
int coef;
int expon;
struct polyNode * link;
b
Typedef struct polyNode POLY;

A polyNODE can be drawn as

coef expon | link
