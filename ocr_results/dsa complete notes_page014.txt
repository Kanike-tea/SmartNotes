for(i=0;i<n;i++)
printf("%d \t" a[i]);
return(0);

}

Complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n?)
e The time for sorting is measured in terms of the number of comparisons. In the bubble sort
there are n-1 comparison in the first pass which places the largest element in the last position.
e There are n-2 comparison in the second pass which places the second largest element in the
next to last position and so on, therefore
C(n)= (n-1) +(n-2) + 2+ 1= n(n-1)/2= n?/2 = O(n)

Searching:
e Let DATA be a collection of data elements in memory and suppose a specific ITEM of
information is given.
e Searching refers to the operation of finding the Location LOC of the ITEM in DATA or
printing a message that the item does not appear here.
e The search is successful if the ITEM appear in DATA and unsuccessful otherwise.

The algorithm chosen for searching depends on the way the data is organised. The two algorithm
considered here is linear search and binary search.

LINEAR SEARCH: This program traverses the array sequentially to locate key
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
void main()
{
int a[10],i,key,pos.n.flag=0;
printf("enter the size of the array : ");
scanf("%d" ,&n);
printf("enter the elements of the array\n");
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
scanf("%d" &ali]);
printf("enter the key \n");
scanf("%d" &key);
for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
if (a[i]== key)
{
printf("key %d found at %d" key,pos+1);
exit();

}
printf("key not found");
i

Complexity of Linear search: The complexity is based on the number of comparison C(n) required
to find the key in the array element.
e The best case occurs when the key is found at first position. C(n)<¢O(1)
