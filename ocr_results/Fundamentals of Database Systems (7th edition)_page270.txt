Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus

query language for RDBMSs. Although most commercial RDBMSs in use today
do not provide user interfaces for relational algebra queries, the core operations
and functions in the internal modules of most relational systems are based on
relational algebra operations. We will define these operations in detail in Sec-
tions 8.1 through 8.4 of this chapter.

Whereas the algebra defines a set of operations for the relational model, the
relational calculus provides a higher-level declarative language for specifying rela-
tional queries. In a relational calculus expression, there is no order of operations to
specify how to retrieve the query result—only what information the result should
contain. This is the main distinguishing feature between relational algebra and rela-
tional calculus. The relational calculus is important because it has a firm basis in
mathematical logic and because the standard query language (SQL) for RDBMSs
has some of its foundations in a variation of relational calculus known as the tuple
relational calculus."

The relational algebra is often considered to be an integral part of the relational data
model. Its operations can be divided into two groups. One group includes set oper-
ations from mathematical set theory; these are applicable because each relation is
defined to be a set of tuples in the formal relational model (see Section 5.1). Set
operations include UNION, INTERSECTION, SET DIFFERENCE, and CARTESIAN
PRODUCT (also known as CROSS PRODUCT). The other group consists of opera-
tions developed specifically for relational databases—these include SELECT,
PROJECT, and JOIN, among others. First, we describe the SELECT and PROJECT
operations in Section 8.1 because they are unary operations that operate on single
relations. Then we discuss set operations in Section 8.2. In Section 8.3, we discuss
JOIN and other complex binary operations, which operate on two tables by com-
bining related tuples (records) based on join conditions. The COMPANY relational
database shown in Figure 5.6 is used for our examples.

Some common database requests cannot be performed with the original relational
algebra operations, so additional operations were created to express these requests.
These include aggregate functions, which are operations that can summarize data
from the tables, as well as additional types of JOIN and UNION operations, known as
OUTER JOINs and OUTER UNIONs. These operations, which were added to the origi-
nal relational algebra because of their importance to many database applications,
are described in Section 8.4. We give examples of specifying queries that use rela-
tional operations in Section 8.5. Some of these same queries were used in Chap-
ters 6 and 7. By using the same query numbers in this chapter, the reader can contrast
how the same queries are written in the various query languages.

In Sections 8.6 and 8.7 we describe the other main formal language for relational
databases, the relational calculus. There are two variations of relational calculus.
The tuple relational calculus is described in Section 8.6 and the domain relational
calculus is described in Section 8.7. Some of the SQL constructs discussed in

‘SQL is based on tuple relational calculus, but also incorporates some of the operations from the
relational algebra and its extensions, as illustrated in Chapters 6, 7, and 9.
