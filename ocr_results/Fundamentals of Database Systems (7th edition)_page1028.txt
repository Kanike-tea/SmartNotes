Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

The representation of the multimedia object in an object model is extremely impor-
tant. One approach is to divide the image into homogeneous segments using a
homogeneous predicate. For example, in a colored image, adjacent cells that have
similar pixel values are grouped into a segment. The homogeneity predicate defines
conditions for automatically grouping those cells. Segmentation and compression
can hence identify the main characteristics of an image. Another approach finds
measurements of the object that are invariant to transformations. It is impossible to
keep a database of examples of all the different transformations of an image. To deal
with this, object recognition approaches find interesting points (or features) in an
image that are invariant to transformations.

An important contribution to this field was made by Lowe,*° who used scale-invari-
ant features from images to perform reliable object recognition. This approach is
called scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). The SIFT features are invariant to
image scaling and rotation, and partially invariant to change in illumination and
3D camera viewpoint. They are well localized in both the spatial and frequency
domains, reducing the probability of disruption by occlusion, clutter, or noise. In
addition, the features are highly distinctive, which allows a single feature to be cor-
rectly matched with high probability against a large database of features, providing
a basis for object and scene recognition.

For image matching and recognition, SIFT features (also known as keypoint fea-
tures) are first extracted from a set of reference images and stored in a database.
Object recognition is then performed by comparing each feature from the new
image with the features stored in the database and finding candidate matching fea-
tures based on the Euclidean distance of their feature vectors. Since the keypoint
features are highly distinctive, a single feature can be correctly matched with good
probability in a large database of features.

In addition to SIFT, there are a number of competing methods available for object
recognition under clutter or partial occlusion. For example, RIFT, a rotation invari-
ant generalization of SIFT, identifies groups of local affine regions (image features
having a characteristic appearance and elliptical shape) that remain approximately
affinely rigid across a range of views of an object, and across multiple instances of
the same object class.

26.4.3 Semantic Tagging of Images

The notion of implicit tagging is an important one for image recognition and com-
parison. Multiple tags may attach to an image or a subimage: for instance, in the
example we referred to above, tags such as “tiger,” “jungle,” “green,” and “stripes”
may be associated with that image. Most image search techniques retrieve images
based on user-supplied tags that are often not very accurate or comprehensive. To
improve search quality, a number of recent systems aim at automated generation of
these image tags. In case of multimedia data, most of its semantics is present in its
