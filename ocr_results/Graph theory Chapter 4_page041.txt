By examining the graph in Figure’4.64 of the ‘Table
possible couple-sets: -

above, ‘we find the: following: five

Set 1: . (1, g1), (b, 82), (b3, 23) ‘
Set 2: » (b1, 21), (62, 24), (635. 92)
Set 3: (bi; 21), (bp, 84), (b3; 93)
Set'4: (bi, g3), (b2, g4), (bs, 82)
Set5: (br, g4), (br, £2), (bs, g3) “a

Consider the bipartite graph shown below. If four edges of this graph are chosen
at random, what is the probability that they form a complete matching from V, to V2?

Figure 4.65

» Inthe graph, there are 8 edges. Of these, 4 edges can be choosen in 8c, ways. Also, there
ae 5 complete matchings in the graph, each consisting of 4 edges, namely

M, = {AP, BS, CT, DQ}, Mz = {AP, BS, CT; DR};
“ M3 = (AQ, BP, CT, DR}, “M4'= {AQ, BP, CT, DS}; Ms = {AQ, BS, CT, DR).

Therefore, if 4 edges are chosen; the probability that they form a complete matching is *

Retuming to the general discussion, we remark that the Hall’s criterion in Theorem 1 is too
Very tedious to verify if the sets V; and V2 have very large number of vertices. The following

“orem gives a simpler sufficient condition for the existence of a complete matching.
Theorem 2 + Given a bipartite graph G(V1, V2; E), if there is a positive integer m such that the

Bee of every vertex in V > m 2 the degree of every vertex in V2, then there exists a complete

Matching from Vi to V2,
