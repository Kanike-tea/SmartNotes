Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) is the lateral part of the nervous system that develops from the
central nervous system which connects different parts of the body with the CNS. We carry out both
voluntary and involuntary actions with the help of peripheral nerves.

Classification of the peripheral nervous system:

1. Somatic neural system (SNS): It is the neural system that controls the voluntary actions in
the body by transmitting impulses from CNS to skeletal muscle cells. It consists of the
somatic nerves.

2. Autonomic neural system (ANS): The autonomic neural system is involved in involuntary
actions like regulation of physiological functions (digestion, respiration, salivation, etc.).
It is a self-regulating system which conveys the impulses from the CNS to the smooth
muscles and involuntary organs (heart, bladder and pupil). The autonomic neural system
can be further divided into:

e Sympathetic nervous system

e Parasympathetic nervous system

The sympathetic system controls “fight-or-flight” responses. In other words, this system prepares
the body for strenuous physical activity. The events that we would expect to occur within the body
to allow this to happen do, in fact, occur. The parasympathetic system regulates “rest and digest”
functions. In other words, this system controls basic bodily functions while one is sitting quietly
reading a book.

Signal Transmission

Signal transmission in the brain occurs through the firing of nerve cells, or neurons. A
neuron receives inputs from other neurons at its dendrites, integrates the information, and then
generates an electrical impulse, or action potential, that travels down its axon to the synaptic
terminals. At the synaptic terminals, the neuron releases chemical neurotransmitters, which cross
the synaptic gap and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, leading to the initiation of
another action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.
