In addition to these materials, advanced computer algorithms and machine learning techniques are
also used to improve the accuracy and reliability of the bionic eye technology.

A bionic eye typically works by capturing images with a small camera and transmitting the
information to a processing unit that is attached to the eye. The processing unit then converts the
visual information into electrical signals and sends them to an electrode array that is surgically
implanted onto the retina. The electrodes stimulate the remaining healthy cells in the retina, which
then sends signals to the brain to create the perception of vision.

The restored vision is not perfect, but it can help people with vision loss to perform daily
tasks more easily and safely. The amount and quality of vision that can be restored varies
depending on the individual and the type of bionic eye being used. Some bionic eyes only restore
basic visual shapes and patterns, while others can provide more detailed vision.

The bionic eye is powered by a battery that is typically implanted behind the ear. The
battery is recharged through a device that is held near the eye, which transmits power wirelessly
to the battery. The device is typically rechargeable and can be used for several years before it needs
to be replaced.
