table El and do not belong to table E2. So, applying a selection con

difference is equivalent to applying the selection condition on the individual tables and then
applying set difference. This will reduce the number of comparisons in t

12.

Explanation: Applying individual projections before computing the wu
more optimal than the left expression, i.e. applying projection after the u

Projection operation distributes over the union operation.

Step 1 [PARSING]
What does it do? — Checks for correct attribute names, table names, and the

privileges given to the user who wrote this query. If everything fine, then we can
move on to next stage, Translation

Where do get this information? — Data Dictionary (Systern Catalogue)

Step 2 [TRANSLATION]

What does it do? — Converts the parsed SQL query into its Relational Algebra
equivalent.

TTenane( Opor=10 A Employee Eno=Proj_Assigned.Eno(Employee X
Prof_Assigned))

Step 3 [OPTIMIZER]
‘What does it do? — Tries to develop several alternate relational algebra
expressions for the given RA expression in Step 2.

How does it do? — It uses Data Dictionary (System Catalogue) to get
statistical information about the tables in question

Step 4 [EXECUTION PLAN]
‘What do we have now? — From Step 3, we can have a set of one or few equivalent

Relational Algebra expressions that are equivalent to the RA expression in Step 2.
This is along with the cost (Time as well as Space)

Equivalent Relati E

‘Step 5 [EVALUATION]
‘What does it do? — Calculates the cost involved in executing the query using
every Execution plan that we have derived at the previous step. After

calculation, it chooses best plan among them. And executes the query with the
chosen plan by accessing the database.

OUTPUT
Set of tuples (records) as requested through the Query
