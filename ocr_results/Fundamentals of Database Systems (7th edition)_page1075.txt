= EN: false negative
= TN: true negative

The terms true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative are generally
used in any type of classification tasks to compare the given classification of an
item with the desired correct classification. Using the term hits for the documents
that truly or “correctly” match the user request, we can define recall and precision
as follows:

Recall = |Hits|/|Relevant|
Precision = |Hits|/|Retrieved|

Recall and precision can also be defined in a ranked retrieval setting. Let us assume
that there is one document at each rank position. The recall at rank position i for
document d;! (denoted by r(i)) (d;4 is the retrieved document at position i for
query q) is the fraction of relevant documents from d,! to d;/ in the result set for
the query. Let the set of relevant documents from dj! to d;‘ in that set be S$; with
cardinality | 5; |. Let (|D,| be the size of relevant documents for the query. In this
case,|S; | < |D,|). Then:

Ranked retrieval_recall: r(i) = |S; |/|D4|

The precision at rank position i or document dj! (denoted by p(i)) is the fraction of
documents from d,! to dj‘ in the result set that are relevant:

Ranked_retrieval_precision: p(i) = |§; |/i

Table 27.2 illustrates the p(i), r(i), and average precision (discussed in the next sec-
tion) metrics. It can be seen that recall can be increased by presenting more results
to the user, but this approach runs the risk of decreasing the precision. In the exam-
ple, the number of relevant documents for some query = 10. The rank position and
the relevance of an individual document are shown. The precision and recall value
can be computed at each position within the ranked list as shown in the last two
columns. As we see in Table 27.2, the ranked_retrieval_recall rises monotonically
whereas the precision is prone to fluctuation.
