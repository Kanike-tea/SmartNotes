42 Chapter 2. ARM Processor Fundamentals

2.7.2) ARM9 FAMILY

The ARM9 family was announced in 1997. Because of its five-stage pipeline, the ARM9
processor can run at higher clock frequencies than the ARM7 family. The extra stages
improve the overall performance of the processor. The memory system has been redesigned
to follow the Harvard architecture, which separates the data D and instruction J buses.

The first processor in the ARM9 family was the ARM920T, which includes a separate
D + I cache and an MMU. This processor can be used by operating systems requiring
virtual memory support. ARM922T is a variation on the ARM920T but with half the D + I
cache size.

The ARM940T includes a smaller D + I cache and an MPU. The ARM940T is designed
for applications that do not require a platform operating system. Both ARM920T and
ARM940T execute the architecture v4T instructions.

The next processors in the ARM9 family were based on the ARM9E-S core. This core is
a synthesizable version of the ARM9 core with the E extensions. There are two variations:
the ARM946E-S and the ARM966E-S. Both execute architecture vSTE instructions. They
also support the optional embedded trace macrocell (ETM), which allows a developer to
trace instruction and data execution in real time on the processor. This is important when
debugging applications with time-critical segments.

The ARM946E-S includes TCM, cache, and an MPU. The sizes of the TCM and caches
are configurable. This processor is designed for use in embedded control applications that
require deterministic real-time response. In contrast, the ARM966E does not have the MPU
and cache extensions but does have configurable TCMs.

The latest core in the ARM9 product line is the ARM926EJ-S synthesizable processor
core, announced in 2000. It is designed for use in small portable Java-enabled devices such
as 3G phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The ARM926EJ-S is the first ARM
processor core to include the Jazelle technology, which accelerates Java bytecode execution.
It features an MMU, configurable TCMs, and D + I caches with zero or nonzero wait state
memories.

2.7.3. ARM1O FAMILY

The ARM1O, announced in 1999, was designed for performance. It extends the ARM9
pipeline to six stages. It also supports an optional vector floating-point (VFP) unit, which
adds a seventh stage to the ARM10 pipeline. The VFP significantly increases floating-point
performance and is compliant with the IEEE 754.1985 floating-point standard.

The ARM1020E is the first processor to use an ARMIOE core. Like the ARMOE, it
includes the enhanced E instructions. It has separate 32K D + I caches, optional vector
floating-point unit, and an MMU. The ARM1020E also has a dual 64-bit bus interface for
increased performance.

ARM1026E)J-S is very similar to the ARM926EJ-S but with both MPU and MMU. This
processor has the performance of the ARM10 with the flexibility of an ARM926EJ-S.
