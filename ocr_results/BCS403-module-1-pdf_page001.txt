Database Management System (DBMS)

A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs enabling users to create and

maintain a database. More specifically, The DBMS is a general-purpose software systemthat

facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing

databases among various users and applications.

Defining a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the
data to be stored in the database. The database definition or descriptive information is
stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data.
Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that
is controlled by the DBMS.

Manipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve
specific data, updating the database to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating
reports from the data.

Sharing a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database

simultaneously.

Other important functions provided by the DBMS include protecting the database and maintaining

it over a long period of time.

Protection includes system protectionagainst hardware or software malfunction (or
crashes) and security protectionagainst unauthorized or malicious access.

A typical large database may have a life cycle of many years, so the DBMS must be able to
maintain the database system by allowing the system to evolve as requirements change

over time.

A database together with the DBMS software is referred to as a database system.
