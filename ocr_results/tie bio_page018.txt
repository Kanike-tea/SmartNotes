e The lung acts as a filter against endogenous and exogenous emboli, preventing them
from accessing systemic circulation.

e Pulmonary epithelium forms the first line of defense against inhaled particles.

e Pulmonary endothelial cells are responsible for the uptake, metabolism, and
biotransformation of several exogenous and endogenous substances.

e Pulmonary metabolic capacity is easily saturated, but pulmonary endothelial binding
of some drugs alters their pharmacokinetics.

e Air enters the body through the mouth or nose and quickly moves to the pharynx or
throat. From there, it passes through the larynx, or voice box, and enters the trachea.

e The trachea is a strong tube that contains rings of cartilage that prevent it from
collapsing. Within the lungs, the trachea branches into a left and right bronchus.
These further divide into smaller and

e Smaller branches called bronchioles. The smallest bronchioles end in tiny air sacs.
These are called alveoli.

11. Write a brief note on Kidney as a filtration system.
Answer:

Kidneys remove wastes and extra fluid from the body. Kidneys also remove acid that is
produced by the cells of the body and maintain a healthy balance of water, salts, and
minerals—such as sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium—in the blood. Without this
balance, nerves, muscles, and other tissues in the body may not work normally.
Kidneys also make hormones that help

e Keeps bones strong and healthy.
The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just
below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Healthy kidneys filter about a half cup of
blood every minute, removing wastes and extra water to make urine. The urine flows from
the kidneys to the bladder through two thin tubes of muscle called ureters, one on each side of
the bladder. Your bladder stores urine. Kidneys, ureters, and bladder are part of your urinary
tract.
MECHANISM OF FILTRATION:
Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron
includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step
process: the glomerulus filters blood, and the tubule returns needed substances to your blood
and removes wastes. Each nephron has a glomerulus to filter your blood and a tubule that
returns needed substances to your blood and pulls out additional wastes. Wastes and extra
water become urine.
The glomerulus filters your blood. As blood flows into each nephron, it enters a cluster of
tiny blood vessels—the glomerulus. The thin walls of the glomerulus allow smaller
molecules, wastes, and fluid—mostly water—to pass into the tubule. Larger molecules, such
