By Euler’s formula, we have

r=m-n+2, or m+2=n+r
In view of inequality (ii), this yields

m+2

Wie

m+2< fmt, or r2
In view of inequality (i), this yields

ro3x(Fe)e2, or 6r>5r+12, or r>12.

This is not possible, because G has fewer than 12 regions.

Hence, ever region of G cannot be bounded by at least 5 edges. This means that some
Tegion in G is bounded by at most four edges. '

ENUM ES Show that if a planar graph G of order n.and size m has r regions and k com-
ponents, thenn-m+r=k+,

> Let Hy, Ho,..., Hy be the k components of G. Let the number of vertices, the number of

edges and the number of non-exterior regions in H; be nj, Mj, rj tespectively, i = 1,2,...,k.

The exterior region is the same for all components. Therefore, Yn; = n, Ym; = m, Yn =r-l.

If the exterior region is not considered, then the Euler’s formula applied to Hi; yields

ni -m +r, = 1.

On summation (from i = 1 toi= k), this yields

nom+(r-Y=k or n-m+rake]. 1
