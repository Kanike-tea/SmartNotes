gate forms the logical OR of the three terms. The truth table for F2 is listed in
Table 2.2.

Now consider the possible simplification of the function by applying some of the
identities of Boolean algebra:
F2 = x'y'z + x'yz + xy' = x'z(y' + y) + xy' = x'z + xy'
> The function is reduced to only two terms and can be implemented with gates
as shown in Fig. 2.2(b). It is obvious that the circuit in (b) is simpler than the
one in (a), yet both implement the same function.
> By means of a truth table, it is possible to verify that the two expressions are
equivalent. The simplified expression is equal to 1 when xz = 01 or when xy = 10.
> In general, there are many equivalent representations of a logic function. Finding
the most economic representation of the logic is an important design task.
