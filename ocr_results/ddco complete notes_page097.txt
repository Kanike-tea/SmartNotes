f. RELATIVE ADDRESSING MODE:
In this Addressing Mode EA of an operand is computed by the Index Addressing Mode. This

Addressing Mode uses PC (Program Counter)to store the EA of the next instruction instead of

GPR.

The symbolic representation of this mode is X (PC).Where X is the offset value and PC is the

Program Counter to store the address of the next instruction to beexecuted.

It can be represented as
EA of an operand= X + (PC).
This Addressing Mode is useful to caleulatethe BA of the target memory location.

Effective Address
= Content of Program Counter + Address part of the instruction
