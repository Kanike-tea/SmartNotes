Viva Questions on linear plotting using Matplotlib

Basic Concepts:
1. What is a line plot, and when is it appropriate to use one?
2. How do you import the Matplotlib library in Python for creating line plots?
3. Explain the significance of the plt.plot() function.
Creating Line Plots:
1. Can you provide a simple example of creating a basic line plot using Matplotlib?
2. What are the default values for the x and y axes when using plt.plot() without any
arguments?
3. How do you plot multiple lines on the same graph?
Customization:
1. Explain how to customize the appearance of a line in a plot.
2. What parameters can be used to set the line color, style, and marker?
3. How can you add a legend to a line plot?
Adding Labels and Title:
1. How do you add labels to the x-axis and y-axis in a Matplotlib plot?
2. Explain the purpose of the xlabel, ylabel, and title functions.
3. Can you show how to include mathematical symbols or expressions in axis labels or
titles?
Subplots with Line Plots:
1. Describe the process of creating subplots with line plots.
2. How does the subplot function work, and what parameters does it take?
3. Provide an example of a figure with multiple subplots containing line plots.
Handling Dates on the X-axis:
1. How can you create a line plot with dates on the x-axis?
2. Explain the importance of using the datetime module when working with time series
data.
3. Can you customize the date format on the x-axis?
Saving Line Plots:
1. How can you save a Matplotlib line plot as an image file?
2. Provide examples of different file formats you can use for saving line plots.
Working with Pandas DataFrames:

1. How can you create a line plot directly from a Pandas DataFrame?
