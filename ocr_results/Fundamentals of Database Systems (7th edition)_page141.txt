4.2 Specialization and Generalization

relationship in Figure 4.1. We will explain the d symbol in the circles in Figure 4.1
and additional EER diagram notation shortly.

Figure 4.2 shows a few entity instances that belong to subclasses of the (SECRETARY,
ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN} specialization. Again, notice that an entity that belongs to
a subclass represents the same real-world entity as the entity connected to it in the
EMPLOYEE superclass, even though the same entity is shown twice; for example, e,
is shown in both EMPLOYEE and SECRETARY in Figure 4.2. As the figure suggests,
a superclass/subclass relationship such as EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY somewhat
resembles a 1:1 relationship at the instance level (see Figure 3.12). The main differ-
ence is that in a 1:1 relationship two distinct entities are related, whereas in a super-
class/subclass relationship the entity in the subclass is the same real-world entity as
the entity in the superclass but is playing a specialized role—for example, an
EMPLOYEE specialized in the role of SECRETARY, or an EMPLOYEE specialized in
the role of TECHNICIAN.

There are two main reasons for including class/subclass relationships and special-
izations. The first is that certain attributes may apply to some but not all entities of
