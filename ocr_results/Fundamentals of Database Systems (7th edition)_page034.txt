Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

store images, audio clips, and video streams digitally. These types of files are becom-
ing an important component of multimedia databases. Geographic information
systems (GISs) can store and analyze maps, weather data, and satellite images.
Data warehouses and online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are used in
many companies to extract and analyze useful business information from very large
databases to support decision making. Real-time and active database technology
is used to control industrial and manufacturing processes. And database search
techniques are being applied to the World Wide Web to improve the search for
information that is needed by users browsing the Internet.

To understand the fundamentals of database technology, however, we must start
from the basics of traditional database applications. In Section 1.1 we start by defin-
ing a database, and then we explain other basic terms. In Section 1.2, we provide a
simple UNIVERSITY database example to illustrate our discussion. Section 1.3
describes some of the main characteristics of database systems, and Sections 1.4
and 1.5 categorize the types of personnel whose jobs involve using and interacting
with database systems. Sections 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 offer a more thorough discussion
of the various capabilities provided by database systems and discuss some typical
database applications. Section 1.9 summarizes the chapter.

The reader who desires a quick introduction to database systems can study
Sections 1.1 through 1.5, then skip or browse through Sections 1.6 through 1.8 and
go on to Chapter 2.

1.1 Introduction

Databases and database technology have had a major impact on the growing use of
computers. It is fair to say that databases play a critical role in almost all areas where
computers are used, including business, electronic commerce, social media, engi-
neering, medicine, genetics, law, education, and library science. The word database
is so commonly used that we must begin by defining what a database is. Our initial
definition is quite general.

A database is a collection of related data.' By data, we mean known facts that can
be recorded and that have implicit meaning. For example, consider the names,
telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. Nowadays, this data is
typically stored in mobile phones, which have their own simple database software.
This data can also be recorded in an indexed address book or stored on a hard
drive, using a personal computer and software such as Microsoft Access or Excel.
This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database.

The preceding definition of database is quite general; for example, we may consider
the collection of words that make up this page of text to be related data and hence to

‘We will use the word data as both singular and plural, as is common in database literature; the context
will determine whether it is singular or plural. In standard English, data is used for plural and datum for
singular.
