1.6. Walks and their classification a

If G is a simple graph of order n with dj as the degree of a vertex v; for i=
1,2,..., find the number of paths of length 2 in G.

> Since deg(vi) = dj, the number of edges incident on y; is exactly dj, Of these, every two
edges give a path of length 2 which contains v;. Therefore, there exist C(d;, 2) paths containing
vi. This is tue for i = 1,2,..., Therefore, the total number of paths of length 2 in G is
DE, Cd, 2). a

IfG is a simple graph in which every vertex has degree at least k, prove that G
contains a path of length at least k.

> Consider a path p in G which has a maximum number of vertices, Let u be an end vertex
of p. Then every neighbour of « belongs to p. Since u has at least k neighbours (because its
degree is at least k by what is given) and since G is simple, p must therefore have at least k
vertices other than u. Thus, p is a path of length at least k. a

Find all the cycles present in the graph shown in Figure 1.106.

Figure 1.106

> In the given graph, there are no cycles beginning and ending with the vertices A, C and R.
The cycles beginning and ending with the vertices B, P, Q are

Be3PesQe4B, PesQe4Be3P, Qe4Be3Pe6Q.

But all of these represent one and the same cycle. Thus, there is only one cycle in the graph. =
| Example 7 | Prove the following:

(1) A path with n vertices is of length n — 1.

(2) Ifa cycle has n vertices, it has n edges.

(3) The degree of every vertex in a cycle is two.
