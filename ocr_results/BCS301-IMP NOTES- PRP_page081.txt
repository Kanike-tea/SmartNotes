Experimental unit:

For conducting an experiment, the experimental material is divided into smaller parts and
each part is referred to as anexperimentalunit. The experimental,unit is randomly assigned to
treatment is the experimental unit. The phrase “randomly assigned” is very important in this
definition.

Experiment:

A way of getting an answer to a question which the experimenter wants to know.

Treatment

Different objects or procedures which are to be compared in an experiment are called
treatments.

Sampling unit:

The object that is measured in an experiment is called the sampling unit. This may be different
from the experimental unit.

Factor:

A factor is a variable defining a categorization. A factor can be fixed or random in nature. A
factor is termed as a fixed factor if all the levels of interest are included in the experiment. A
factor is termed as a random factor if all the levels of interest are not included in the experiment
and those that are can be considered to be randomly chosen from all the levels of interest.

Replication:

It is the repetition of the experimental situation by replicating the experimental unit.
