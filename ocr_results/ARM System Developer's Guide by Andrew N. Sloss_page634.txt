A.4 ARM Assembler Quick Reference 621

where

= <instruction> is any ARM or Thumb instruction supported by the processor you are
assembling for. See Section A.3.

=~ </abel> is the name of a symbol to store the address of the instruction.

= = <directive> is an ARM assembler directive. See Section A.4.4.

= ~~ <symbol> is the name of a symbol used by the <directive>.

=~ <macro> is the name of a new directive defined using the MACRO directive.

= = <arg_k> is the kth macro argument.

You must use an AREA directive to define an area before any ARM or Thumb instructions
appear. All assembly files must finish with the END directive. The following example shows a
simple assembly file defining a function add that returns the sum of the two input arguments:

add

AREA maths_routines, CODE, READONLY

EXPORT add 3 give the symbol add external linkage
ADD = r0, 0, rl; add input arguments

MOV pc, Ir 3 return from sub-routine

END

A.4.1 ARM ASSEMBLER VARIABLES

Table A.14

The ARM assembler supports three types of assemble time variables (see Table A.14).
Variable names are case sensitive and must be declared before use with the directives GBLx

or LCLx.

You can use variables in expressions (see Section A.4.2), or substitute their value at
assembly time using the $ operator. Specifically, $name. expands to the value of the variable
