There are two photoreceptors: RODS AND CONES.

Photoreceptors in the retina are classified into two groups, named after their physical
morphologies. Rod cells are highly sensitive to light and function in night vision, whereas
cone cells are capable of detecting a wide spectrum of light photons and are responsible for
colour vision. Rods and cones are structurally compartmentalized. They consist of five
principal regions: Outer segment, connecting cilium, Inner segment, nuclear region, Synaptic
region, Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not
mediate color vision and have a low spatial acuity.

Cones are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), are capable of color vision and are
responsible for high spatial acuity. The central fovea is populated exclusively by cones. There
are 3 types of cones which we will refer to as the short-wavelength sensitive cones, the
middle- wavelength sensitive cones and the long-wavelength sensitive cones or S-cone, M-
cones, and L- cones for short.

The bionic vision system consists of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses, which transmits
high- frequency radio signals to a microchip implanted in the retina. Electrodes on the
implanted chip convert these signals into electrical impulses to stimulate cells in the retina
that connect to the optic nerve.

It is an expensive treatment and not everyone can afford it. b. Since research is still going on
results are yet not 100% successful.

Explain the function of lungs as a purification system.
Answer:

Every cell in your body needs oxygen to live. The air we breathe contains oxygen and other
gases. The respiratory system's main job is to move fresh air into your body while removing
waste gases. Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through
your body. At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon
dioxide.

Lungs help in the purification of blood. Arteries carry pure oxygenated blood from the heart
to other parts of the body. Veins carry impure venous blood back from other parts of the body
to the right side of the heart. This impure blood goes to the lungs for purification.

When the breath is inhaled, oxygen from the air comes in contact with the impure blood and
the blood takes up oxygen. The waste matter in the blood releases carbonic acid and the
blood is purified. The purified blood is carried to the heart by the veins.

The lung parenchyma is mainly comprised of numerous air-containing passages and
intervening fine structures, corresponding to alveolar ductal lumens and alveoli, as well as
alveolar septa and small pulmonary vessels occupying 10% of total parenchymal volume.

The primary function of the lungs is gas exchange. However, the lungs perform several
important non-respiratory functions that are vital for normal physiology.

The lung, with its unique ability to distend and recruit pulmonary vasculature, acts as a
reservoir of blood, fine-tuning preload to the left heart to optimize cardiac output.
