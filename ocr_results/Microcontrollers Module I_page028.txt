a form

of memory called tightly coupled memory (TCM). TCM is fast SRAM located close to

the core and guarantees the clock cycles required to fetch instructions or data—critical for

real-time algorit

address map and

ms requiring deterministic behavior. TCMs appear as memory in the

By combining both technologies, ARM processors can have both improved performance and

predictable real-time response. Figure 12 shows an example core with a combination of

caches

and TCMs.

Memory Management

ARM cores have three different types of memory management hardware:

i)
ii)
iii)

No extensions providing no protection

Memory protection unit (MPU) providing limited protection

Memory management unit (MMU) providing full protection:
Non protected memory is fixed and provides very little flexibility. It is normally used
for small, simple embedded systems that require no protection from rogue
applications.
MPUs employ a simple system that uses a limited number of memory regions. These
regions are controlled with a set of special coprocessor registers, and each region is
defined with specific access permissions. This type of memory management is used
for systems that require memory protection but don’t have a complex memory map.
MMUs are the most comprehensive memory management hardware available on the
ARM. The MMU uses a set of translation tables to provide fine-grained control over
memory. These tables are stored in main memory and provide a virtual-to-physical
address map as well as access permissions. MMUs are designed for more

sophisticated platform operating systems that support multitasking.
