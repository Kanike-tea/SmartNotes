2.5.1. Chromatic Polynomials 141

i) If the vertices a and b are to have different colours, then there are 2 choices for colouring
the vertex a and (A — 1) choices for the vertex b (or vice versa). Consequently, there are
(A - 2) choices for each of the vertices x, y,'z.. Hence the number of proper colourings
(in this case) is A(A — 1)(A - 2)3.

(iii) Since the two cases of the vertices a and b having the same colour or different colours
are exhaustive and mutually exclusive, the chromatic polynomial of the graph is

P(K23, a) = A(A- 17 +a = 1)(a = 2) 5

Find the chromative polynomial for the graph Kn:

> Let Vi = (a,b) and V2 = {x1, x2,.x3,...,n} be the two bipartites of Kan. Then, if a and b
are to have the same colour, the number of proper colourings of K2,n is A(A — 1)", as in case (i)
of Example 4 above. If a and b are to have different colours, the number of proper colourings
is A(A— 1)(A—2)", as in case (ii) of Example 4 above. Consequently, the chromatic polynomial
for Kon is ; ’

P(Kon, a) = AA- 1 + AGAHDA- 2 os

> Acycle of length 4, namely C4, is shown in Figure 2.49: Let us employ the Decomposition
Theorem to obtain its chromatic polynomial.’ For this purpose, let us redesignate C4 as G and
denote the edge {v2, v3} as e. Then the graphs G, and G/, defined in the Decomposition Theorem

would be as shown below.
