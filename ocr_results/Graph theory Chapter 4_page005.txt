41. Minimal Spanning Tree :

Figure 4.8

Oey Using Kruskal’s method, determine a minimal spanning tree for the graph shown
below. :

a 2 b 2 é

Figure 4.9

> The given graph has 9 vertices and therefore a spanning tree thereof will have 8 edges. Let
4S put the edges of the graph in a non-decreasing order of their weights and go on selecting 8
tdges one by one in such'a way that no cycle is created. The scheme is summarized below.

| ek | ab | bce | de | ef | ad be | bf
eine 1] 2 2|2|3 3 | 3 a fas
Setar [ye [es [ves] ven [ves [es [No] wo | wo No [ves ves |_|

Thus, the edges eh, ab, bc, de, ef, ad, dg and hi constitute a minimal spanning tree for the
"graph. The weight of this tree is 18 units. The tree is shown in Figure'4.10.
