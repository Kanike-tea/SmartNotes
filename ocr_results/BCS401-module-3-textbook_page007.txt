FIGURE 6.8 Construction of a 2-3 tree for the list 9, 5, 8, 3, 2, 4, 7.

and hence
h>log,(n+1) —1.
These lower and upper bounds on height h,
logs(n + 1) —1 <h <logy(n + 1) - 1,

imply that the time efficiencies of searching, insertion, and deletion are all in
© (log n) in both the worst and average case. We consider a very important gener-
alization of 2-3 trees, called B-trees, in Section 7.4.
