Enhanced Data Models:
Introduction to Active,
Temporal, Spatial, Multimedia,
and Deductive Databases

A: the use of database systems has grown, users
have demanded additional functionality from
these software packages; increased functionality would make it easier to implement
more advanced and complex user applications. Object-oriented databases and
object-relational systems do provide features that allow users to extend their sys-
tems by specifying additional abstract data types for each application. However, it is
useful to identify certain common features for some of these advanced applications
and to create models that can represent them. Additionally, specialized storage
structures and indexing methods can be implemented to improve the performance
of these common features. Then the features can be implemented as abstract data
types or class libraries and purchased separately from the basic DBMS software
package. The term data blade has been used in Informix and cartridge in Oracle to
refer to such optional submodules that can be included in a DBMS package. Users
can utilize these features directly if they are suitable for their applications, without
having to reinvent, reimplement, and reprogram such common features.

This chapter introduces database concepts for some of the common features that
are needed by advanced applications and are being used widely. We will cover
active rules that are used in active database applications, temporal concepts that
are used in temporal database applications, and, briefly, some of the issues involv-
ing spatial databases and multimedia databases. We will also discuss deductive
databases. It is important to note that each of these topics is very broad, and we give
