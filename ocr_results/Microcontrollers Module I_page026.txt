When an exception or interrupt occurs, the processor suspends normal execution and starts

loading instructions from the exception vector table as in table 2. Each vector table entry

contains a form of branch instruction pointing to the start of a specific routine:

Reset vector is the location of the first instruction executed by the processor when
power is applied. This instruction branches to the initialization code.

Undefined instruction vector is used when the processor cannot decode an
instruction.

Software interrupt vector is called when you execute a SWI instruction. The SWI
instruction is frequently used as the mechanism to invoke an operating system routine.
Pre fetch abort vector occurs when the processor attempts to fetch an instruction from
an address without the correct access permissions. The actual abort occurs in the
decode stage.

Data abort vector is similar to a pre fetch abort but is raised when an instruction
attempts to access data memory without the correct access permissions.

Interrupt request vector is used by external hardware to interrupt the normal
execution flow of the processor. It can only be raised if IRQs are not masked in the
cpsr.

Fast interrupt request vector is similar to the interrupt request but is reserved for
hardware requiring faster response times. It can only be raised if FIQs are not masked

in the cpsr.

6. Core Extensions

The hardware extensions are standard components placed next to the ARM core. They

improve performance, manage resources, and provide extra functionality and are designed to

provide flexibility in handling particular applications. Each ARM family has different

extensions available.
