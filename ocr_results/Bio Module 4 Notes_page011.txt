Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):

Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere enters the stroma of the chloroplasts.

Carbon fixation occurs and forms a unstable six-carbon compound

The resulting unstable six-carbon compound quickly breaks down into two molecules of 3-
phosphoglycerate (PGA).

ATP and NADPH, produced during the light-dependent reactions, provide energy and electrons
for the reduction of PGA to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).

Some G3P molecules are used to produce glucose and other organic molecules.

The remaining G3P molecules are recycled and used in subsequent cycles of the Calvin cycle.

Glucose and other carbohydrates produced during the Calvin cycle can be stored for later use or
utilized in metabolic processes to meet the energy and growth needs of the plant.

Overall, the process of photosynthesis is a critical aspect of life on Earth and provides the
primary source of energy for all living organisms. While the specific details of the process may
differ between plants, algae, and some animals, the basic principle of converting light energy into
usable forms of energy remains the same.

4.2.1 Photovoltaic Cells

The connection between photosynthesis and photovoltaics lies in the conversion of light
energy into usable forms of energy. In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is converted into
chemical energy stored in organic molecules, such as sugars and starches. In photovoltaics, light
energy is converted into electrical energy.

Both photosynthesis and photovoltaics use the same basic principle of converting light
energy into usable forms of energy, but the end products are different. In photosynthesis, the end
product is stored chemical energy, while in photovoltaics, the end product is electrical energy.

However, the similarities between photosynthesis and photovoltaics go beyond just the
conversion of light energy. Both processes also involve the use of specialized components and
materials, such as chlorophyll in photosynthesis and silicon in photovoltaics, to absorb and
convert light energy into usable forms of energy.
