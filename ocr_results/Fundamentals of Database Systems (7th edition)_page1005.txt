26.2 Temporal Database Concepts

In this section, we will introduce some of the concepts that have been developed to deal
with the complexity of temporal database applications. Section 26.2.1 gives an over-
view of how time is represented in databases, the different types of temporal informa-
tion, and some of the different dimensions of time that may be needed. Section 26.2.2
discusses how time can be incorporated into relational databases. Section 26.2.3 gives
some additional options for representing time that are possible in database models that
allow complex-structured objects, such as object databases. Section 26.2.4 introduces
operations for querying temporal databases and gives a brief overview of the TSQL2
language, which extends SQL with temporal concepts. Section 26.2.5 focuses on time
series data, which is a type of temporal data that is very important in practice.

26.2.1 Time Representation, Calendars,
and Time Dimensions

For temporal databases, time is considered to be an ordered sequence of points in
some granularity that is determined by the application. For example, suppose that
some temporal application never requires time units that are less than one second.
Then, each time point represents one second using this granularity. In reality, each
second is a (short) time duration, not a point, since it may be further divided into
milliseconds, microseconds, and so on. Temporal database researchers have used
the term chronon instead of point to describe this minimal granularity for a par-
ticular application. The main consequence of choosing a minimum granularity—
say, one second—is that events occurring within the same second will be considered
to be simultaneous events, even though in reality they may not be.

Because there is no known beginning or ending of time, one needs a reference point
from which to measure specific time points. Various calendars are used by various
cultures (such as Gregorian (Western), Chinese, Islamic, Hindu, Jewish, Coptic, and
so on) with different reference points. A calendar organizes time into different time
units for convenience. Most calendars group 60 seconds into a minute, 60 minutes
into an hour, 24 hours into a day (based on the physical time of earth’s rotation
around its axis), and 7 days into a week. Further groupings of days into months and
months into years either follow solar or lunar natural phenomena and are generally
irregular. In the Gregorian calendar, which is used in most Western countries, days
are grouped into months that are 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, and 12 months are grouped
into a year. Complex formulas are used to map the different time units to one another.

In SQL2, the temporal data types (see Chapter 4) include DATE (specifying Year,
Month, and Day as YYYY-MM-DD), TIME (specifying Hour, Minute, and Second
as HH:MM5SS), TIMESTAMP (specifying a Date/Time combination, with options for
including subsecond divisions if they are needed), INTERVAL (a relative time
duration, such as 10 days or 250 minutes), and PERIOD (an anchored time duration
with a fixed starting point, such as the 10-day period from January 1, 2009, to Jan-
uary 10, 2009, inclusive).!!

"Unfortunately, the terminology has not been used consistently. For example, the term interval is often
used to denote an anchored duration. For consistency, we will use the SQL terminology.
