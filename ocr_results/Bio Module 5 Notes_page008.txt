Axial Skeleton: The axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the
skull, vertebral column, and ribcage. The skull protects the brain, and the vertebral column
(spine) supports the body's weight and houses the spinal cord. The ribcage encloses and protects
the heart, lungs, and other thoracic organs.

Appendicular Skeleton: The appendicular skeleton comprises the bones of the limbs and
the shoulder and pelvic girdles. The upper limbs (arms) consist of the humerus (upper arm bone),
radius and ulna (forearm bones), and the hand bones. The lower limbs (legs) include the femur
(thigh bone), tibia and fibula (lower leg bones), and the foot bones. The shoulder and pelvic
girdles attach the limbs to the axial skeleton.

Joints: Joints are the points where bones meet and allow for movement. There are
different types of joints, including hinge joints (e.g., elbow and knee) that enable bending and
straightening, ball-and-socket joints (e.g., hip and shoulder) that allow for a wide range of
motion, and pivot joints (e.g., between the atlas and axis vertebrae) that allow rotational
movement.
