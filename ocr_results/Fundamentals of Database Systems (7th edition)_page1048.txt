1018 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

26.44. Consider the following rules:
REACHABLE(X, Y) :— FLIGHT(X, Y)
REACHABLE(X, Y) :— FLIGHT(X, Z), REACHABLE(Z, Y)

where REACHABLE(X, Y) means that city Y can be reached from city X, and
FLIGHT(X, Y) means that there is a flight to city Y from city X.

a.

Construct fact predicates that describe the following:

Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore,
Sydney are cities.

The following flights exist: LA to NY, NY to Atlanta, Atlanta to Frankfurt,
Frankfurt to Atlanta, Frankfurt to Singapore, and Singapore to Sydney.
(Note: No flight in reverse direction can be automatically assumed.)

. Is the given data cyclic? If so, in what sense?
. Construct a model-theoretic interpretation (that is, an interpretation

similar to the one shown in Figure 26.13) of the above facts and rules.

. Consider the query

REACHABLE (Atlanta, Sydney)?
How will this query be executed? List the series of steps it will go through.

. Consider the following rule-defined predicates:

ROUND-TRIP-REACHABLE(X, Y) :—
REACHABLE(X, Y), REACHABLE(Y, X)
DURATION(X, Y, Z)

Draw a predicate dependency graph for the above predicates. (Note:
DURATION(X, Y, Z) means that you can take a flight from X to Y in Z hours.)
Consider the following query: What cities are reachable in 12 hours from
Atlanta? Show how to express it in Datalog. Assume built-in predicates
like greater-than(X, Y). Can this be converted into a relational algebra
statement in a straightforward way? Why or why not?

. Consider the predicate population(X, Y), where Y is the population of

city X. Consider the following query: List all possible bindings of the
predicate pair (X, Y), where Y is a city that can be reached in two flights
from city X, which has over 1 million people. Show this query in Datalog.
Draw a corresponding query tree in relational algebraic terms.

Selected Bibliography

The book by Zaniolo et al. (1997) consists of several parts, each describing an advanced
database concept such as active, temporal, and spatial/text/multimedia databases.
Widom and Ceri (1996) and Ceri and Fraternali (1997) focus on active database concepts
and systems. Snodgrass (1995) describes the TSQL2 language and data model. Khosha-
fian and Baker (1996), Faloutsos (1996), and Subrahmanian (1998) describe multimedia
database concepts. Tansel et al. (1993) is a collection of chapters on temporal databases.
The temporal extensions to SQL:2011 are discussed in Kulkarni and Michels (2012).
