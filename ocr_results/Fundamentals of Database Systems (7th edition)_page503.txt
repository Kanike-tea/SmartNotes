14.2 Functional Dependencies

dependencies may cease to exist in the real world if the relationship changes. For
example, the FD Zip_code > Area_code used to exist as a relationship between postal
codes and telephone number codes in the United States, but with the proliferation
of telephone area codes it is no longer true.

Consider the relation schema EMP_PROJ in Figure 14.3(b); from the semantics of
the attributes and the relation, we know that the following functional dependencies
should hold:

a. Ssn > Ename
b. Pnumber — {Pname, Plocation}

c. {Ssn, Pnumber} —> Hours

These functional dependencies specify that (a) the value of an employee’s Social
Security number (Ssn) uniquely determines the employee name (Ename), (b) the
value of a project’s number (Pnumber) uniquely determines the project name
(Pname) and location (Plocation), and (c) a combination of Ssn and Pnumber values
uniquely determines the number of hours the employee currently works on the
project per week (Hours). Alternatively, we say that Ename is functionally deter-
mined by (or functionally dependent on) Ssn, or given a value of Ssn, we know the
value of Ename, and so on.

A functional dependency is a property of the relation schema R, not of a particular
legal relation state r of R. Therefore, an FD cannot be inferred automatically from a
given relation extension r but must be defined explicitly by someone who knows
the semantics of the attributes of R. For example, Figure 14.7 shows a particular
state of the TEACH relation schema. Although at first glance we may think that
Text > Course, we cannot confirm this unless we know that it is true for all possible
legal states of TEACH. It is, however, sufficient to demonstrate a single counterexam-
ple to disprove a functional dependency. For example, because ‘Smith’ teaches both
‘Data Structures’ and “Database Systems,’ we can conclude that Teacher does not
functionally determine Course.

Given a populated relation, we cannot determine which FDs hold and which do not
unless we know the meaning of and the relationships among the attributes. All we can
say is that a certain FD may exist if it holds in that particular extension. We cannot
guarantee its existence until we understand the meaning of the corresponding attri-
butes. We can, however, emphatically state that a certain FD does not hold if there are
