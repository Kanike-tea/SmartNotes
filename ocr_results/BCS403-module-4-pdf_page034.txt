Database Management System [BCS403]

+ For example, data for the transaction may not be found

4. Concurrency control enforcement:

+The concurrency control may decide to abort a transaction because itviolates

serializability or several transactions are in a state of deadlock

5. Disk failure:

« Some disk blocks may lose their data because of a read or write malfunction or

because of a disk read/write head crash.

6. Physical problems and catastrophes:

refers to an endless list of problems that includes power or air-conditioning failure, fire,

theft, overwriting disks or tapes by mistake

= Failures of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 are more common than those of types.5 or 6.

= Whenever a failure of type 1 through 4 occurs, the system must keep sufficient information to

quickly recover from the failure.

= Disk failure or other catastrophic failures of type 5 or 6 do not happen frequently; if they do

occur, recovery is a major task.

5.3 Transaction and System Concepts

5.3.1 Transaction States and/Additional.Operations

A transaction is an atomic unit of work that should either be completed in its entirety or
not done atiall. For recovery purposes, the system keeps track of start of a transaction,
termination, commit or aborts:

BEGIN_TRANSACTION: marks the beginning of transaction execution

READ or WRITE: specify read or write operations on the database items that are

executed as part of a transaction

END_TRANSACTION: specifies that READ and WRITE transaction operations have
ended and marks the end of transaction execution

COMMIT_TRANSACTION: signals a successful end of the transaction so that any

changes (updates) executed by the transaction can be safely committed to the

database and will not be undone

ROLLBACK: signals that the transaction has ended unsuccessfully, so that any
changes or effects that the transaction may have applied to the database must be

undone
