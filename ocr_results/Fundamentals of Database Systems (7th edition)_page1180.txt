Chapter 30 Database Security

With this background, we adhere to following standard definitions:”

= Ciphertext: Encrypted (enciphered) data

= Plaintext (or cleartext): Intelligible data that has meaning and can be read or
acted upon without the application of decryption

= Encryption: The process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext
= Decryption: The process of transforming ciphertext back into plaintext

Encryption consists of applying an encryption algorithm to data using some pre-
specified encryption key. The resulting data must be decrypted using a decryption
key to recover the original data.

30.7.1 The Data Encryption and Advanced
Encryption Standards

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a system developed by the U.S. govern-
ment for use by the general public. It has been widely accepted as a cryptographic
standard both in the United States and abroad. DES can provide end-to-end
encryption on the channel between sender A and receiver B. The DES algorithm
is a careful and complex combination of two of the fundamental building blocks
of encryption: substitution and permutation (transposition). The algorithm
derives its strength from repeated application of these two techniques for a total
of 16 cycles. Plaintext (the original form of the message) is encrypted as blocks of
64 bits. Although the key is 64 bits long, in effect the key can be any 56-bit num-
ber. After questioning the adequacy of DES, the NIST introduced the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES). This algorithm has a block size of 128 bits, com-
pared with DES’s 56-block size, and can use keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits, com-
pared with DES’s 56-bit key. AES introduces more possible keys, compared with
DES, and thus takes a much longer time to crack. In present systems, AES is the
default with large key lengths. It is also the standard for full drive encryption
products, with both Apple FileVault and Microsoft BitLocker using 256-bit or
128-bit keys. TripleDES is a fallback option if a legacy system cannot use a mod-
ern encryption standard.

30.7.2 Symmetric Key Algorithms

A symmetric key is one key that is used for both encryption and decryption. By
using a symmetric key, fast encryption and decryption is possible for routine
use with sensitive data in the database. A message encrypted with a secret key can
be decrypted only with the same secret key. Algorithms used for symmetric
key encryption are called secret key algorithms. Since secret-key algorithms
are mostly used for encrypting the content of a message, they are also called
content-encryption algorithms.
