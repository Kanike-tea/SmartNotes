Database Management System [BCS403]

Example :

1. To list each employee’s first and last name and salary we can use the PROJECT operation as
follows:

7ULname, Fname, Salar(/EMPLOYEE)

If the attribute list includes only nonkey attributes of R, duplicate tuples are likely to
occur. The result of the PROJECT operation is a set of distinct tuples, and hence a valid
relation. This is known as duplicate elimination.For example, consider the following
PROJECT operation:

Tegender, Salary(/ EMPLOYEE)

Lname | Fname | Salary
Smith | John 30000
Wong | Franklin | 40000
Zelaya _| Alicia | 25000
Wallace | Jennifer | 43000
Narayan | Ramesh | 38000
English | Joyce | 25000
Jabbar | Ahmad | 25000
Borg | James | (5000

The tuple <‘F’, 25000> appears only once in resulting relation even though this combination of
values appears twice in the EMPLOYEE relation.
The number of tuples in a relation resulting from a PROJECT operation is always less than or equal
to the number of tuples in R. Commutativity does not hold on PROJECT
Teatisti> (tt<1ist2>(R)) = taisti>(R)
as long as <list2> contains the attributes in <list>; otherwise, the left-hand side is an incorrect
expression.
In SQL, the PROJECT attribute list is specified in the SELECT clause of a query. For example, the
following operation:
Tgender, Salary(/ EMPLOYEE)
would correspond to the following SQL query:
SELECT DISTINCT gender, Salary FROM EMPLOYEE
