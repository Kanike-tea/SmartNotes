Database Management System [8CS403)

5.2.2 Transactions, Database Items, Read and Write Operations, and DBMS

Buffers
= A Transaction an executing program that forms a logical unit of database processing
= It includes one or more DB access operations such as insertion, deletion, modification or
retrieval operation.
= It can be either embedded within an application program using begin transaction and
end transaction statements Or specified interactively via a high level query language
such as SQL
= Transaction which do not update database are known as read only transactions.
= Transaction which do update database are known as read write transactions.
= A database is basically represented as a collection of named data items The size of a
data item is called its granularity.
= A data item can be a database record, but it can also be a larger unit such as a whole
disk block, or even a smaller unit such as an individual field (attribute) value of some
record in the database
= Each data item has a unique name
= Basic DB access operations that a transaction can include are:
+ read_item(X): Reads a DB item named.X into a program variable.
+ write_item(X): Writes the value of a program variable into the DB item named X
= Executing read_item(X) include the following steps:
1. Find the address of the disk block that contains item X
2. Copy the block into a buffer in main memory
3. Copy the item X from the buffer to program variable named X.
= Executing write_item(X) include the following steps:
1. Find the address of the disk block that contains item X
2. Copy the disk block into a buffer in main memory
3. Copy item X from program variable named X into its correct location in buffer.
4. Store the updated disk block from buffer back to disk (either immediately or later).
= Decision of when to store a modified disk block is handled by recovery manager of the
DBMS in cooperation with operating system.
= ADB cache includes a number of data buffers.
= When the buffers are all occupied a buffer replacement policy is used to choose one of
the buffers to be replaced. EG: LRU
