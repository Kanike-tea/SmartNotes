the known functional requirements of the application. These consist of the user-
defined operations (or transactions) that will be applied to the database, including
both retrievals and updates. In software design, it is common to use data flow dia-
grams, sequence diagrams, scenarios, and other techniques to specify functional
requirements. We will not discuss any of these techniques here; they are usually

described in detail in software engineering texts.

Once the requirements have been collected and analyzed, the next step is to create a
conceptual schema for the database, using a high-level conceptual data model. This
