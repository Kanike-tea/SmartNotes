Database Management System [BCS403]

Value sets are not displayed in ER diagrams, and are specified using the basic data types
available in most programming languages, such as integer, string, Boolean, float, enumerated type,
subrange, and so on.

Mathematically, an attribute A of entity set E whose value set is V can be defined as a function
from E to the power set P(V) of V: A : E > P(V).We refer to the value of attribute A for entity e
as A(e).A NULL value is represented by the empty set.

3.3 A Sample Database Application

Miniworld : COMPANY database keeps track of a company’s employees, departments, and

projects.

» After the requirements collection and analysis phase, the database designers provide the
following description of the miniworld:

= The company is organized into departments.

« Each department has a unique name, a unique number, and a particular employee who
manages the department.We keep track of the start date when that employee began
managing the department. A department may have several locations.

= A department controls a number of projects; each of which has a unique name, a unique
number, and a single location.

= We store each employee’s name, Social Security number, address, salary, gender, and birth
date.

« An-employee is assigned to one department, but may work on several projects, which are
not necessarily controlled by the same department.

= We keep track of the current number of hours per week that an employee works on each
project. We also keep track of the direct supervisor of each employee (who is another
employee).

= We want to keep track of the dependents of each employee for insurance purposes. We

keep each dependent’s first name, gender, birth date, and relationship to the employee.
