Marginal Probability Distributions:
In the joint probability table f(x), f (x2), f(x3),.- of (Xm) and g (V1), 902), 9(3)) +010 GWn) are
called the marginal probability distributions respectively and represents the sum of all entries in all the rows

and columns.

Independent Random Variables:
The discrete random variables X and Y are said to be independent if,
P(X =x, Y = yj) = P(X =x;).P(Y =y;), _ for every i, j and it is equivalent to
P(X =x, Y = yj) = P(X = xj). PY = yj) = f(xi). Gj) Or COV(X,Y) = 0

Expectation, Variance & Covariance:
Let X be the random variable taking the random values x,, x2, x3,....
function f (x). Then,

-Xm , having the probability

a) The expectation of X is denoted by E(X) and is defined as, wy = E(X) = D7, xif (x)
b) The expectation of Y is denoted by E(Y) and is defined as, uy = E(Y) = i=1 Vif 0%)
c) The variance of X is denoted by ox? and.is defined as ay? = E(X*) — [E(X)]?

PROBLEMS

1) The joint distribution of two random variables X and Y are as follows:
Y -4 2 7
xX
1 V/, 1, VY,
5 Vy Vy Vy

Compute the following,
i) E(X) and E(Y)
ii) E(XY)
iii) oy & oy
iv) p(X)
Sol": Given,

= 1% =5,y=—-4, y2=2, y3=7
And the probabilities are

1 1 1 1 1 1
Pir = 3» Piz = 4g) P13 = g Pai = 4g P22 = g Pas = 3
Given the joint probability distribution is follows as
