Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

general definitions of second normal form (2NF) and third normal form (3NF) that
take all candidate keys of a relation into account. We presented examples to illus-
trate how, by using the general definition of 3NF, a given relation may be analyzed
and decomposed to eventually yield a set of relations in 3NF.

We presented Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) and discussed how it is a stronger
form of 3NF. We also illustrated how the decomposition of a non-BCNF relation
must be done by considering the nonadditive decomposition requirement. We pre-
sented a test for the nonadditive join property of binary decompositions and also
gave a general algorithm to convert any relation not in BCNF into a set of BCNF
relations. We motivated the need for an additional constraint beyond the functional
dependencies based on mixing of independent multivalued attributes into a single
relation. We introduced multivalued dependency (MVD) to address such condi-
tions and defined the fourth normal form based on MVDs. Finally, we introduced
the fifth normal form, which is based on join dependency and which identifies a
peculiar constraint that causes a relation to be decomposed into several compo-
nents so that they always yield the original relation after a join. In practice, most
commercial designs have followed the normal forms up to BCNF. The need to
decompose into 5NF rarely arises in practice, and join dependencies are difficult to
detect for most practical situations, making 5NF more of theoretical value.

Chapter 15 presents synthesis as well as decomposition algorithms for relational
database design based on functional dependencies. Related to decomposition, we
discuss the concepts of nonadditive (or lossless) join and dependency preservation,
which are enforced by some of these algorithms. Other topics in Chapter 15 include
a more detailed treatment of functional and multivalued dependencies, and other
types of dependencies.

Discuss attribute semantics as an informal measure of goodness for a rela-
tion schema.

Discuss insertion, deletion, and modification anomalies. Why are they con-
sidered bad? Illustrate with examples.

Why should NULLs in a relation be avoided as much as possible? Discuss the
problem of spurious tuples and how we may prevent it.

State the informal guidelines for relation schema design that we discussed.
Illustrate how violation of these guidelines may be harmful.

What is a functional dependency? What are the possible sources of the
information that defines the functional dependencies that hold among the
attributes of a relation schema?

Why can we not infer a functional dependency automatically from a partic-
ular relation state?
