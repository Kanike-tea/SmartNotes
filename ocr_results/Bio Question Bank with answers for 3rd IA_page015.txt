The denticles on shark skin have evolved over millions of years to reduce drag and increase
swimming efficiency. These structures disrupt the flow of water around the shark's body,
reducing turbulence and minimizing the formation of vortices. As a result, sharks can swim

faster and with less effort compared to other fish.

Denticles on shark skin are like tiny bumps or ridges. They disrupt the flow of water around
the shark's body, making it smoother and reducing turbulence. This disruption reduces the

resistance the shark experiences as it swim, allowing it to move faster and with less effort.
Turbulence in Water

Turbulence is when a fluid, like water or air, becomes chaotic and unpredictable. Insteadof
flowing smoothly, it swirls and forms irregular patterns. This turbulence creates resistance or
drag, which makes it harder for things to move through the fluid. In swimming, reducing
turbulence is important because it helps to minimize resistance, allowing swimmers to move

more easily and efficiently through the water.

Reducing Drag

When a shark swims through the water, the water normally flows smoothly over its body.
However, the denticles on the shark's skin disrupt this smooth flow. They create small
disturbances in the water, which helps to break up turbulent currents that can slow the shark
down. By reducing turbulence, the denticles make the flow of water around the shark's body
smoother. This smoother flow reduces the resistance or drags the shark experiences as it

moves through the water, allowing it to swim more efficiently.
Frictionless Swim Suits

Shark skin has inspired the development of friction-reducing swim suits, which are designed
