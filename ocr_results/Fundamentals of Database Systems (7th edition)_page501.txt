14.2 Functional Dependencies

This informal guideline obviously needs to be stated more formally. In Section 15.2
we discuss a formal condition called the nonadditive (or lossless) join property that
guarantees that certain joins do not produce spurious tuples.

14.1.5 Summary and Discussion of Design Guidelines

In Sections 14.1.1 through 14.1.4, we informally discussed situations that lead to
problematic relation schemas and we proposed informal guidelines for a good rela-
tional design. The problems we pointed out, which can be detected without addi-
tional tools of analysis, are as follows:

= Anomalies that cause redundant work to be done during insertion into and
modification of a relation, and that may cause accidental loss of information
during a deletion from a relation

= Waste of storage space due to NULLs and the difficulty of performing selec-
tions, aggregation operations, and joins due to NULL values

= Generation of invalid and spurious data during joins on base relations with
matched attributes that may not represent a proper (foreign key, primary
key) relationship

In the rest of this chapter we present formal concepts and theory that may be used
to define the goodness and badness of individual relation schemas more precisely.
First we discuss functional dependency as a tool for analysis. Then we specify the
three normal forms and Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) for relation schemas as
the established and accepted standards of quality in relational design. The strategy
for achieving a good design is to decompose a badly designed relation appropriately
to achieve higher normal forms. We also briefly introduce additional normal forms
that deal with additional dependencies. In Chapter 15, we discuss the properties of
decomposition in detail and provide a variety of algorithms related to functional
dependencies, goodness of decomposition, and the bottom-up design of relations
by using the functional dependencies as a starting point.

14.2 Functional Dependencies

So far we have dealt with the informal measures of database design. We now intro-
duce a formal tool for analysis of relational schemas that enables us to detect and
describe some of the above-mentioned problems in precise terms. The single most
important concept in relational schema design theory is that of a functional depen-
dency. In this section we formally define the concept, and in Section 14.3 we see
how it can be used to define normal forms for relation schemas.

14.2.1 Definition of Functional Dependency

A functional dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes from the
database. Suppose that our relational database schema has n attributes Aj, A,
.., A,; let us think of the whole database as being described by a single universal
