1) Address Decoder:

o Its function is to decode the address, in-order to recognize the input device
whose address isavailable on the unidirectional address bus.

o The recognition of input device is done first, and then the control and data
registers becomes active.

o The unidirectional address bus of system bus is connected to input of the
address decoder asshown in figure

2) Control Circuit:
o The control bus of system bus is connected to control circuit as shown in the
fig.
o The processor sends commands to the I/O system through the control bus.
o It controls the read write operations with respect to I/O device.

3) Status & Data register:

o It specifies type of operation (either read or write operation) to be performed
on I/O device. Itspecifies the position of operation.

4) Data Register:

o The data bus carries the data from the I/O devices to or from the processor.
The data bus isconnected to the data/ status register.
o The data register stores the data, read from input device or the data, to be
written into outputdevice. There are 2 types:
DATAIN - Input-buffer associated with keyboard.
DATAOUT -Output data buffer of a display/printer.

Data buffering is an essential task of an I/O interface. Data transfer rates of
processor and memory are high, when compared with the I/O devices, hence the
data are buffered at the I/O interface circuit and then forwarded to output device,
or forwarded to processor in case of input devices.
