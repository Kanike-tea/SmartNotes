accounts for the front-end modules (clients) communicating with a number of
back-end databases (servers).

Advances in encryption and decryption technology make it safer to transfer sensi-
tive data from server to client in encrypted form, where it will be decrypted. The
latter can be done by the hardware or by advanced software. This technology gives
higher levels of data security, but the network security issues remain a major con-
cern. Various technologies for data compression also help to transfer large amounts
of data from servers to clients over wired and wireless networks.

2.6 Classification of Database
Management Systems

Several criteria can be used to classify DBMSs. The first is the data model on
which the DBMS is based. The main data model used in many current commercial
DBMSs is the relational data model, and the systems based on this model are
known as SQL systems. The object data model has been implemented in some
commercial systems but has not had widespread use. Recently, so-called big data
systems, also known as key-value storage systems and NOSQL systems, use vari-
ous data models: document-based, graph-based, column-based, and key-value
data models. Many legacy applications still run on database systems based on the
hierarchical and network data models.

The relational DBMSs are evolving continuously, and, in particular, have been
incorporating many of the concepts that were developed in object databases. This
has led to a new class of DBMSs called object-relational DBMSs. We can catego-
rize DBMSs based on the data model: relational, object, object-relational, NOSQL,
key-value, hierarchical, network, and other.

Some experimental DBMSs are based on the XML (eXtended Markup Language)
model, which is a tree-structured data model. These have been called native XML
DBMSs. Several commercial relational DBMSs have added XML interfaces and
storage to their products.

The second criterion used to classify DBMSs is the number of users supported by
the system. Single-user systems support only one user at a time and are mostly
used with PCs. Multiuser systems, which include the majority of DBMSs, support
concurrent multiple users.

The third criterion is the number of sites over which the database is distributed. A
DBMS is centralized if the data is stored at a single computer site. A centralized
DBMS can support multiple users, but the DBMS and the database reside totally at
a single computer site. A distributed DBMS (DDBMS) can have the actual database
and DBMS software distributed over many sites connected by a computer network.
Big data systems are often massively distributed, with hundreds of sites. The data is
often replicated on multiple sites so that failure of a site will not make some data
unavailable.
