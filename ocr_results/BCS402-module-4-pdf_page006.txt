MICROCONTROLLER(BCS402)

The second type is a specific instruction that causes an exception—the

SWI instruction.

Both types suspend the normal flow of a program.

4.2.1 Assigning Interrupts

A system designer can decide which hardware peripheral can produce

which interrupt request. This decision can be implemented in hardware or

software (or both) and depends upon the embedded system being used.

An interrupt controller unit is used to connects multiple external

interrupts to one of the two ARM interrupt requests either IRQ or FIQ.

The system designers will use a standard design practice to assigning

interrupts.

@ Software Interrupts are normally reserved to call privileged operating
system routines. For example, an SWI instruction can be used to
change a program running in user mode to a privileged mode.

@ IRQ Requests are normally assigned for general-purpose interrupts.
The IRQ exception has a lower priority and higher interrupt latency
than the FIQ exception.

@ Fast Interrupt Requests are normally reserved for a single interrupt
source that requires a fast response time.

@ In an embedded operating system design, the FIQ exception is used
for a specific application and the IRQ exception are used for more
general operating system activities.

4.2.2 Interrupt Latency
It is the time interval, from an external interrupt request signal being

raised to the first fetch of an instruction of a specific interrupt service
routine (ISR).
Interrupt latency depends on a combination of hardware and software.
System designer must balance the system design to handle multiple
simultaneous interrupt sources and minimize interrupt latency.
If the interrupts are not handled in a timely manner, then the system will
exhibit slow response times.
Software handlers have two main methods to minimize interrupt latency.
1) Nested interrupt handler,
2) Prioritization.
Nested interrupt handler
Nested interrupt handler allows other interrupts to occur even when it is
currently servicing an existing interrupt.
This is achieved by reenabling the interrupts as soon as the interrupt
source has been serviced but before the interrupt handling is complete.
Once a nested interrupt has been serviced, then control is relinquished to
the original interrupt service routine. Fig 4.3 shows the three level nested
interrupt,
