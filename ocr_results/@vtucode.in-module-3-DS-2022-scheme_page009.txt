DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

8. Degree of a node
In a tree data structure, the total number of children of a node is called as DEGREE of that

Node. In simple words, the Degree of a node is total number of children it has. The highest
degree of a node among all the nodes in a tree is called as 'Degree of Tree' Ex: Degree of B is
3, Ais 2 and of FisO

9. Level of a node

In a tree data structure, the root node is said to be at Level 0 and the children of root node are
at Level 1 and the children of the nodes which are at Level | will be at Level 2 and so on... In
simple words, in a tree each step from top to bottom is called as a Level and the Level count

starts with '0' and incremented by one at each level (Step).

10. Height
In a tree data structure, the total number of egdes from leaf node to a particular node in the

longest path is called as HEIGHT of that Node. In a tree, height of the root node is said to be

height of the tree. In a tree, height of all leaf nodes is '0'.

(A) Height is 3

- Inany tree, ‘Height of Node’ is
total number of Edges from leaf
to that node in longest path.

- Inany tree, ‘Height of Tree’ is
the height of the root node.

11. Depth
In a tree data structure, the total number of egdes from root node to a particular node is called

as DEPTH of that Node. In a tree, the total number of edges from root node to a leaf node in
the longest path is said to be Depth of the tree. In simple words, the highest depth of any leaf

node in a tree is said to be depth of that tree. In a tree, depth of the root node is '0'.
