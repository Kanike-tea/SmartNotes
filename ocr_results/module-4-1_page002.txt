Data Structures and Applications (15CS33)

List Representation:

The tree can be represented as a List. The tree of figure (A) could be written as the list.
(A B (E ({K, L), F),C (G),D (H (M), 1, J) ))

e The information in the root node comes first.
e The root node is followed by a list of the subtrees of that node.

Tree node is represented by a memory node that has fields for the data and pointers to the tree
node's children

Figure (B): List representation of the tree of figure (A)

Since the degree of each tree node may be different,so memory nodes with a varying number

of pointer fields are used.
For a tree of degree k, the node structure can be represented as below figure. Each child field
is used to point to a subtree.

DATA | CHILD1 | CHILD2 | ~ | CHILDE

Left Child-Right Sibling Representation

The below figure show the node structure used in the left child-right sibling representation

data

left child right sibling

Figure (c): Left child right sibling node structure

To convert the tree of Figure (A) into this representation:
1. First note that every node has at most one leftmost child
2. At most one closest right sibling.
