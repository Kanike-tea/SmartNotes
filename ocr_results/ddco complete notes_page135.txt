Idea of Pipelining in a computer

a pipelined processor may process each instruction in four steps, as follows:

(a) Instruction execution divided into four steps

D : Decode
F: Fetch instruction E: Execute W : Write

instruction and fetch operation results
operands

(b) Hardware organization
The sequence of events for this case is shown in Figure a. Four instructions are in
progress at any given time. This means that four distinct hardware units are
needed, as shown in Figure b. These units must be capable of performing their
tasks simultaneously and without interfering with one another. Information is
passed from one unit to the next through a storage buffer. As an instruction
progresses through the pipeline, all the information needed by the stages
