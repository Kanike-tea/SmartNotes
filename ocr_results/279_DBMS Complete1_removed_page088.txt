Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

When attributes in a relation have multi-valued dependency, further Normalization to 4NF and SNF
are required. Let us first find out what multi-valued dependency is.

A multi-valued dependency is a typical kind of dependency in which each and every attribute
within a relation depends upon the other, yet none of them is a unique primary key.

We will illustrate this with an example. Consider a vendor supplying many items to many projects
in an organization. The following are the assumptions:

1. A vendor is capable of supplying many items.
2. Aproject uses many items.

3. A vendor supplies to many projects.

4. An item may be supplied by many vendors.

A multi valued dependency exists here because all the attributes depend upon the other and yet none
of them is a primary key having unique value.
