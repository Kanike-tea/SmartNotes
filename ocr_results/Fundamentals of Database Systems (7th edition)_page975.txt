25.6 General Discussion

the open source version of Hadoop/MR (see, for example, Pavlo et al. (2009)).
These experts measure the performance of these two approaches on the same
benchmark using a 100-node cluster. They admit that the parallel database took
longer to load and tune compared to MR, but the performance of parallel DBMSs
was “strikingly better.” We list the areas the experts compared in the study and
attempt to show the progress made in both DBMSs and Hadoop since then.

Performance. In their paper, Pavlo et al. concluded that parallel DBMSs were
three to six times faster than MR. The paper lists many reasons why the DBMSs
gave better performance. Among the reasons given are the following: (i) indexing
with B*-trees, which expedites selection and filtering; (ii) novel storage orientation
(e.g., column-based storage has certain advantages); (iii) techniques that allow
operations on compressed data directly; and (iv) parallel query optimization tech-
niques common in parallel DBMSs.

Since the time of Pavlo et al.’s comparison, which involved Hadoop version 0.19,
huge strides have been made in the MR runtime, the storage formats, and the plan-
ning capabilities for job scheduling and for optimizing complex data flows in the
Hadoop ecosystem. ORC and Parquet file formats are sophisticated Columnar file
formats that have the same aggressive compression techniques, the ability to push
predicates to the storage layer, and the ability to answer aggregate queries without
scanning data. We will briefly talk about the improvements in HDFS and MR;
Apache Hive has made huge strides in both the runtime and Cost-based optimiza-
tions of complex SQLs. In their move to transform Hadoop from batch into real-
time and interactive query mode, Hortonworks (2014) reports orders-of-magnitude
gains in performance of queries on a TPC-DS (decision support )-style bench-
mark. Cloudera’s Impala product, as reported in Cloudera (2014), uses Parquet
(the open source columnar data format) and is claimed to perform comparably to
traditional RDBMSs.

Upfront Cost advantage. Hadoop has maintained its cost advantage. With few
exceptions, Hadoop continues to be primarily an open source platform. YARN,
Hive, and Spark are all developed as Apache projects and are available as freely
downloadable packages.

Handling Unstructured/Semistructured data. MR reads data by applying the
schema definition to it; doing so allows it to handle semistructured datasets like
CSVS, JSON, and XML documents. The loading process is relatively inexpensive
for the Hadoop/MR systems. However, the support for unstructured data is defi-
nitely on the rise in RDBMSs. PostgreSQL now supports key-value stores and json;
most RDBMSs have a support for XML. On the other hand, one of the reasons for
the performance gains on the Hadoop side has been the use of specialized data for-
mats like ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) and Parquet (another open source
columnar format). The latter may not remain a strongly differentiating feature
among RDBMSs and Hadoop-based systems for too long because RDBMSs may
also incorporate special data formats.
