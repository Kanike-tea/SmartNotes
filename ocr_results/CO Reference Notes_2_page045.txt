Bandwidth
¢ It is defined as the number of bits or bytes that can be transferred in one second.
¢ Bandwidth mainly depends on
1) The speed of access to the stored data &
2) The number of bits that can be accessed in parallel.

DOUBLE DATA RATE SDRAM (DDR-SDRAM)
© The standard SDRAM performs all actions on the rising edge of the clock signal.
* The DDR-SDRAM transfer data on both the edges (loading edge, trailing edge).
* The Bandwidth of DDR-SDRAM is doubled for long burst transfer.
* To make it possible to access the data at high rate, the cell array is organized into two banks.
« Each bank can be accessed separately.
* Consecutive words of a given block are stored in different banks.
¢ Such interleaving of words allows simultaneous access to two words.
© The two words are transferred on successive edge of the clock.

STRUCTURE OF LARGER MEMORIES
Dynamic Memory System
© The physical implementation is done in the form of memory-modules.
© Ifa large memory is built by placing DRAM chips directly on the Motherboard,
then it will occupy large amount of space on the board.
These packaging consideration have led to the development of larger memory units known as SIMM"“s &
DIMM*“s.
1) SIMM 3 Single Inlinememory-module
2) DIMM > Dual Inline memory-module
¢ SIMM/DIMM consists of many memory-chips on small board that plugs into a socket on motherboard.

MEMORY-SYSTEM CONSIDERATION- MEMORY CONTROLLER
© To reduce the number of pins, the dynamic memory-chips use multiplexed-address inputs.
© The address is divided into 2 parts:

1) High Order Address Bit

> Select a row in cell array.

> It is provided first and latched into memory-chips under the control of RAS“ signal.
2) Low Order Address Bit

> Selects a column.

> They are provided on same address pins and latched using CAS“ signals.
