3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys

= The company is organized into departments. Each department has a unique
name, a unique number, and a particular employee who manages the depart-
ment. We keep track of the start date when that employee began managing
the department. A department may have several locations.

= A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique
name, a unique number, and a single location.

= The database will store each employee’s name, Social Security number,”
address, salary, sex (gender), and birth date. An employee is assigned to one
department, but may work on several projects, which are not necessarily
controlled by the same department. It is required to keep track of the cur-
rent number of hours per week that an employee works on each project, as
well as the direct supervisor of each employee (who is another employee).

= The database will keep track of the dependents of each employee for insur-
ance purposes, including each dependent’s first name, sex, birth date, and
relationship to the employee.

Figure 3.2 shows how the schema for this database application can be displayed by
means of the graphical notation known as ER diagrams. This figure will be
explained gradually as the ER model concepts are presented. We describe the step-
by-step process of deriving this schema from the stated requirements—and explain
the ER diagrammatic notation—as we introduce the ER model concepts.

3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes,
and Keys

The ER model describes data as entities, relationships, and attributes. In Section 3.3.1
we introduce the concepts of entities and their attributes. We discuss entity types
and key attributes in Section 3.3.2. Then, in Section 3.3.3, we specify the initial con-
ceptual design of the entity types for the COMPANY database. We describe relation-
ships in Section 3.4.

3.3.1 Entities and Attributes

Entities and Their Attributes. The basic concept that the ER model represents is
an entity, which is a thing or object in the real world with an independent existence.
An entity may be an object with a physical existence (for example, a particular per-
son, car, house, or employee) or it may be an object with a conceptual existence (for
instance, a company, a job, or a university course). Each entity has attributes—the
particular properties that describe it. For example, an EMPLOYEE entity may be
described by the employee’s name, age, address, salary, and job. A particular entity

?The Social Security number, or SSN, is a unique nine-digit identifier assigned to each individual in the
United States to keep track of his or her employment, benefits, and taxes. Other countries may have
similar identification schemes, such as personal identification card numbers.
