Platonic Solids

Solid bodies having faces and vertices which are such that (i) all faces are Congruent,
(ii) the same number of faces meet at each vertex, are called platonic solids, t

For example, consider a cubic solid. Such a solid contains six faces and eight vertices, , i
the faces are squares of equal area and are therefore congruent, and exactly three faces Meet y
each vertex. Therefore, a cubic solid (or simply a cube) is a platonic solid. '

The regular tetrahedron (four faces and four vertices) is another example of a Plantonic
solid. In this solid body, the faces are congruent triangles and exactly three faces meet at every
vertex.

Itis not hard to realize that the cube and the regular tetrahedron can be represented by |
planar graphs. Figure 2.9(a) depicts a cube and Figure 2.9(b) depicts its representation as

a planar graph. Figure 2.10(a) depicts a regular tetrahedron and Figure 2.10(b) depicts its
representation as a planar graph.
