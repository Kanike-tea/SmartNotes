DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

Self-Referential Structures

+ A self-referential structure is one in which one or more of its components is a pointer to
itself.

+ These require dynamic storage management routines (malloc & free) to explicitly obtain

and release memory.

typedef struct list

{

char data;

list *link; //list is a pointer to a list structure

¢ Consider three structures and values assigned to their respective fields:

List iteml,item2,item3;
iteml.data='a';

item2.data='b';

item3.data='c';
item1.link=item2.link=item3.1link=NULL;

e We can attach these structures together as follows

item1.link=é&item2;
item2.link=é&item3;
