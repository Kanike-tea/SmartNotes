29.4 Building a Data Warehouse

Data warehouses must also be designed with full consideration of the environment
in which they will reside. Important design considerations include the following:
Usage projections

The fit of the data model

Characteristics of available sources

Design of the meta-data component

Modular component design

Design for manageability and change

Considerations of distributed and parallel architecture

We discuss each of these in turn. Warehouse design is initially driven by usage pro-
jections; that is, by expectations about who will use the warehouse and how they
will use it. Choice of a data model to support this usage is a key initial decision.
Usage projections and the characteristics of the warehouse’s data sources are both
taken into account. Modular design is a practical necessity to allow the warehouse
to evolve with the organization and its information environment. Additionally, a
well-built data warehouse must be designed for maintainability, enabling the ware-
house managers to plan for and manage change effectively while providing optimal
support to users.

You may recall the term meta-data from Chapter 1; meta-data was defined as the
description of a database; this description includes the database’s schema defini-
tion. The meta-data repository is a key data warehouse component. The meta-data
repository includes both technical and business meta-data. The first, technical
meta-data, covers details of acquisition, processing, storage structures, data
descriptions, warehouse operations and maintenance, and access support function-
ality. The second, business meta-data, includes the relevant business rules and
organizational details supporting the warehouse.

The architecture of the organization’s distributed computing environment is a
major determining characteristic for the design of the warehouse. There are two
basic distributed architectures: the distributed warehouse and the federated ware-
house. For a distributed warehouse, all the issues of distributed databases are rele-
vant; for example, replication, partitioning, communications, and consistency
concerns. A distributed architecture can provide benefits particularly important to
warehouse performance, such as improved load balancing, scalability of perfor-
mance, and higher availability. A single replicated meta-data repository would
reside at each distribution site. The idea of the federated warehouse is like that of
the federated database: a decentralized confederation of autonomous data ware-
houses, each with its own meta-data repository. Given the magnitude of the chal-
lenge inherent to data warehouses, it is likely that such federations will consist of
smaller scale components, such as data marts.

Businesses are becoming dissatisfied with the traditional data warehousing tech-
niques and technologies. New analytic requirements are driving new analytic appli-
ances; examples include Netezza of IBM, Greenplum of EMC, Hana of SAP, and
