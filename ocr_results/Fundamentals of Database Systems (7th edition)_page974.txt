Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop

distributed, open source, nonrelational database that manages tables with billions of
rows and millions of columns. HBase is patterned after BigTable from Google” but is
implemented using Hadoop and HDFS. Hoya is being developed to address the need
for creating on-demand clusters of HBase, with possibly different versions of HBase
running on the same cluster. Each of the HBase instances can be individually config-
ured. The Hoya ApplicationMaster launches the HBase Master locally. The Hoya AM
also asks the YARN RM for a set of containers to launch HBase RegionServers on the
cluster. HBase RegionServers are the worker processes of Hbase; each ColumnFamily
(which is like a set of Columns in a relational table) is distributed across a set of
RegionServers. This can be used to start one or more HBase instances on the cluster,
on demand. The clusters are elastic and can grow or shrink based on demand.

The above three examples of the applications developed on YARN should give
the reader a sense of the possibilities that have been opened up by the decoupling
of Resource Management from Application Management in the overall
Hadoop/MapReduce architecture by YARN.

25.6 General Discussion

So far, we have discussed the big data technology development that has occurred
roughly in the 2004-2014 time frame, and we have emphasized Hadoop v1 and
YARN (also referred to as Hadoop v2 or MRy2). In this section, we must first state
the following disclaimer: there are a number of ongoing projects under Apache open
source banner as well as in companies devoted to developing products in this area
(e.g., Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR) as well as many private startup companies.
Similarly, the Amplab at University of California and other academic institutions are
contributing heavily to developing technology that we have not been able to cover in
detail. There is also a series of issues associated with the cloud concept, with running
MapReduce in the cloud environment, and with data warehousing in the cloud that
we have not discussed. Given this background, we now cover a few general topics
that are worth mentioning in the context of the elaborate descriptions we presented
so far in this chapter. We present issues related to the tussle between the traditional
approach to high performance applications in parallel RDBMS implementations vis-
a-vis Hadoop- and YARN-based technologies. Then we present a few points related
to how big data and cloud technologies will be complementary in nature. We outline
issues related to the locality of data and the optimization issues inherent in the stor-
age clouds and the compute clouds. We also discuss YARN as a data services plat-
form and the ongoing movement to harness big data for analytics. Finally, we present
some current challenges facing the entire big data movement.

25.6.1 Hadoop/MapReduce vs. Parallel RDBMS

A team of data experts, including Abadi, DeWitt, Madden, and Stonebracker, have
done a methodological study comparing a couple of parallel database systems with

2°BigTable is described in Chang et al. (2006).
