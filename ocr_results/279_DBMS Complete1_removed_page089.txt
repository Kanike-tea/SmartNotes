V3 Il P2
V3 Il P3

The given relation has a number of problems. For example:

1. If vendor V1 has to supply to project P2, but the item is not yet decided, then a row with a
blank for item code has to be introduced.
2. The information about item I1 is stored twice for vendor V3.

Observe that the relation given is in 3NF and also in BCNF. It still has the problem mentioned
above. The problem is reduced by expressing this relation as two relations in the Fourth Normal
Form (4NF). A relation is in 4NF if it has no more than one independent multi valued dependency
or one independent multi valued dependency with a functional dependency.

The table can be expressed as the two 4NF relations given as following. The fact that vendors are
capable of supplying certain items and that they are assigned to supply for some projects in
independently specified in the 4NF relation.

Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

These relations still have a problem. While defining the 4NF we mentioned that all the attributes
depend upon each other. While creating the two tables in the 4NF, although we have preserved the
dependencies between Vendor Code and Item code in the first table and Vendor Code and Item code
in the second table, we have lost the relationship between Item Code and Project No. If there were a
primary key then this loss of dependency would not have occurred. In order to revive this
relationship we must add a new table like the following. Please note that during the entire process
of normalization, this is the only step where a new table is created by joining two attributes, rather
than splitting them into separate tables.
