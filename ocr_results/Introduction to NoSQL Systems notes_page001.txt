e Availability (A)
«Partition Tolerance (P)

This theorem helps database architects and system designers understand the trade-offs they
must make when building and scaling distributed systems, especially in the context of NoSQL
databases.

2. Definitions of CAP Properties

1. Consistency (C)
Every read receives the most recent write or an error. This means that all nodes ina
distributed system return the same data at any given time. It’s similar to the ACID
concept of consistency in relational databases.

2. Availability (A)
Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guarantee that it contains the
most recent write. In other words, the system is operational and responsive at all
times, even if some data is outdated or inconsistent.

3. Partition Tolerance (P)
The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication
breakdowns) between nodes. In real-world distributed systems, network failures are
inevitable, so partition tolerance is a must.

3. The Theorem in Practice

According to the CAP theorem, a distributed system can only satisfy two of the three
guarantees at any given time, especially during a network failure. This leads to three
possible combinations:

1. CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)

o The system remains consistent and tolerates partitions but may become
unavailable during a failure.

o Example: HBase, MongoDB (default configuration)
o Use Case: Banking systems where consistency is critical.
2. AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)

o The system remains available and tolerates partitions but may return stale or
inconsistent data.

o Example: Cassandra, DynamoDB, Couchbase
