4 Find the minimum number of vertices necessary for a connected simple graph with 7 edges to be
planar. (Ans: 5)

5, Show that a connected simple planar graph with less than 30 edges must have a vertex of degree
<4

6. If G is a connected simple planar graph which has no cycles of length 3, show that G contains a
vertex of degree at most 3.

7. Prove that, if G is a connected simple planar (n,m) graph in which every region is bounded by.a
cycle with k vertices, then m = k(n — 2)/(k - 2).

8. For each of the planar graphs shown in Figure 2.24, verify that the sum of the degrees of the
regions is equal to twice the number of edges.

9. Let G be a connected simple planar graph. Prove the following:

(1) If the degree of G is at least 5, then G has at least 12 vertices of degree 5.

(2) If the degree of G is at least 3 and the order of G is at least 4, then G has at least 4 vertices
of degree less than 6.

10. Prove that every connected simple planar graph with n > 4 vertices has at least four vertices of
degree five or less.

2.3 Detection of planarity

Given a graph G, the determination of its planarity or otherwise is an important problem. This
Problem can be tackled by employing what is known as Elementary Reduction. The steps
involved in this reduction are as explained below:

Elementary Reduction
Step 1. Given a graph G, determine the set

A = {G1,G2,---+Gk}

where G\,G2,...G, are subgraphs of.G every pair of which has exactly one vertex in
common (~ such subgraphs are called blocks).
