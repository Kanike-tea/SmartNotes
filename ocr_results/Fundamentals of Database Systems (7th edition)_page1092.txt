Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

Definition Questions: This type of question asks about the definition and
meaning of the concept, and to extract the essential information and properties
of the concept. Examples include “What is an inert gas ?”, “Who is Alexander
the Great?”, and “What is the LIBOR rate?”.

Opinion Questions: This type of question seeks different views on a subject
that the question. For example, “What countries should be allowed to test
nuclear weapons?” and “What is the sentiment in Saudi Arabia about terrorism
in the Middle East?”

In recent years, joint initiatives in research and academia have advocated adopting
common metrics, architectures, tools, and methodologies to create baselines that
will facilitate and improve the QA technique.

Architectures. Most state-of-the-art QA architectures are generally made up of
pipelines that comprise the following stages:

Question Analysis: This stage involves analyzing questions and converting
them to structural representations of analyzed text for processing by down-
stream components. Answer types are extracted from parsed representations of
questions using some or all of the following techniques: shallow semantic pars-
ing, focus detection, answer type classification, named entity recognition, and
co-reference resolution.

Shallow semantic parsing: The process of assigning surface-level markups to
sentence structures via supervised machine learning methods. In general,
frames are automatically instantiated for sentences by trying to match “WHO
did WHAT to WHOM, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, and HOW” elements.

© Focus detection: In an image, certain things stand out whereas others
remain in the background. We say that things that stand out are in focus.
Similarly, in QA, questions have focus words that contain references to
answers. For example, in the question “Which book of Shakespeare is a
tragedy about lovers?”, the focus words “book of Shakespeare” can be
instantiated with the rule “which X’, where X is a noun phrase in a sen-
tence. QA systems use focus words to trigger directed searches and to aid
in answer resolution.

© Answer type classification: This phase helps determine the categories of
answers in QA. In the preceding example, the headword of the focus words,
“book’, is the answer type for this question. Several machine learning tech-
niques are applied in QA to determine the answer type of a question.

o Named entity recognition: Named entity recognition seeks to classify ele-
ments in text into predefined categories, such as person, place, animal,
country, river, continent.

| Co-reference resolution: The task of co-reference resolution is about
identifying multiple expressions in text that refer to the same thing. For
example, in the sentence “John said that he wanted to go to the theater on
Sunday’, the pronoun “he” refers to “John” and is a co-reference in text.
