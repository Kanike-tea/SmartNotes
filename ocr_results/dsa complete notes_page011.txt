Data Structures and App! 's/BCS304 Module-1

Example : When the compiler encounters an array declaration such as int A[3][4] it creates an array
A and allocates 20 consecutive memory locations. Each memory location is large enough to hold a
single integer.

Let a be the address of the first element A[0][0], is called the base address

Considering Row major order: Using the bases address we can calculate the addresses of other
element

Address of A[O][1] = 100 +2[0*4+ 1]= 100 +2=102

Address of A[0][2] = 100 +2[0*4+ 2]= 100 +4=104

Address of A[1][0] = 100 +2[1*4+ 0]= 100 +8=108

Addres of A[2][3]= 100 +2[2*4+3]= 100+22= 122

Representation of Multidimensional Arrays: In C, multidimensional arrays are represented using
the array-of-arrays representation The linear list is then stored in consecutive memory just as we store
a one-dimensional array.

If an n-dimensional array a is declared as a[upperO][upperl] --- [wppern-1]; then the number of
elements in the array is: uppero*upperi*...... uppefn-1 also represented as

Thepper;

i=
where I] is the product of the upperi's. For instance, if we declare a as a[10][10][10], then we require
10-10-10 = 1000 memory cell to hold the array. There are two common ways to represent
multidimensional arrays: row major order and column major order. We consider only row major order
here. As its name implies, row major order stores multidimensional arrays by rows.

Two dimensional arrays

e For instance, we interpret the two dimensional Array A[upper0][upper1] as upper0 rows, , each
row containing upper! elements.
If we assume that a the base address is the address of A[0][0]
Then the address of an arbitrary element,

Address( a[i][j])= o + i: upperl + j----------- qd)

e Here the size is not considered. Considering the size the formula can be written as

Address (a[i][j]) = & + w(i- upper! + j) where w is the size of each unit of memory location.

Representation of a three-dimensional array
e A[upper0][upper1][upper2], we interpret the array as upperO two dimensional arrays of
dimension upper! x upper2.

address of A[i][j][k]=Ua + i-upperl-upper2 + j-upper2 + k --------- (2)

Representation of a fourth-dimensional array
e A[upper0][upper! ][upper2][upper3]
e We interpret the array as upper0 three dimensional arrays of dimension upper! x upper2 x
upper3 .
address of A [i][j][k][]=Lo + i-upperl-upper2.upper3 + j-upper2..upper3 + k.upper3 +1

Representation of an n-dimensional array
e Generalizing on the preceding discussion, we can obtain the addressing formula for any
element A[iO][il] ... [in-1] in an n dimensional array declared as:
A[upper0][upper1] ... [uppern-1]
