ITEM(ltem#, Unit_price)

SHIPMENT(Order#, Warehouse#, Ship_date)

WAREHOUSE (Warehouse#, City)
Here, Ord_amt refers to total dollar amount of an order; Odate is the date the
order was placed; and Ship_date is the date an order (or part of an order) is
shipped from the warehouse. Assume that an order can be shipped from several

warehouses. Specify the foreign keys for this schema, stating any assumptions
you make. What other constraints can you think of for this database?

Consider the following relations for a database that keeps track of business
trips of salespersons in a sales office:
SALESPERSON(Ssn, Name, Start_year, Dept_no)
TRIP(Ssn, From_city, To_city, Departure_date, Return_date, Trip_id)
EXPENSE(Trip_id, Account#, Amount)

A trip can be charged to one or more accounts. Specify the foreign keys for
this schema, stating any assumptions you make.

Consider the following relations for a database that keeps track of student
enrollment in courses and the books adopted for each course:
STUDENT(Ssn, Name, Major, Bdate)
COURSE (Course#, Cname, Dept)
ENROLL(Ssn, Course#, Quarter, Grade)
BOOK_ADOPTION(Course#, Quarter, Book_isbn)
TEXT(Book isbn, Book_title, Publisher, Author)

Specify the foreign keys for this schema, stating any assumptions you make.

Consider the following relations for a database that keeps track of automo-
bile sales in a car dealership (OPTION refers to some optional equipment
installed on an automobile):

CAR(Serial_no, Model, Manufacturer, Price)
OPTION(Serial_no, Option name, Price)
SALE(Salesperson id, Serial_no, Date, Sale_price)
SALESPERSON Salesperson_id, Name, Phone)

First, specify the foreign keys for this schema, stating any assumptions you
make. Next, populate the relations with a few sample tuples, and then give
an example of an insertion in the SALE and SALESPERSON relations that
violates the referential integrity constraints and of another insertion that
does not.

Database design often involves decisions about the storage of attributes. For
example, a Social Security number can be stored as one attribute or split into
three attributes (one for each of the three hyphen-delineated groups of
