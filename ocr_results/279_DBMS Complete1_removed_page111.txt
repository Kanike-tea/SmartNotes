Data Mining:
Generally, data mining (sometimes called data or knowledge discovery) is the process of
analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information -
information that can be used to increase revenue, cuts costs, or both. Data mining software is
one of a number of analytical tools for analyzing data. It allows users to analyze data from
many different dimensions or angles, categorize it, and summarize the relationships identified.
Technically, data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of
fields in large relational databases.

While large-scale information technology has been evolving separate transaction and
analytical systems, data mining provides the link between the two. Data mining software
analyzes relationships and patterns in stored transaction data based on open-ended user
queries. Several types of analytical software are available: statistical, machine learning, and
neural networks. Generally, any of four types of relationships are sought:
¢ Classes: Stored data is used to locate data in predetermined groups. For example, a
restaurant chain could mine customer purchase data to determine when customers visit and
what they typically order. This information could be used to increase traffic by having daily
specials.
e Clusters: Data items are grouped according to logical relationships or consumer
preferences. For example, data can be mined to identify market segments or consumer
affinities.

e Associations: Data can be mined to identify associations. The beer-diaper example is an
example of associative mining.
