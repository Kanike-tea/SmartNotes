15.5 Further Discussion of Multivalued
Dependencies and 4NF

We introduced and defined the concept of multivalued dependencies and used it to
define the fourth normal form in Section 14.6. In this section, we discuss MVDs to
make our treatment complete by stating the rules of inference with MVDs.

15.5.1 Inference Rules for Functional
and Multivalued Dependencies
As with functional dependencies (FDs), inference rules for MVDs have been

developed. It is better, though, to develop a unified framework that includes both
FDs and MVDs so that both types of constraints can be considered together. The
