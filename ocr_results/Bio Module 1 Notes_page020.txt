B. Chemical Properties

¢ Ester Formation: Lipids are formed by ester bonds between glycerol and fatty acids
(e.g., triglycerides).

¢ Hydrolysis: Lipids can be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids by hydrolysis
(e.g., digestion by lipase enzymes).

¢ Oxidation: Lipids undergo oxidation to produce ener gy (ATP) and, in some cases,
peroxidation leading to rancidity.

¢ Saponification: Fats react with alkali to form soap (glycerol + fatty acid salts).

¢ Emulsification: Lipids can form emulsions with the help of emulsifiers like bile salts.

2. Functions of Lipids

A. Energy Storage

¢ Lipids store more energy per gram than carbohydrates and proteins, providing long-

term energy storage in adipose tissue.

B. Structural Component of Cell Membranes

¢ Phospholipids and cholesterol are key components of cell membranes, maintaining

fluidity and integrity.
C. Insulation and Protection

¢ Lipids act as thermal insulators, helping regulate body temperature.

¢ Provide cushioning and protection for vital organs.
D. Hormone Production

¢ Steroid lipids (e.g., cholesterol) are precursors for hormones like estrogen,

testosterone, and cortisol.

E. Signaling Molecules

¢ Lipids serve as cell signaling molecules (e.g., prostaglandins, which regulate

inflammation and pain).
