The mean and variance of the dicate probability suet: is defined 2 as follows.

Mean (u) = 5) x; - p(x) * oc | ana (1)

Variance (V)= > (x;-n) : p(x;) ; vee (2)

Standard deviation (o) =VV ...(3).

Note : Variance can also be put in the form

1. A coin is tossed twice. A random variable X represent the number of heads turning up.
Find the discrete probability distribution for X. Also find its mean and variance.

ee Se. ty IH, HT, TH, a The association of the elements of 5 to the random
variable X are <r 1,0.

Now, P(HH) = 4, P(HT) =+, ro P(TT) =

P (X=0,ie,nohead) = P(TT) =}

P (X=1Lie,lhead) = P(HTUTH) = CHT) +P (TH) =}
P (X = 2,ie.,2 heads) = P( HH) =

The discrete probability distribution for X i is as Hollows

We observe that p(x,) > 0 and Dp (3) =]
