General Tree Representations

A general Tree Structure can be represented with the following three methods. Those
methods are as follows...

1. List Representation

2. Left Child - Right Sibling Representation

3. Degree two Representation (Binary Tree Representation) Consider the following tree...

(A)

TREE with 11 nodes and 10 edges

(8) (©) - In any tree with ‘N’ nodes there
will be maximum of ‘N-1\edges

(D) (E) (F) (G) (H) - Ina tree every individual
element is called as “NODE”

1, List Representation

There are several ways to draw a tree. One useful way is as a list. The tree in the above figure
could be written as the list (A(B(D,E(LJ),F),C(G(s),H)) — list representation (with rounded
brackets).The information in the root node comes first followed by a list of the subtrees
of that node.Now, how do we represent a tree in memory? If we wish to use linked lists, then
a node must have a varying number of fields depending upon the number of branches.

Possible node structure for a tree of degree k called k-ary tree

Each link field is used to point to a subtree. This node structure is cumbersome for the following
reasons (1) Multiple node structure for different tree nodes (2) Waste of space (3) Excessive

use of links.

The other alternate method is to have linked list of child nodes which allocates memory only
for the nodes which have children.

In this representation, we use two types of nodes, one for representing the node with data and
another for representing only references. We start with a node with data from root node in the

tree. Then it is linked to an internal node through a reference node and is linked to any other
