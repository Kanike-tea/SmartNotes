Cache Line Replacement Policy

On a cache miss, the cache controller must select a cache line from the available set in cache
memory to store the new information from main memory. The cache line selected for
replacement is known as a victim. If the victim contains valid, dirty data, the controller must
write the dirty data from the cache memory to main memory before it copies new data into the
victim cache line. The process of selecting and replacing a victim cache line is known as

eviction.

The strategy implemented in a cache controller to select the next victim is called its replacement
policy. The replacement policy selects a cache line from the available associative member set;
that is, it selects the way to use in the next cache line replacement. To summarize the overall
process, the set index selects the set of cache lines available in the ways, and the replacement
policy selects the specific cache line from the set to replace. ARM cached cores support two

replacement policies, either pseudorandom or round-robin.

Round-robin or cyclic replacement simply selects the next cache line in a set to replace. The
selection algorithm uses a sequential, incrementing victim counter that increments each time the
cache controller allocates a cache line. When the victim counter reaches a maximum value, it is

reset to a defined base value.

Pseudorandom replacement randomly selects the next cache line in a set to replace. The selection
algorithm uses a non sequential incrementing victim counter. In a pseudorandom replacement
algorithm the controller increments the victim counter by randomly selecting an increment value
and adding this value to the victim counter. When the victim counter reaches a maximum value,

it is reset to a defined base value.
