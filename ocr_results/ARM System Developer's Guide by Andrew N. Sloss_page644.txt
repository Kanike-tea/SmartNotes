A.5 GNU Assembler Quick Reference 631

These directives name a list of ARM registers or a single ARM register. For example, the
following code names r0 as arg and the ATPCS preserved registers as saved.

arg RNO
saved RLIST {r4-r11}

ROUT

The ROUT directive defines a new local label area. See Section A.4.2.

SETA, SETL, SETS

These directives set the values of arithmetic, logical, and string variables, respectively.
See Section A.4.1.

SPACE (alias %)

{<label>} SPACE <numeric_expression>
This directive reserves <numeric_expression> bytes of space. The bytes are zero initialized.

WHILE, WEND

‘These directives supply an assemble-time looping structure. WHILE is followed by a logical
expression. While this expression is true, the assembler repeats the code between WHILE
and WEND. The following example shows how to create an array of powers of two from 1 to
65,536.

GBLA count,
count SETA 1
WHILE — count<=65536

DCD count
count SETA 2*count
WEND

This section summarizes the more useful commands and expressions available with the
GNU assembler, gas, when you target this assembler for ARM. Each assembly line has the
