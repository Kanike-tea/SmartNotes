Here, For Figure (b) n=4, no= m+1= 44+1=5
Therefore, the total number of leaf node=5

BINARY TREE REPRESENTATION

The storage representation of binary trees can be classified as
1. Array representation
2. Linked representation.

Array representation:

e A tree can be represented using an array, which is called sequential representation.

e The nodes are numbered from | to n, and one dimensional array can be used to store
the nodes.

e Position 0 of this array is left empty and the node numbered i is mapped to position i of

the array.

Below figure shows the array representation for both the trees of figure (a).
