address value NUM2 when the above instruction is executed in the second pass through the loop.

ADDRESSING MODES
* The different ways in which the location of an operand is specified in an instruction are referred to as
Addressing Modes (Table 2.1).

Table 2.1 Generic addressing modes

Name Assembler syatax Addressing function
Immediate #Value Operand = Value
Register Ri EA=Ri
Absolute (Direct) Loc EA=LOC
Indirect iy EA=[Ri}

(oc EA={LOC}

+ Index x(RI) EA=(Ri]+X
Base with index (RiRj) FA= [Ri] +IRj]
Base with index X(RERJ) “EA=(Ri}+(Rj]+X

and offset

Relative X(PC) EA=[PC1+X

‘Autoincrement Ri) EA = (Rij;
Tocrement Ri

Antodecrement Ri) Decrement Ri;
EA={Ri)

EA = effective address

Value = 0 signed number

IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIABLE AND CONSTANTS
+ Variable is represented by allocating a memory-location to hold its value.
+ Thus, the value can be changed as needed using appropriate instructions.
+ There are 2 accessing modes to access the variables:
1) Register Mode
2) Absolute Mode
Register Mode
+ The operand is the contents of a register.
+ The name (or address) of the register is given in the instruction.
+ Registers are used as temporary storage locations where the data in a register are accessed.
+ For example, the instruction
Move RI, R2 sCopy content of register RI into register R2.
Absolute (Direct) Mode
+ The operand is in a memory-location.
+ The address of memory-location is given explicitly in the instruction.
+ The absolute mode can represent global variables in the program.
+ For example, the instruction
Move LOC, R2 ;Copy content of memory-location LOC into register
R2.

Immediate Mode
+ The operand is given explicitly in the instruction.
+ For example, the instruction
Move #200, RO ;Place the value 200 in register RO.
* Clearly, the immediate mode is only used to specify the value of a source-operand.

INDIRECTION AND POINTERS
+ Instruction does not give the operand or its address explicitly.
+ Instead, the instruction provides information from which the new address of the operand can be
determined.
+ This address is called Effective Address (EA) of the operand.
Indirect Mode

+ The EA of the operand is the contents of a register(or memory-location).
