Given two graphs G and Gj, we say that G; is a subgraph of G i g
hold.

(1) All the vertices and all the edges of G; are in G.

(ii) Each edge of G, has the same end vertices in G as in G,.

Essentially, a subgraph is a gray

Consider the two graphs G; a

Observe that all vertices and all edges of the graph G are j
