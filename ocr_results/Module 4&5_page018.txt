Microcontrollers - BCS402

Using separate stacks for each mode rather than processing using a single stack has one main

advantage: errant tasks can be debugged and isolated from the rest of the system.
3. Firmware

3.1 Firmware and bootloader

The firmware is the deeply embedded, low-level software that provides an interface between the
hardware and the application/operating system level software. It resides in the ROM and
executes when power is applied to the embedded hardware system. Firmware can remain active

after system initialization and supports basic system operations.

The bootloader is a small application that installs the operating system or application onto a
hardware target. The bootloader only exists up to the point that the operating system or

application is executing, and it is commonly incorporated into the firmware.

The first stage is to set up the target platform—in other words, prepare the environment to boot
an operating system since an operating system expects a particular type of environment before it
can operate. This step involves making sure that the platform is correctly initialized. Diagnostics
software provides a useful way for quickly identifying basic hardware malfunctions. Because of

the nature of this type of software, it tends to be specific to a particular piece of hardware.
