Binary Subtractor

The subtraction of unsigned binary numbers can be done most conveniently by means of complements.
Remember that the subtraction A - B can be done by taking the 2’s complement of B and adding it to A.
The 2’s complement can be obtained by taking the 1’s complement and adding 1 to the least significant
pair of bits. The 1’s complement can be implemented with inverters, and a 1 can be added to the sum
through the input carry.

The circuit for subtracting A - B consists of an adder with inverters placed between each data input B
and the corresponding input of the full adder. The input carry CO must be equal to 1 when subtraction is
performed. The operation thus performed becomes A, plus the 1’s complement of B, plus 1. This is equal
to A plus the 2’s complement of B.

Four-bit adder—subtractor (with overflow detection)

The addition and subtraction operations can be combined into one circuit with one common binary adder
by including an exclusive-OR gate with each full adder. A four-bit adder—subtractor circuit is shown in
above Fig. The mode input M controls the operation. When M = 0, the circuit is an adder, and when
M = 1, the circuit becomes a subtractor. Each exclusive-OR gate receives input M and one of the inputs
of B. When M = 0, we have B © 0 = B. The full adders receive the value of B, the input carry is 0, and
the circuit performs A plus B. When M = 1, we have B © 1| = B and CO = 1. The B inputs are all
complemented and a | is added through the input carry. The circuit performs the operation A plus the
2’s complement of B. (The exclusive-OR with output V is for detecting an overflow.)

Overflow

When two numbers with n digits each are added and the sum is a number occupying n+ | digits, we say
that an overflow occurred. This is true for binary or decimal numbers, signed or unsigned. When the
addition is performed with paper and pencil, an overflow is not a problem, since there is no limit by the
width of the page to write down the sum. Overflow is a problem in digital computers because the number
of bits that hold the number is finite and a result that contains n + | bits cannot be accommodated by an
n -bit word. For this reason, many computers detect the occurrence of an overflow, and when it occurs,
a corresponding flip-flop is set that can then be checked by the user.

The detection of an overflow after the addition of two binary numbers depends on whether the numbers
are considered to be signed or unsigned. When two unsigned numbers are added, an overflow is detected
from the end carry out of the most significant position. In the case of signed numbers, two details are
important: the leftmost bit always represents the sign, and negative numbers are in 2’s-complement form.
When two signed numbers are added, the sign bit is treated as part of the number and the end carry does
not indicate an overflow.
