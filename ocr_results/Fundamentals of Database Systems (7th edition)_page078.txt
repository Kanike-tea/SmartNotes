client/server architecture at the logical level; Figure 2.6 is a simplified diagram that
shows the physical architecture. Some machines would be client sites only (for
example, mobile devices or workstations/PCs that have only client software
installed). Other machines would be dedicated servers, and others would have both
client and server functionality.

The concept of client/server architecture assumes an underlying framework that
consists of many PCs/workstations and mobile devices as well as a smaller number
of server machines, connected via wireless networks or LANs and other types of
computer networks. A client in this framework is typically a user machine that pro-
vides user interface capabilities and local processing. When a client requires access
to additional functionality—such as database access—that does not exist at the cli-
ent, it connects to a server that provides the needed functionality. A server is a sys-
tem containing both hardware and software that can provide services to the client
machines, such as file access, printing, archiving, or database access. In general,
some machines install only client software, others only server software, and still
others may include both client and server software, as illustrated in Figure 2.6.
However, it is more common that client and server software usually run on separate
