Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

A relation schema’ R, denoted by R(Aj, Ap, --. , An), is made up of a relation name
Rand a list of attributes, A}, Az, ... , A; Each attribute A; is the name of a role
played by some domain D in the relation schema R. D is called the domain of A;
and is denoted by dom(A;). A relation schema is used to describe a relation; R is
called the name of this relation. The degree (or arity) of a relation is the number of
attributes n of its relation schema.

A relation of degree seven, which stores information about university students,
would contain seven attributes describing each student as follows:

STUDENT(Name, Ssn, Home_phone, Address, Office_phone, Age, Gpa)
Using the data type of each attribute, the definition is sometimes written as:

STUDENT(Name: string, Ssn: string, Home_phone: string, Address: string,
Office_phone: string, Age: integer, Gpa: real)

For this relation schema, STUDENT is the name of the relation, which has seven
attributes. In the preceding definition, we showed assignment of generic types such
as string or integer to the attributes. More precisely, we can specify the following
previously defined domains for some of the attributes of the STUDENT relation:
dom(Name) = Names; dom(Ssn) = Social_security_numbers; dom(HomePhone)
USA_phone_numbers?, dom(Office_phone) = USA_phone_numbers, and dom(Gpa) =
Grade_point_averages. It is also possible to refer to attributes of a relation schema by
their position within the relation; thus, the second attribute of the STUDENT rela-
tion is Ssn, whereas the fourth attribute is Address.

A relation (or relation state)‘ r of the relation schema R(Aj, Ao, A,), also denoted
by r(R), is a set of n-tuples r= {t, hy, ... , tm}. Each n-tuple f is an ordered list of n
values t =<vj, V2, ... , V»>, Where each value v;, 1 <i <n, is an element of dom (A)) or is
a special NULL value. (NULL values are discussed further below and in Section 5.1.2.)
The ith value in tuple ¢, which corresponds to the attribute Aj, is referred to as ¢[Aj] or
t.A; (or ¢{i] if we use the positional notation). The terms relation intension for the
schema R and relation extension for a relation state r(R) are also commonly used.

Figure 5.1 shows an example of a STUDENT relation, which corresponds to the
STUDENT schema just specified. Each tuple in the relation represents a particular
student entity (or object). We display the relation as a table, where each tuple is
shown as a row and each attribute corresponds to a column header indicating a role
or interpretation of the values in that column. NULL values represent attributes
whose values are unknown or do not exist for some individual STUDENT tuple.

2A relation schema is sometimes called a relation scheme.

With the large increase in phone numbers caused by the proliferation of mobile phones, most metropol-
itan areas in the United States now have multiple area codes, so seven-digit local dialing has been
discontinued in most areas. We changed this domain to Usa_phone_numbers instead of Local_phone_
numbers, which would be a more general choice. This illustrates how database requirements can change
over time.

‘This has also been called a relation instance. We will not use this term because instance is also used
to refer to a single tuple or row.
