Introduction
Cell Definition

“A cell is defined as the smallest, basic unit of life that is responsible for all of life’s

processes.”

Cells are the structural, functional, and biological units of all living beings. A cell can

replicate itself independently. Hence, they are known as the building blocks of life.

A cell is the structural and fundamental unit of life. The study of cells from its basic structure
to the functions of every cell organelle is called Cell Biology. Robert Hooke was the first

Biologist who discovered cells.

All organisms are made up of cells. They may be made up of a single cell (unicellular), or
many cells (multicellular). Mycoplasmas are the smallest known cells. Cells are the building
blocks of all living beings. They provide structure to the body and convert the nutrients taken

from the food into energy.

Cells are complex and their components perform various functions in an organism. They are
of different shapes and sizes, pretty much like bricks of the buildings. Our body is made up

of cells of different shapes and sizes.

Cells are the lowest level of organization in every life form. From organism to organism, the

count of cells may vary. Humans have more number of cells compared to that of bacteria.

Cells comprise several cell organelles that perform specialized functions to carry out life
processes. Every organelle has a specific structure. The hereditary material of the

organisms is also present in the cells.

Characteristics of Cells
