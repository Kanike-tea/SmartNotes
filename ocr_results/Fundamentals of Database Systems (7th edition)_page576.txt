Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures

Some of the newer technologies—such as solid-state drive (SSD) disks are likely to
provide viable alternatives to the use of magnetic disks. In the future, databases may
therefore reside at different levels of the memory hierarchy from those described in
Section 16.1.1. The levels may range from the highest speed main memory level
storage to the tape jukebox low speed offline storage. However, it is anticipated that
magnetic disks will continue to be the primary medium of choice for large data-
bases for years to come. Hence, it is important to study and understand the proper-
ties and characteristics of magnetic disks and the way data files can be organized on

disk in order to design effective databases with acceptable performance.

Magnetic tapes are frequently used as a storage medium for backing up databases
because storage on tape costs much less than storage on disk. With some interven-
tion by an operator—or an automatic loading device—tapes or optical removable
disks must be loaded and read before the data becomes available for processing. In

contrast, disks are online devices that can be accessed directly at any time.

The techniques used to store large amounts of structured data on disk are impor-
tant for database designers, the DBA, and implementers of a DBMS. Database
designers and the DBA must know the advantages and disadvantages of each stor-
age technique when they design, implement, and operate a database on a specific
DBMS. Usually, the DBMS has several options available for organizing the data.
The process of physical database design involves choosing the particular data
organization techniques that best suit the given application requirements from
among the options. DBMS system implementers must study data organization
techniques so that they can implement them efficiently and thus provide the DBA

and users of the DBMS with sufficient options.

Typical database applications need only a small portion of the database at a time for
processing. Whenever a certain portion of the data is needed, it must be located on
disk, copied to main memory for processing, and then rewritten to the disk if the
data is changed. The data stored on disk is organized as files of records. Each record
is a collection of data values that can be interpreted as facts about entities, their
attributes, and their relationships. Records should be stored on disk in a manner
that makes it possible to locate them efficiently when they are needed. We will dis-
cuss some of the techniques for making disk access more efficient in Section 17.2.2.

There are several primary file organizations, which determine how the file
records are physically placed on the disk, and hence how the records can be accessed.
A heap file (or unordered file) places the records on disk in no particular order by
appending new records at the end of the file, whereas a sorted file (or sequential
file) keeps the records ordered by the value of a particular field (called the sort key).
A hashed file uses a hash function applied to a particular field (called the hash key)
to determine a record’s placement on disk. Other primary file organizations, such
as B-trees, use tree structures. We discuss primary file organizations in Sec-
tions 16.6 through 16.9. A secondary organization or auxiliary access structure
allows efficient access to file records based on alternate fields than those that have
been used for the primary file organization. Most of these exist as indexes and will

be discussed in Chapter 17.
