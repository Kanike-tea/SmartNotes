15.9. Why can we not guarantee that BCNF relation schemas will be produced by
dependency-preserving decompositions of non-BCNF relation schemas?
Give a counterexample to illustrate this point.

15.10. What is the lossless (or nonadditive) join property of a decomposition? Why
is it important?

15.11. Between the properties of dependency preservation and losslessness, which
one must definitely be satisfied? Why?

15.12. Discuss the NULL value and dangling tuple problems.

15.13. Illustrate how the process of creating first normal form relations may lead to
multivalued dependencies. How should the first normalization be done
properly so that MVDs are avoided?

15.14. What types of constraints are inclusion dependencies meant to represent?

15.15. How do template dependencies differ from the other types of dependencies
we discussed?

15.16. Why is the domain-key normal form (DKNF) known as the ultimate nor-
mal form?

Exercises

15.17. Show that the relation schemas produced by Algorithm 15.4 are in 3NF.

15.18. Show that, if the matrix S resulting from Algorithm 15.3 does not have a row
that is all a symbols, projecting S on the decomposition and joining it back
will always produce at least one spurious tuple.

15.19. Show that the relation schemas produced by Algorithm 15.5 are in BCNF.

15.20. Write programs that implement Algorithms 15.4 and 15.5.

15.21. Consider the relation REFRIG(Model#, Year, Price, Manuf_plant, Color), which
is abbreviated as REFRIG(M, Y, P, MP, C), and the following set F of functional
dependencies: F = {M— MP, {M, Y} + P, MP > C}

a. Evaluate each of the following as a candidate key for REFRIG, giving rea-
sons why it can or cannot be a key: {M}, {M, Y}, {M, C}.
b. Based on the above key determination, state whether the relation REFRIG
is in 3NF and in BCNF, and provide proper reasons.
c. Consider the decomposition of REFRIG into D = {R,(M, Y, P),
R,(M, MP, C)}. Is this decomposition lossless? Show why. (You may
consult the test under Property NJB in Section 14.5.1.)
15.22. Specify all the inclusion dependencies for the relational schema in Figure 5.5.
15.23. Prove that a functional dependency satisfies the formal definition of multi-

valued dependency.
