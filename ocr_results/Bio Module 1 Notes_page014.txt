o rRNA (ribosomal RNA) helps in forming ribosomes and catalyzing protein
synthesis.

Regulation of Gene Expression (RNA & DNA) — Certain RNA molecules, such as
microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA), regulate gene expression by
promoting or inhibiting translation.
Energy Transfer (ATP, NAD, FAD) — Some nucleotides, such as ATP (adenosine
triphosphate), NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and FAD (flavin adenine
dinucleotide), function as energy carriers and coenzymes in metabolic processes.
Cellular Signaling (CAMP & cGMP) — Cyclic nucleotides like cAMP (cyclic
adenosine monophosphate) and cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) act as
secondary messengers in signal transduction pathways.
Catalysis of Reactions (Ribozymes) — Certain RNA molecules, known as ribozymes,

can catalyze biochemical reactions, such as splicing and peptide bond formation.

These functions make nucleic acids fundamental to life, influencing everything from heredity

to cellular metabolism.

1.3 Proteins:

Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of chains of smaller building blocks

called amino acids. They play a vital role in the structure, function, and regulation of cells,

tissues, and organs.

Properties of Proteins

Proteins are complex biomolecules made up of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. They
play essential roles in structure, function, and regulation within living organisms.

Physical Properties of Proteins
A. Solubility

Fibrous proteins (e.g., collagen, keratin) are insoluble in water due to their long,
linear structure.

Globular proteins (e.g., hemoglobin, enzymes) are soluble in water because they
have hydrophilic outer surfaces.

B. Shape

Proteins can be fibrous (elongated) or globular (spherical) depending on their
function and structure.
