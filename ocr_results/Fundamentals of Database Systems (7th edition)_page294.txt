with a NULL value. We can apply an operation LEFT OUTER JOIN, denoted by >, to
retrieve the result as follows:

TEMP < (EMPLOYEE 4 g5n,-\gr_ ssn EPARTMENT)
RESULT < Tername, Minit, Lname, Dname(TEMP)

The LEFT OUTER JOIN operation keeps every tuple in the first, or left, relation R in R™S;
if no matching tuple is found in S, then the attributes of S in the join result are filled or
padded with NULL values. The result of these operations is shown in Figure 8.12.

A similar operation, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, denoted by >, keeps every tuple in the
second, or right, relation S in the result of R » S. A third operation, FULL OUTER
JOIN, denoted by >¢, keeps all tuples in both the left and the right relations when no
matching tuples are found, padding them with NULL values as needed. The three
outer join operations are part of the SQL2 standard (see Section 7.1.6). These oper-
ations were provided later as an extension of relational algebra in response to the
typical need in business applications to show related information from multiple
tables exhaustively. Sometimes a complete reporting of data from multiple tables is
required whether or not there are matching values.

8.4.5 The OUTER UNION Operation

The OUTER UNION operation was developed to take the union of tuples from two
relations that have some common attributes, but are not union (type) compatible.
This operation will take the UNION of tuples in two relations R(X, Y) and S(X, Z)
that are partially compatible, meaning that only some of their attributes, say X, are
union compatible. The attributes that are union compatible are represented only
once in the result, and those attributes that are not union compatible from either
relation are also kept in the result relation T(X, Y, Z). It is therefore the same as a
FULL OUTER JOIN on the common attributes.

Two tuples t; in R and ft, in S are said to match if t,[X] = t;[X]. These will be com-
bined (unioned) into a single tuple in ¢. Tuples in either relation that have no
matching tuple in the other relation are padded with NULL values. For example, an
