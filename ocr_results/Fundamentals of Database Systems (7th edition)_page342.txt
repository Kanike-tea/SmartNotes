Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques

other necessary information are included as parameters in the function calls.
This approach provides what is known as an application programming
interface (API) for accessing a database from application programs. For
object-oriented programming languages (OOPLs), a class library is used.
For example, Java has the JDBC class library, which can generate various
types of objects such as: connection objects to a particular database, query
objects, and query result objects. Each type of object has a set of operations
associated with the class corresponding to the object.

3. Designing a brand-new language. A database programming language is
designed from scratch to be compatible with the database model and query
language. Additional programming structures such as loops and conditional
statements are added to the database language to convert it into a full-fledged
programming language. An example of this approach is Oracle’s PL/SQL. The
SQL standard has the SQL/PSM language for specifying stored procedures.

In practice, the first two approaches are more common, since many applications
are already written in general-purpose programming languages but require some
database access. The third approach is more appropriate for applications that have
intensive database interaction. One of the main problems with the first two
approaches is impedance mismatch, which does not occur in the third approach.

10.1.2 Impedance Mismatch

Impedance mismatch is the term used to refer to the problems that occur because
of differences between the database model and the programming language model.
For example, the practical relational model has three main constructs: columns
(attributes) and their data types, rows (also referred to as tuples or records), and
tables (sets or multisets of records). The first problem that may occur is that the
data types of the programming language differ from the attribute data types that are
available in the data model. Hence, it is necessary to have a binding for each host
programming language that specifies for each attribute type the compatible pro-
gramming language types. A different binding is needed for each programming lan-
guage because different languages have different data types. For example, the data
types available in C/C++ and Java are different, and both differ from the SQL data
types, which are the standard data types for relational databases.

Another problem occurs because the results of most queries are sets or multisets of
tuples (rows), and each tuple is formed of a sequence of attribute values. In the pro-
gram, it is often necessary to access the individual data values within individual
tuples for printing or processing. Hence, a binding is needed to map the query result
data structure, which is a table, to an appropriate data structure in the program-
ming language. A mechanism is needed to loop over the tuples in a query result in
order to access a single tuple at a time and to extract individual values from the
tuple. The extracted attribute values are typically copied to appropriate program
variables for further processing by the program. A cursor or iterator variable is
typically used to loop over the tuples in a query result. Individual values within each
tuple are then extracted into distinct program variables of the appropriate type.
