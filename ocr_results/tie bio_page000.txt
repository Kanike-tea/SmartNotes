1. Explain the bio functions of carbohydrates.
Answer:

Carbohydrates:

« Carbohydrates are biomolecules consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.
e It is mainly found in plant foods in the form of glucose and in dairy products in the
form of lactose.

There are five primary functions of carbohydrates in the human body. They are energy
production, energy storage, building macromolecules, sparing protein, and assisting in lipid
metabolism.

The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells in the body. Many cells
prefer glucose as a source of energy versus other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells,
such as red blood cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose.

If the body already has enough energy to support its functions, the excess glucose is stored as
glycogen (the majority of which is stored in the muscles and liver). A molecule of glycogen
may contain in excess of fifty thousand single glucose units and is highly branched, allowing
for the rapid dissemination of glucose when it is needed to make cellular energy.

Although most absorbed glucose is used to make energy, some glucose is converted to ribose
and deoxyribose, which are essential building blocks of important macromolecules, such as
RNA, DNA, and ATP.

Ina situation where there is not enough glucose to meet the body’s needs, glucose is
synthesized from amino acids.

As blood-glucose levels rise, the use of lipids as an energy source is inhibited. Thus, glucose
additionally has a “‘fat-sparing” effect. This is because an increase in blood glucose stimulates
release of the hormone insulin, which tells cells to use glucose (instead of lipids) to make
energy.

Carbohydrates are critical to support life’s most basic function—the production of energy.
Functions of carbohydrates:

¢ Carbohydrates are helpful in performing many functions such as breakdown of
protein molecules, dehydration as well as eliminating ketosis.
