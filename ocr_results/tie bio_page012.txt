4. Discuss the engineering solutions for Parkinson’s disease.
Answer:

Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of
the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely
noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause
stiffness or slowing of movement.

In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or die.
Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in
your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes atypical brain activity,
leading to impaired movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS TO THIS DISEASE ARE:

Deep Brain Stimulation — Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) involves surgically implanting a
neurotransmitter that sends electrical impulses to specific areas of your brain. This procedure
has helped many people with Parkinson's reduce symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and
bradykinesia. There are six main types of medications available to treat symptoms of
Parkinson disease: levodopa, dopamine agonists, and inhibitors of enzymes that inactivate
dopamine (monoamine oxidase type B [MAO B] inhibitors and catechol-O-methyl
transferase [COMT] inhibitors, anticholinergic drugs, and amantadine.

ENGINEERING NEURONS are another treatment method for this.

Transplantation of embryonic neurons can restore functional dopaminergic neurons in the
brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. But while promising, cell transplantation therapy
is still out of reach to most patients, in part because of the inaccessibility of human
embryonic tissue.

First obtained neuronal stem cells from mouse cells transfected with a transcription factor
that encourages cells to adopt a neuronal fate. They then co-cultured the cells with astrocytes,
which release a factor that induces development into dopaminergic neurons. The engineered
cells released dopamine, and some maintained the characteristics of dopaminergic neurons
for up to two weeks after implantation into mouse brains.

5. Define EEG. Briefly explain the procedure of EEG.
Answer:

An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain using
small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to the scalp. Brain cells communicate via electrical
impulses and are active all the time, even during asleep. This activity shows up as wavy lines
on an EEG recording.
An EEG is one of the main diagnostic tests for epilepsy. An EEG can also play a role in
diagnosing other brain disorders.
An EEG can find changes in brain activity that might be useful in diagnosing brain disorders,
especially epilepsy or another seizure disorder. An EEG might also be helpful for diagnosing
or treating:
