25.6.2 Big Data in Cloud Computing

The cloud computing movement and the big data movement have been proceeding
concurrently for more than a decade. It is not possible to address the details of
cloud computing issues in the present context. However, we state some compelling
reasons why big data technology is in some sense dependent on cloud technology
not only for its further expansion, but for its continued existence.

= The cloud model affords a high degree of flexibility in terms of management
of resources: “scaling out,” which refers to adding more nodes or resources;
“scaling up,” which refers to adding more resources to a node in the system;
or even downgrading are easily handled almost instantaneously.

= The resources are interchangeable; this fact, coupled with the design of dis-
tributed software, creates a good ecosystem where failure can be absorbed
easily and where virtual computing instances can be left unperturbed. For
the cost of a few hundred dollars, it is possible to perform data mining oper-
ations that involve complete scans of terabyte databases, and to crawl huge
Web sites that contain millions of pages.

= It is not uncommon for big data projects to exhibit unpredictable or peak
computing power and storage needs. These projects are faced with the chal-
lenge of providing for this peak demand on an as-needed and not necessar-
ily continuous basis. At the same time, business stakeholders expect swift,
inexpensive, and dependable products and project outcomes. To meet with
these conflicting requirements, cloud services offer an ideal solution.

= A common situation in which cloud services and big data go hand-in-hand
is as follows: Data is transferred to or collected in a cloud data storage sys-
tem, like Amazon’s $3, for the purpose of collecting log files or exporting
text-formatted data. Alternatively, database adapters can be utilized to
access data from databases in the cloud. Data processing frameworks like
Pig, Hive, and MapReduce, which we described above in Section 25.4, are
used to analyze raw data (which may have originated in the cloud).

= Big data projects and startup companies benefit a great deal from using a
cloud storage service. They can trade capital expenditure for operational
expenditure; this is an excellent trade because it requires no capital outlay or
risk. Cloud storage provides reliable and scalable storage solutions of a qual-
ity otherwise unachievable.

= Cloud services and resources are globally distributed. They ensure high avail-
ability and durability unattainable by most but the largest organizations.

The Netflix Case for Marrying Cloud and Big Data.?* Netflix is a large orga-
