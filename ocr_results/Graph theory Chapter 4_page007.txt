41. Minimal Spanning Tree 221

Since the graph has 8 vertices, there should be 7 edges in its minimal ‘spanning tree. Let
us put the edges of the graph in a non-decreasing order of their weights and select seven edges
one by one in such a way that no cycle is created. The scheme is summarized in the following
Table.

FG [AD | BC | CD| EF | FH | AB | GH
140 | 145 | 145 | 150 | 150 | 150 [155 | 160
Yes | No | Yes | Yes No | Yes |
Thus, a minimal spanning tree of the given graph consists of the branches CE, DF, AG,

FG, BC, CD, FH. This tree represents the required railway net work. The network is shown
in Figure 4.12.

The cost involved is
95 + 100 + 120 + 140 + 145 + 150 + 150 = 900 (in crores of Rupees) rT]

(2) Prim’s Algorithm
The Working Rule for the Prim’s method (usually called Prim’s algorithm) may be stated
4 follows:

Step 1. Given a connected, weighted graph G with n vertices, assign n names (say: V1, V2,..- Vas
or A,B,C and so on) to these vertices, and prepare an xn Table in which the weights of
all edges are shown. The entries in the Table will be symmetric with respect to the di-
agonal and no entries appear on the diagonal. Indicate the weights of the non-existing
edges as 00,

bour (.e,; to the vertex-which has the smallest entry)-in the vj-row, say: vg. : Now,
