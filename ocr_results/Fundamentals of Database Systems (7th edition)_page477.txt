technology for realization of the Semantic Web, where all information in the
Web can be intelligently located and processed.

= The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) can be used to define how a docu-
ment should be rendered for display by a Web browser.

= The Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) can be
used to transform one structure into a different structure. Hence, it can con-
vert documents from one form to another.

= The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) allows for the description
of Web Services in XML. This makes the Web Service available to users and
programs over the Web.

= The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a platform-independent and
programming language-independent protocol for messaging and remote
procedure calls.

= The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides languages and tools
for exchanging and processing of meta-data (schema) descriptions and
specifications over the Web.

13.6.1 Creating Hierarchical XML Views over
Flat or Graph-Based Data

This section discusses the representational issues that arise when converting data
from a database system into XML documents. As we have discussed, XML uses a
hierarchical (tree) model to represent documents. The database systems with the
most widespread use follow the flat relational data model. When we add referential
