mean the subordinate of some subordinate down to any number of levels. Thus
SUPERIOR(X, Y) stands for the fact that X is a superior of Y through direct or indirect
supervision. We can write two rules that together specify the meaning of the new
predicate. The first rule under Rules in the figure states that for every value of X and
Y, if SUPERVISE(X, Y)—the rule body—is true, then SUPERIOR(X, Y)—the rule
head—is also true, since Y would be a direct subordinate of X (at one level down).
This rule can be used to generate all direct superior/subordinate relationships from
the facts that define the SUPERVISE predicate. The second recursive rule states that if
SUPERVISE(X, Z) and SUPERIOR(Z, Y) are both true, then SUPERIOR(X, Y) is also
true. This is an example of a recursive rule, where one of the rule body predicates in
the RHS is the same as the rule head predicate in the LHS. In general, the rule body
defines a number of premises such that if they are all true, we can deduce that the
conclusion in the rule head is also true. Notice that if we have two (or more) rules
with the same head (LHS predicate), it is equivalent to saying that the predicate is
true (that is, that it can be instantiated) if either one of the bodies is true; hence, it is
equivalent to a logical OR operation. For example, if we have two rules X :- Y and
X :- Z, they are equivalent to a rule X :- Y OR Z. The latter form is not used in deduc-
tive systems, however, because it is not in the standard form of rule, called a Horn
clause, as we discuss in Section 26.5.4.

A Prolog system contains a number of built-in predicates that the system can inter-
pret directly. These typically include the equality comparison operator = (X, Y),
which returns true if X and Y are identical and can also be written as X = Y by using
the standard infix notation.*! Other comparison operators for numbers, such as
<, <=, >, and >=, can be treated as binary predicates. Arithmetic functions such as
+,-,*, and / can be used as arguments in predicates in Prolog. In contrast, Datalog
(in its basic form) does not allow functions such as arithmetic operations as argu-
ments; indeed, this is one of the main differences between Prolog and Datalog.
However, extensions to Datalog have been proposed that do include functions.

A query typically involves a predicate symbol with some variable arguments, and
its meaning (or answer) is to deduce all the different constant combinations that,
when bound (assigned) to the variables, can make the predicate true. For example,
the first query in Figure 26.11 requests the names of all subordinates of james at any
level. A different type of query, which has only constant symbols as arguments,
returns either a true or a false result, depending on whether the arguments pro-
vided can be deduced from the facts and rules. For example, the second query in
Figure 26.11 returns true, since SUPERIOR(james, joyce) can be deduced.

26.5.3 Datalog Notation

In Datalog, as in other logic-based languages, a program is built from basic objects
called atomic formulas. It is customary to define the syntax of logic-based lan-
guages by describing the syntax of atomic formulas and identifying how they can be
combined to form a program. In Datalog, atomic formulas are literals of the form

31,4 Prolog system typically has a number of different equality predicates that have different interpretations.
