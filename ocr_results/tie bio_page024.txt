SONARS:

+ Sonar (SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation
(usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, measure distances
(ranging), communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water,
such as Ships and Submarines.

* "Sonar" can refer to one of two types of technology:

* Passive sonar means listening for the sound made by vessels;

* Active sonar means emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes.
* The method is called diagnostic imaging by echolocation.

+ Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo
characteristics of "targets" in the water.

2. Briefly discuss the mechanism of super hydrophobic and self-cleaning surfaces.
Answer:

SUPERHYDROPHOBIC AND SELF-CLEANING SURFACES:
The self-cleaning function of superhydrophobic surfaces is conventionally attributed to the

removal of contaminating particles by impacting or rolling water droplets, which implies the
action of external forces such as gravity. Here, we demonstrate a unique self-cleaning
mechanism whereby the contaminated superhydrophobic surface is exposed to condensing
water vapor, and the contaminants are autonomously removed by the self-propelled jumping
motion of the resulting liquid condensate, which partially covers or fully encloses the
contaminating particles. The jumping motion of the superhydrophobic surface is powered by
the surface energy released upon the coalescence of the condensed water phase around the
contaminants. The jumping-condensate mechanism is shown to spontaneously clean
superhydrophobic cicada wings, where the contaminating particles cannot be removed by
gravity, wing vibration, or wind flow. Our findings offer insights into the development of
self-cleaning materials.

Mechanism:

An autonomous mechanism to achieve self-cleaning on superhydrophobic surfaces, where the
contaminants are removed by self-propelled jumping condensate powered by surface energy.
When exposed to condensing water vapor, the contaminating particles are either fully
enclosed or partially covered with the resulting liquid condensate. Building upon our
previous publications
