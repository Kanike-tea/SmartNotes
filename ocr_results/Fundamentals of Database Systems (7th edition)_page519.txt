14.5 Boyce-Codd Normal Form

and A being a prime attribute will R be in 3NF but not in BCNF. The relation schema
R shown in Figure 14.13(b) illustrates the general case of such a relation. Such
an f.d. leads to potential redundancy of data, as we illustrated above in case of
FD5: Area > County_name.in LOTSA relation. Ideally, relational database design
should strive to achieve BCNF or 3NF for every relation schema. Achieving the normal-
ization status of just INF or 2NF is not considered adequate, since both were developed
historically to be intermediate normal forms as stepping stones to 3NF and BCNF.

14.5.1 Decomposition of Relations not in BCNF

As another example, consider Figure 14.14, which shows a relation TEACH with the
following dependencies:

FD1: {Student, Course} — Instructor
FD2:!4 Instructor > Course

Note that {Student, Course} is a candidate key for this relation and that the depen-
dencies shown follow the pattern in Figure 14.13(b), with Student as A, Course as B,
and Instructor as C. Hence this relation is in 3NF but not BCNF. Decomposition of
this relation schema into two schemas is not straightforward because it may be
decomposed into one of the three following possible pairs:

1. R1 (Student, Instructor) and R2(Student, Course)

2. R1 (Course, Instructor) and R2(Course, Student)
3. RI (Instructor, Course) and R2(Instructor, Student)

All three decompositions lose the functional dependency FD1. The question then
becomes: Which of the above three is a desirable decomposition? As we pointed out
earlier (Section 14.3.1), we strive to meet two properties of decomposition during
