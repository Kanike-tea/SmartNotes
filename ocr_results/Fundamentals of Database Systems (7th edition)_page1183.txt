that it is signing, together with a timestamp. To be unique to each signer and coun-
terfeitproof, each digital signature must also depend on some secret number that is
unique to the signer. Thus, in general, a counterfeitproof digital signature must
depend on the message and a unique secret number of the signer. The verifier of the
signature, however, should not need to know any secret number. Public key tech-
niques are the best means of creating digital signatures with these properties.

30.7.5 Digital Certificates

A digital certificate is used to combine the value of a public key with the identity of
the person or service that holds the corresponding private key into a digitally signed
statement. Certificates are issued and signed by a certification authority (CA). The
entity receiving this certificate from a CA is the subject of that certificate. Instead of
requiring each participant in an application to authenticate every user, third-party
authentication relies on the use of digital certificates.

The digital certificate itself contains various types of information. For example,
both the certification authority and the certificate owner information are included.
The following list describes all the information included in the certificate:

1. The certificate owner information, which is represented by a unique identi-
fier known as the distinguished name (DN) of the owner. This includes the
owner’s name, as well as the owner’s organization and other information
about the owner.

2. The certificate also includes the public key of the owner.
3. The date of issue of the certificate is also included.

4. The validity period is specified by ‘Valid From’ and ‘Valid To’ dates, which
are included in each certificate.

5. Issuer identifier information is included in the certificate.

6. Finally, the digital signature of the issuing CA for the certificate is included.
All the information listed is encoded through a message-digest function,
which creates the digital signature. The digital signature basically certifies
that the association between the certificate owner and public key is valid.

30.8 Privacy Issues and Preservation

Preserving data privacy is a growing challenge for database security and privacy
experts. In some perspectives, to preserve data privacy we should even limit per-
forming large-scale data mining and analysis. The most commonly used techniques
to address this concern are to avoid building mammoth central warehouses as a
single repository of vital information. This is one of the stumbling blocks for creat-
ing nationwide registries of patients for many important diseases. Another possible
measure is to intentionally modify or perturb data.

If all data were available at a single warehouse, violating only a single repository’s
security could expose all data. Avoiding central warehouses and using distributed
