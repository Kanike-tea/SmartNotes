Static random access memory (SRAM) :
e It is faster than the more traditional DRAM, but requires more silicon area.
e¢ SRAM is static so that it does not require refreshing.
e The access time for SRAM is considerably shorter than the equivalent DRAM
because SRAM does not require a pause between data accesses.
e The cost is high hence; it is used for smaller high-speed tasks, such as fast memory
and caches.
Synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM):
e  Jtcan run at much higher clock speeds than conventional memory.
e¢ SDRAM synchronizes itself with the processor bus because it is clocked.
e Internally the data is fetched from memory cells, pipelined, and finally brought out on
the bus in a burst.

e The old-style DRAM is asynchronous, so does not burst as efficiently as SDRAM.

44 Peripherals
In Embedded systems the peripherals are used to interact with the outside world. A peripheral
device performs input and output functions for the chip by connecting to other devices or
sensors that are off-chip. Each peripheral device usually performs a single function and may
reside on-chip.
Peripherals range from a simple serial communication device to a more complex 802.11
wireless device.
All ARM peripherals are memory mapped; the programming interface is a set of Memory
addressed registers. The address of these registers is an offset from a specific peripheral base
address.
Controllers are specialized peripherals that implement higher levels of functionality within an
embedded system. Two important types of controllers are memory controllers and interrupt
controllers.

1. Memory Controllers
Memory controllers connect different types of memory to the processor bus. On power-up, a
memory controller is configured in hardware to allow certain memory devices to be active.
These memory devices allow the initialization code to be executed. Some memory devices
must be set up by software; for example, when using DRAM, first have to set up the memory

timings and refresh rate before it can be accessed.
