XML: Extensible
Markup Language

Mi any Internet applications provide Web inter-
faces to access information stored in one or

more databases. These databases are often referred to as data sources. It is common
to use the three-tier client/server architectures for Internet applications (see Sec-
tion 2.5). Internet database applications are designed to interact with the user through
Web interfaces that display Web pages on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.
The common method of specifying the contents and formatting of Web pages is
through the use of hypertext documents. There are various languages for writing
these documents, the most common being HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
Although HTML is widely used for formatting and structuring Web documents, it
is not suitable for specifying structured data that is extracted from databases. A new
language—namely, XML (Extensible Markup Language)—has emerged as the stan-
dard for structuring and exchanging data over the Web in text files. Another lan-
guage that can be used for the same purpose is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation;
see Section 11.4). XML can be used to provide information about the structure and
meaning of the data in the Web pages rather than just specifying how the Web
pages are formatted for display on the screen. Both XML and JSON documents
provide descriptive information, such as attribute names, as well as the values of
these attributes, in a text file; hence, they are known as self-describing documents.
The formatting aspects of Web pages are specified separately—for example, by
using a formatting language such as XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) or a
transformation language such as XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language for Trans-
formations or simply XSL Transformations). Recently, XML has also been pro-
posed as a possible model for data storage and retrieval, although only a few
experimental database systems based on XML have been developed so far.
