Preface

and algorithms developed for relational database design by normaliza-
tion, including the relational decomposition algorithms and the relational
synthesis algorithms.

Part 7 (Chapters 16 and 17) contains the chapters on file organizations on
disk (Chapter 16) and indexing of database files (Chapter 17). Chapter 16
describes primary methods of organizing files of records on disk, including
ordered (sorted), unordered (heap), and hashed files; both static and
dynamic hashing techniques for disk files are covered. Chapter 16 has been
updated to include materials on buffer management strategies for DBMSs as
well as an overview of new storage devices and standards for files and mod-
ern storage architectures. Chapter 17 describes indexing techniques for files,
including B-tree and B*-tree data structures and grid files, and has been
updated with new examples and an enhanced discussion on indexing,
including how to choose appropriate indexes and index creation during
physical design.

Part 8 (Chapters 18 and 19) includes the chapters on query processing algo-
rithms (Chapter 18) and optimization techniques (Chapter 19); these two
chapters have been updated and reorganized from the single chapter that
covered both topics in the previous editions and include some of the newer
techniques that are used in commercial DBMSs. Chapter 18 presents algo-
rithms for searching for records on disk files, and for joining records from
two files (tables), as well as for other relational operations. Chapter 18 con-
tains new material, including a discussion of the semi-join and anti-join
operations with examples of how they are used in query processing, as well
as a discussion of techniques for selectivity estimation. Chapter 19 covers
techniques for query optimization using cost estimation and heuristic rules;
it includes new material on nested subquery optimization, use of histograms,
physical optimization, and join ordering methods and optimization of
typical queries in data warehouses.

Part 9 (Chapters 20, 21, and 22) covers transaction processing concepts;
concurrency control; and database recovery from failures. These chapters
have been updated to include some of the newer techniques that are used
in some commercial and open source DBMSs. Chapter 20 introduces the
techniques needed for transaction processing systems, and defines the
concepts of recoverability and serializability of schedules; it has a new sec-
tion on buffer replacement policies for DBMSs and a new discussion on
the concept of snapshot isolation. Chapter 21 gives an overview of the var-
ious types of concurrency control protocols, with a focus on two-phase
locking. We also discuss timestamp ordering and optimistic concurrency
control techniques, as well as multiple-granularity locking. Chapter 21
includes a new presentation of concurrency control methods that are based
on the snapshot isolation concept. Finally, Chapter 23 focuses on database
recovery protocols, and gives an overview of the concepts and techniques
that are used in recovery.
