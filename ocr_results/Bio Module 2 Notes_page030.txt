dishwashing, amylases facilitate the removal of starch-containing stains, e.g., pasta, potato,
gravy, chocolate, and baby food. Amylases also prevent swollen starch from adhering to the
surface of laundry and dishes that may otherwise act as a glue for particulate soiling.
Complexes or reaction products between protein, starch, and/or fat are usually found in
prepared foods. In such cases, enzyme synergy effects make it possible to remove soil even

more efficiently than with single enzyme systems.

Cellulases

Cellulases cleave B-1,4-glucosidic bonds in cellulose and operate directly on the natural cotton
fibers or cotton/flax blends and on the cellulose portion in synthetic fibers. Cellulases are
applied in detergents to make cotton fabrics regain and maintain clear colors, a smooth surface,
and softness. Cellulases provide these effects by shaving off the fuzz and pills of cotton fibrils
that are generated on the fabric by normal wear and washing. Cellulases are unique in providing

these effects.

Lipases

Because of their strong hydrophobicity, fats and oils are difficult to remove from laundry at
low temperatures. Lipases hydrolyze triglyceride to more hydrophilic mono- and diglycerides,
free fatty acids, and glycerol. These hydrolysis products are all soluble in alkaline conditions.

n laundering, the effects of lipases are seen only after several wash cycles.

Application of Enzymes in Textile Industry
Enzymes, such as cellulases, catalase, and laccase, are commonly used in the textile industry.

These enzymes are used to removing the starch, degrading excess hydrogen peroxide,

leaching textiles and degrading lignin. Because of the highly specific, efficient, non-toxic,
and eco-friendly characteristics, the use of enzymes in the textile industry is rapidly growing.
The application of cellulases for denim finishing and lactases for decolorization of textile
effluents and textile bleaching are the most recent commercial advances. Furthermore, the use
of enzymes results in reduced process times, energy and water savings, improved product

quality and potential process integration.
