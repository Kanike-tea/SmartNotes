¢ To read the state of the cell, the word-line is activated.
¢ A Sense circuit at the end of the bit-line generates the proper output value.

TYPES OF ROM
© Different types of non-volatile memory are
1) PROM
2) EPROM
3) EEPROM &
4) Flash Memory (Flash Cards & Flash Drives)

PROM (PROGRAMMABLE ROM)
* PROM allows the data to be loaded by the user.
© Programmability is achieved by inserting a ,,fuse" at point P ina ROM cell.
© Before PROM is programmed, the memory contains all 0“s.
© User can insert 1"s at required location by burning-out fuse using highcurrent-pulse.
© This process is irreversible.
« Advantages:
1) It provides flexibility.
2) It is faster.
3) It is less expensive because they can be programmed directly by the user.

EPROM (ERASABLE REPROGRAMMABLE ROM)
© EPROM allows
— stored data to be erased and
— new data to be loaded.
¢ In cell, a connection to ground is always made at ,,P" and a special transistor is used.
¢ The transistor has the ability to function as
— anormal transistor or
— a disabled transistor that is always turned ,,off".
Transistor can be programmed to behave as a permanently open switch, by injecting charge into it.
Erasure requires dissipating the charges trapped in the transistor of memory-cells. This
can be done by exposing the chip to ultra-violet light.
« Advantages:
1) It provides flexibility during the development-phase of digital-system.
2) It is capable of retaining the stored information for a long time.
© Disadvantages:
1) The chip must be physically removed from the circuit for reprogramming.
2) The entire contents need to be erased by UV light.
