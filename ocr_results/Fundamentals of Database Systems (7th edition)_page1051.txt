Introduction to Information
Retrieval and Web Search

n most of the chapters in this book so far, we have

discussed techniques for modeling, designing, query-
ing, transaction processing of, and managing structured data. In Section 13.1, we
discussed the differences among structured, semistructured, and unstructured data.
Information retrieval deals mainly with unstructured data, and the techniques for
indexing, searching, and retrieving information from large collections of unstruc-
tured documents. In Chapter 24, on NOSQL technologies, we considered systems,
like MongoDB, that are suited to handling data in the form of documents. In this
chapter, we will provide an introduction to information retrieval. This is a very
broad topic, so we will focus on the similarities and differences between informa-
tion retrieval and database technologies, and on the indexing techniques that form
the basis of many information retrieval systems.

This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 27.1, we introduce information
retrieval (IR) concepts and discuss how IR differs from traditional databases. Sec-
tion 27.2 is devoted to a discussion of retrieval models, which form the basis for IR
search. Section 27.3 covers different types of queries in IR systems. Section 27.4
discusses text preprocessing, and Section 27.5 provides an overview of IR indexing,
which is at the heart of any IR system. In Section 27.6, we describe the various
evaluation metrics for IR systems performance. Section 27.7 details Web analysis
and its relationship to information retrieval, and Section 27.8 briefly introduces the
current trends in IR. Section 27.9 summarizes the chapter. For a limited overview of
IR, we suggest that students read Sections 27.1 through 27.6.
