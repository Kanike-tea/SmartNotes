Chapter 30 Database Security

reflects the sensitivity of the row as per the policy. Similar to MAC (mandatory
access control), where each user has a security clearance, each user has an identity
in label-based security. This user’s identity is compared to the label assigned to each
row to determine whether the user has access to view the contents of that row.
However, the user can write the label value himself, within certain restrictions and
guidelines for that specific row. This label can be set to a value that is between the
user’s current session label and the user’s minimum level. The DBA has the privi-
lege to set an initial default row label.

The label security requirements are applied on top of the DAC requirements for
each user. Hence, the user must satisfy the DAC requirements and then the label
security requirements to access a row. The DAC requirements make sure that the
user is legally authorized to carry on that operation on the schema. In most applica-
tions, only some of the tables need label-based security. For the majority of the
application tables, the protection provided by DAC is sufficient.

Security policies are generally created by managers and human resources person-
nel. The policies are high-level, technology neutral, and relate to risks. Policies are a
result of management instructions to specify organizational procedures, guiding
principles, and courses of action that are considered to be expedient, prudent, or
advantageous. Policies are typically accompanied by a definition of penalties and
countermeasures if the policy is transgressed. These policies are then interpreted
and converted to a set of label-oriented policies by the label security administrator,
who defines the security labels for data and authorizations for users; these labels
and authorizations govern access to specified protected objects.

Suppose a user has SELECT privileges on a table. When the user executes a SELECT
statement on that table, label security will automatically evaluate each row returned
by the query to determine whether the user has rights to view the data. For example,
if the user has a sensitivity of 20, then the user can view all rows having a security
level of 20 or lower. The level determines the sensitivity of the information con-
tained in a row; the more sensitive the row, the higher its security label value. Such
label security can be configured to perform security checks on UPDATE, DELETE,
and INSERT statements as well.

30.3.4 XML Access Control

With the worldwide use of XML in commercial and scientific applications, efforts
are under way to develop security standards. Among these efforts are digital signa-
tures and encryption standards for XML. The XML Signature Syntax and Process-
ing specification describes an XML syntax for representing the associations between
cryptographic signatures and XML documents or other electronic resources. The
specification also includes procedures for computing and verifying XML signa-
tures. An XML digital signature differs from other protocols for message signing,
such as OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy—a confidentiality and authentication ser-
vice that can be used for electronic mail and file storage application), in its support
for signing only specific portions of the XML tree (see Chapter 13) rather than the
