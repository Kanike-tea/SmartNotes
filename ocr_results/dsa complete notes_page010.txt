Multi dimensional arrays

Two dimensional arrays: C uses the array of array representation to represent a multidimensional
array. In this representation a 2 dimensional array is represented as a one dimensional array in which
each element is itself a one dimensional array.
e A two dimensional m X n array A is a collection of m* n data elements such that each element
is specified by a pair of integers called subscripts.
An element with subscript i and j will be represented as A[i][j
Declaration: int A[3][5];
// It declares an array A that contains three elements where each element is a one
dimensional array. Each one dimensional array has 5 integer elements.

Example : A 2 dimensional array A[3][4] is represented as

0 1 2 3
© | AfO}(0] | ALOI[1] | ALO][2] | ALO][3]
Rows 1 | A[1J[0] | AL1[1) | Al1J[2] | ALJ)
2 LAL2I10] | A211 | AL2I12) | A2I3)

REPESentationlohiWwoldimensionallaraysummiemory: A two dimensional m X narray A is stored

in the memory as a collection of m*n sequential memory locations.If the array is stored column by
column it is called column major order and if the array is stored row by row it is called row major
order.

Example: Representation of the two dimensional array A[3][4] in row major order and column major
order
A Subscript A Subscript
A[0][0 A[0][0. Column!
A(O][1 A[1][0.
AOI ROO A[2I[0.
A[O}[3 A(O}{1 Column2
A{1][0. AU

e Using the base address , the address of any element in an array A of size row X col can be
calculated using the formula.
e Row Major order
Address (A[i][j]) = Base address + w[ i*col+ j] considering the array indexing starts at 0
e Column Major order
Address (A[i][j]) = Base address + w[ i+row.j] considering the array indexing starts at 0
