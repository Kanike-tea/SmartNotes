27.7 Web Search and Analysis

up at a particular page. PageRank is a measure of the query-independent importance
of a page/node. For example, let P(X) be the PageRank of any page X and C(X) be
the number of outgoing links from page X, and let d be the damping factor in the range
0<d <1. Usually dis set to 0.85. Then PageRank for a page A can be calculated as:

P(A) = (1 = d) + d(P(T,)/C(T,) + P(T,)/C(Ty)+... + P(T,)IC(T,,))

Here T}, To, ..., T,, are the pages that point to Page A (that is, are citations to page A).
PageRank forms a probability distribution over Web pages, so the sum of all Web
pages’ PageRanks is one.

The HITS Ranking Algorithm. The HITS” algorithm proposed by Jon Kleinberg
is another type of ranking algorithm exploiting the link structure of the Web. The
algorithm presumes that a good hub is a document that points to many hubs, and a
good authority is a document that is pointed at by many other authorities. The
algorithm contains two main steps: a sampling component and a weight-propagation
component. The sampling component constructs a focused collection S of pages
with the following properties:

1. Sis relatively small.
2. Sis rich in relevant pages.
3. S contains most (or a majority) of the strongest authorities.
The weight component recursively calculates the hub and authority values for each
document as follows:
1. Initialize hub and authority values for all pages in S by setting them to 1.
2. While (hub and authority values do not converge):
a. For each page in S, calculate authority value = Sum of hub values of all
pages pointing to the current page.
b. For each page in S, calculate hub value = Sum of authority values of all
pages pointed at by the current page.

c. Normalize hub and authority values such that sum of all hub values in $
equals 1 and the sum of all authority values in $ equals 1.

27.7.4 Web Content Analysis

As mentioned earlier, Web content analysis refers to the process of discovering use-
ful information from Web content/data/documents. The Web content data consists
of unstructured data such as free text from electronically stored documents, semi-
structured data typically found as HTML documents with embedded image data,
and more structured data such as tabular data and pages in HTML, XML, or other
markup languages generated as output from databases. More generally, the term
Web content refers to any real data in the Web page that is intended for the user
accessing that page. This usually consists of but is not limited to text and graphics.
