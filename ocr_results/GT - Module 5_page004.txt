25. 5. Graph Colouring 133

p Thecycle being considered is shown in Figure 2.40. Obviously, this cycle cannot be properly
coloured with a single colour. Assign two colours alternatively to the vertices, starting with v;
Then, the odd vertices v;, v3, vs etc,, will have one colour a and the even vertices v2, v4, vg ete
will have a different colour f.
Suppose n is even. Then the vertex v, is an even vertex and therefore will have the colour
Jjacent vertices v, and v, have different ky

colours). Therefore, the cycle is 2-chromatic
Suppose n is odd Then the vertex v,, is an odd vertex and therefore will have the colour @
and the cycle is not properly coloured (because, then, the adjacent vertices v, and v, will have
the same colour a) To make the cycle properly coloured, it is enough if v, is assigned a third

colour y. Thus, in this case, the cycle is 3-chromatic

[Example 4] Find the chromatic number of the graph shown below

> We check that the given graph cannot be properly coloured with one or two colours, But it
can be properly coloured with three colours. For example, we can assign colour a to vertices
¥j and v3, colour f to vertices v2 and v4, and colour y to the vertex vs. Hence the chromatic
