The electronic tongue:

The electronic tongue is an instrument that measures and compares tastes.
Chemical compounds responsible for taste are detected by human taste buds and the 7
sensors of electronic instruments detect the same dissolved organic and inorganic
compounds.

Taste and smell are separate senses with their own receptor organs, yet they are
intimately entwined.

Tastants, chemicals in foods, are detected by taste buds, which consist of special
sensory cells.

When stimulated, these cells send signals to specific areas of the brain, which make us
conscious of the perception of taste.

Similarly, specialized cells in the nose pick up odorants -airborne odor molecules.
Odorants stimulate receptor proteins found on hair-like cilia at the tips of the sensory
cells, a process that initiates a neural response.

Ultimately, messages about taste and smell converge, allowing us to detect the flavors
of food.

APPLICATIONS FOR THE ELECTRONIC TONGUE
Electronic tongues have several applications in various industrial areas: the pharmaceutical
industry, food and beverage sector, etc. for:

1) Analyze flavor ageing in beverages (for instance fruit juice, alcoholic or non-
alcoholic drinks, flavored milks...)

2)Quantify bitterness or “spicy level” of drinks or dissolved compounds

3) Quantify taste masking efficiency of formulations (tablets, syrups, powders,
capsules, lozenges, etc.)

4)Analyze medicines stability in terms of taste

5)Benchmark target products

6)Monitor environmental parameters

7)Monitor biological and biochemical processes
