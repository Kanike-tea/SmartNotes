Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

all of them (for example, some cars or trucks may not be registered). In general,
a specialization or generalization such as that in Figure 4.3(b), if it were partial,
would not preclude VEHICLE from containing other types of entities, such as
motorcycles. However, a category such as REGISTERED_VEHICLE in Figure 4.8
implies that only cars and trucks, but not other types of entities, can be members
of REGISTERED_VEHICLE.

A category can be total or partial. A total category holds the union of all entities in
its superclasses, whereas a partial category can hold a subset of the union. A total
category is represented diagrammatically by a double line connecting the category
and the circle, whereas a partial category is indicated by a single line.

The superclasses of a category may have different key attributes, as demonstrated
by the OWNER category in Figure 4.8, or they may have the same key attribute, as
demonstrated by the REGISTERED_VEHICLE category. Notice that if a category is
total (not partial), it may be represented alternatively as a total specialization (or a
total generalization). In this case, the choice of which representation to use is sub-
jective. If the two classes represent the same type of entities and share numerous
attributes, including the same key attributes, specialization/generalization is pre-
ferred; otherwise, categorization (union type) is more appropriate.

It is important to note that some modeling methodologies do not have union
types. In these models, a union type must be represented in a roundabout way
(see Section 9.2).

4.5 A Sample UNIVERSITY EER Schema,
Design Choices, and Formal Definitions

In this section, we first give an example of a database schema in the EER model to
illustrate the use of the various concepts discussed here and in Chapter 3. Then, we
discuss design choices for conceptual schemas, and finally we summarize the EER
model concepts and define them formally in the same manner in which we formally
defined the concepts of the basic ER model in Chapter 3.

4.5.1 A Different UNIVERSITY Database Example

Consider a UNIVERSITY database that has different requirements from the UNIVERSITY
database presented in Section 3.10. This database keeps track of students and their
majors, transcripts, and registration as well as of the university’s course offerings.
The database also keeps track of the sponsored research projects of faculty and
graduate students. This schema is shown in Figure 4.9. A discussion of the require-
ments that led to this schema follows.

For each person, the database maintains information on the person’s Name [Name],
Social Security number [Ssn], address [Address], sex [Sex], and birth date [Bdate].
Two subclasses of the PERSON entity type are identified: FACULTY and STUDENT.
Specific attributes of FACULTY are rank [Rank] (assistant, associate, adjunct, research,
