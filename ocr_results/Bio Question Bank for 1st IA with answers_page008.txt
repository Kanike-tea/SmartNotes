and bases, and can be used in a wide range of water treatment applications.

e Large surface area: Cellulose-based water filters have a large surface area, which enhancestheir

filtration capabilities and reduces the frequency of filter replacement.

Advantages of cellulose-based water filters

Cellulose-based water filters have several advantages that make them an attractive option for

water filtration:

e Environmentally friendly: Cellulose-based water filters are made from a renewable resource,
cellulose, and are biodegradable, reducing their impact on the environment compared to synthetic
polymer filters.

¢ Cost-effective: Cellulose-based water filters are often more affordable than traditional synthetic
polymer filters, making them accessible to a wider range of consumers and communities.

e High porosity: Cellulose-based water filters have a high porosity structure, which allows them to
efficiently remove impurities and contaminants from water.

e Versatile: Cellulose-based water filters can be used in various types of filtration systems andcan be
produced in different sizes and shapes to fit specific needs.

¢ Good mechanical strength: Cellulose-based water filters have good mechanical strength,allowing
them to maintain their structure and perform effectively over time.

e Chemical resistance: Cellulose-based water filters are resistant to most chemicals, includingacids
and bases, and can be used in a wide range of water treatment applications.

e Large surface area: Cellulose-based water filters have a large surface area, which enhancestheir

filtration capabilities and reduces the frequency of filter replacement.

Limitations of cellulose-based water filters

Cellulose-based water filters have some limitations that need to be considered whenchoosing a

water filtration solution:

e Low resistance to high temperature: Cellulose-based water filters have low resistance to high
temperature and can lose their structural integrity when exposed to high temperatures.

e Low filtration efficiency for certain contaminants: Cellulose-based water filters may not be
efficient in removing certain contaminants, such as heavy metals, from water.

e Limited lifespan: Cellulose-based water filters have a limited lifespan and may need to bereplaced
more frequently compared to synthetic polymer filters.

e Difficult to sterilize: Cellulose-based water filters may be difficult to sterilize effectively,
