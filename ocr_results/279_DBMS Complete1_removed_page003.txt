Function of DBMS:

1. Defining database schema: it must give facility for defining the database structure also
specifies access rights to authorized users.

2. Manipulation of the database: The dbms must have functions like insertion of record into
database, updation of data, deletion of data, retrieval of data

3. Sharing of database: The DBMS must share data items for multiple users by maintaining
consistency of data.

4. Protection of database: It must protect the database against unauthorized users.

5. Database recovery: If for any reason the system fails DBMS must facilitate data base
recovery.

Reduction of redundancies:

Centralized control of data by the DBA avoids unnecessary duplication of data and effectively
reduces the total amount of data storage required avoiding duplication in the elimination of the
inconsistencies that tend to be present in redundant data files.

Sharing of Data:
A database allows the sharing of data under its control by any number of application programs or
users.

Data Integrity:
Data integrity means that the data contained in the database is both accurate and consistent.

Therefore data values being entered for storage could be checked to ensure that they fall with in a
specified range and are of the correct format.

Data Security:
The DBA who has the ultimate responsibility for the data in the dbms can ensure that proper access

procedures are followed including proper authentication to access to the DataBase System and
additional check before permitting access to sensitive data.

Conflict Resolution:
DBA resolve the conflict on requirements of various user and applications. The DBA chooses the
best file structure and access method to get optional performance for the application.

Data Independence:
Data independence is usually considered from two points of views; physically data independence

and logical data independence.

Physical Data Independence allows changes in the physical storage devices or organization of the
files to be made without requiring changes in the conceptual view or any of the external views and
hence in the application programs using the data base.

Logical Data Independence indicates that the conceptual schema can be changed without affecting
the existing external schema or any application program.
