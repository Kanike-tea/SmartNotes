3. Applications of Bio-Bleaching
A. Paper & Pulp Industry

¢ Replaces chlorine-based bleaching agents (like chlorine dioxide or hypochlorite).
¢ Improves the brightness of paper while reducing pollution.

¢ Reduces toxic by-products like dioxins and furans.

B. Textile Industry

e Used for whitening cotton, wool, and synthetic fabrics.
¢ Removes natural pigments from plant fibers like cotton and flax.

¢ Less fiber damage compared to traditional chemical bleaching.

C. Laundry & Cleaning Products

« Enzyme-based detergents help remove stains without harsh chemicals.
¢ Better stain removal from clothes (e.g., sweat, blood, food stains).

¢ Reduces energy and water consumption as enzymes work at lower temperatures.

4. Advantages of Bio-Bleaching

1. Eco-Friendly: Reduces harmful chemical waste and pollution.
2. Energy Efficient: Works at lower temperatures and pH _ levels.
3. Less Fabric Damage: In textiles, prevents fiber weakening compared to chemical
bleaching.

4. Improved Paper Quality: Gives brighter and stronger paper with reduced chemical
residue.

5. Safer for Workers: Lowers exposure to toxic chemicals in industries.

5. Challenges of Bio-Bleaching

1. Higher Initial — Costs: Enzyme production ~—can be —_ expensive.
2. Optimization Required: Needs specific conditions (pH, temperature) for efficiency.

3. Slower Process: Chemical bleaching is often faster, but bio-bleaching is more sustainable.
