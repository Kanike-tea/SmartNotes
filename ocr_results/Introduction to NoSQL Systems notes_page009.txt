« No Relationships: Cannot model relational or complex connections between data.

« Limited Querying Capability: No support for secondary indexes or complex queries
(unless added as a separate feature).

« Data Modeling Complexity: Developers must often handle logic in the application
layer, especially when working with complex data structures.

7. Summary

Key-Value stores are a powerful and efficient type of NoSQL database ideal for high-speed
data access, caching, session storage, and other use cases where relational structure is not
required. With minimal design complexity and maximum performance, they form a
foundational part of many modern, distributed applications. While they may not replace
relational or document stores in all scenarios, they are indispensable tools for specific,
performance-critical components of larger systems. Popular options like Redis and
DynamoDB continue to be widely adopted for their simplicity, scalability, and
responsiveness.

1. Introduction to Column-Based (Wide Column) NoSQL Databases

Column-based or wide-column NoSQL databases are designed to store data in columns
rather than rows, offering a more flexible and efficient model for handling large-scale,
distributed datasets. These systems organize data into tables, rows, and column families,
where each column family can contain any number of columns and rows. Unlike
traditional relational databases, rows in the same table can have different columns,
allowing for a schema-flexible design.

This type of NoSQL system is optimized for read and write performance at scale,
particularly in applications with high-volume workloads and time-series data. It’s widely
used for big data analytics, data warehousing, and real-time applications where
performance and scalability are critical.

2. Structure and Data Model
«Tables: Like in relational databases, but more flexible.
« Rows: Identified by a unique row key.

« Column Families: Group of columns stored together; all data within a family is
stored on disk contiguously.

e« Columns: Each column is stored with a name, value, and timestamp.
