DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

ARRAYS
e AnArray is defined as, an ordered set of similar data items. All the data items of an
array are stored in consecutive memory locations.
e The data items of an array are of same type and each data items can be accessed using
the same name but different index value.
e Anarray is a set of pairs, such that each index has a value associated with it. It can be
called as corresponding or a mapping
Ex: <index, value>
<0 ,25> list{0]=25
<1,15> list{1]=15
<2 ,20> list[2]=20
<3 ,17> list{3]=17
<4,35> list[4]=35

Here, list is the name of array. By using, list [0] to list [4] the data items in list can be accessed.

Structure Array is

objects: A set of pairs <index, value> where for each value of
index there is a value from the set item. Index is a finite
ordered set of one or more dimenSions, for example,
{0, .. , n-1} for onesdimension,
{(0,0), (0,1), (0,2) 4 (1,0), (171), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) } for
two dimensions, etc.

Functions:

for all, A e€Array,»i ¢index, x € item, j, size € integer

Array Create(j, list) .::= return an array of j dimensions where
list is a j-tuple whose ith element is
the size of the ith dimension. Items arel
undefined.

Item Retrieve(A, i) ::= aif (i eindex)

return the item associated with
index value i in array A
else
return error
Array Store(A, i, x) :1= if (i in index)
return an array that is identical
to array A except the new pair
<i, x> has been inserted
else
return error
end array
