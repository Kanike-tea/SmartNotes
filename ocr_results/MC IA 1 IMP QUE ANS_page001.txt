registers . In CISC design, data processing operations can act on memory directly, unlike the load-
store approach of RISC.

ARM-based Embedded System Hardware with Diagram

Figure 5.1 (though the figure itself is not provided here, its description is) shows a typical embedded
device based on an ARM core and illustrates four main hardware components connected by buses20

ARM Processor: Controls the embedded device. It includes the core (the execution engine) and
surrounding components that interface with a bus, such as memory management and caches21 .

Controllers: Coordinate with important functional blocks. Interrupt controllers and memory
controllers are common examples21 .

Peripherals: Provide all the input-output capability external to the chip, responsible for the device's
uniqueness. Examples range from simple serial communication devices to complex wireless
devices22 .... All ARM peripherals are memory mapped, with programming interfaces as a set of
memory-addressed registers24 .

Bus: Used for communication between different parts of the device22 . Embedded systems use on-
chip buses that are internal to the chip to interconnect peripherals with the ARM core25 . The AMBA
(Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) is widely adopted for this purpose26 .

AMBA Technology Diagram

The sources describe AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) as an on-chip bus
architecture widely used for ARM processors26 . It was introduced in 1996 to allow peripheral
designers to reuse the same design across multiple projects, providing a "plug-and-play" interface for
hardware developers27 ....

The first AMBA buses introduced were the ARM System Bus (ASB) and the ARM Peripheral Bus
(APB)27 . Later, the ARM High Performance Bus (AHB) was introduced27 .

APB is intended for slower peripherals29 .
