BINARY LOGIC

Definition of Binary Logic

> Binary logic consists of binary variables and a set of logical operations. The
variables are designated by letters of the alphabet, such as A, B, C, x, y, z, etc.,
with each variable having two distinct possible values: 1 and 0.

There are three basic logical operations: AND, OR, and NOT. Each operation produces
a binary result, denoted by z.

1. AND: This operation is represented by a dot or by the absence of an operator.
Example, x.y = z or xy = zis read “x AND y is equal to z.”

If z= 1 if and only if x = 1 and y = 1; otherwise z = O. The result of the operation x
wisz.

x, y, and z are binary variables and can be equal either to 1 or O

2. OR: This operation is represented by a plus sign. For example, x + y = z is read “x OR

y is equal to z,” meaning that z = 1 if x = 1 or if y = 1 or if both x = 1 and y = 1. If
both x = O and y = O, then z = 0.

3. NOT: This operation is represented by a prime (or by an overbar).
For example, x= z (or x = z) is read “not x is equal to z,”.

If x = 1, then z = O, and if x = O, then z = 1. The NOT operation is also referred to as
the complement operation, since it changes a 1 to O anda Oto 1.

Truth table

> A truth table is a table of all possible combinations of the variables, showing the
relation between the values that the variables may take and the result of the
operation.

> The truth tables for the operations AND and OR with variables x and y are
obtained by listing all possible values that the variables may have when
combined in pairs.
