DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 2

Analysis of padd:
To determine the computing time of padd, first determine which operations contribute to the
cost. For this algorithm, there are three cost measures:
(1) Coefficient additions
(2) Exponent comparisons

(3) Creation of new nodes for c

The maximum number of executions of any statement in padd is bounded above by m + n.
Therefore, the computing time is O(m+n). This means that if we implement and run the
algorithm on a computer, the time it takes will be Clm + C2n + C3, where Cl, C2, C3 are
constants. Since any algorithm that adds two polynomials must look at each nonzero term at

least once, padd is optimal to within a constant factor.

3. Erasing a Polynomial

Void erase (polyPointer *ptr)
{
polyPointer temp;
while (*ptr)
{
Temp=*ptr;
*ptr=(*pith) ->link;

Free (temp)

Program:erasing polynomial

4. Circular representation of polynomials
Circular linked list are one they of liner linked list. In which the link fields of last node of the
list contains the address of the first node of the list instead of contains a null pointer.
Advantages:- Circular list are frequency used instead of ordinary linked list because in circular
list all nodes contain a valid address.
The important feature of circular list is as follows.
(1) Ina circular list every node is accessible from a given node.

(2) Certain operations like concatenation and splitting becomes more efficient in circular list.
