Why are the concepts of extents and keys important in database applica-
tions?

Describe the following OQL concepts: database entry points, path expressions,
iterator variables, named queries (views), aggregate functions, grouping,
and quantifiers.

What is meant by the type orthogonality of OQL?

Discuss the general principles behind the C++ binding of the ODMG
standard.

What are the main differences between designing a relational database and
an object database?

Describe the steps of the algorithm for object database design by EER-to-
OO mapping.

Convert the example of GEOMETRY_OBJECTs given in Section 12.1.5 from
the functional notation to the notation given in Figure 12.2 that distin-
guishes between attributes and operations. Use the keyword INHERIT to
show that one class inherits from another class.

Compare inheritance in the EER model (see Chapter 4) to inheritance in the
OO model described in Section 12.1.5.

Consider the UNIVERSITY EER schema in Figure 4.10. Think of what opera-
tions are needed for the entity types/classes in the schema. Do not consider
constructor and destructor operations.

Consider the COMPANY ER schema in Figure 3.2. Think of what operations
are needed for the entity types/classes in the schema. Do not consider con-
structor and destructor operations.

Design an OO schema for a database application that you are interested in.
Construct an EER schema for the application, and then create the corre-
sponding classes in ODL. Specify a number of methods for each class, and
then specify queries in OQL for your database application.

Consider the AIRPORT database described in Exercise 4.21. Specify a num-
ber of operations/methods that you think should be applicable to that appli-
cation. Specify the ODL classes and methods for the database.

Map the COMPANY ER schema in Figure 3.2 into ODL classes. Include
appropriate methods for each class.

Specify in OQL the queries in the exercises of Chapters 6 and 7 that apply to
the COMPANY database.
