Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module 1

Analysis: Let n be length of the postfix string then the complexity of the function is O(n)

Scan P from Left to righ
Repeats steps 3 and 4 until we reach the end of P
If an operand is encountered put it on stack
If an operator ® is encountered then:
a) remove two top elements of STACK, where A is the top element and B is the next
top- element
b) Evaluate B @ A
c) Place the result of (4) in STACK.

[End of If structure]
[End of step 2 Loop]
5. Set VALUE equal to the top element of STACK.
6. EXit

Recursion: Recursion is the process of defining an object in terms of a simpler case of itself.

Factorial function: The factorial of a number n is got by finding the product of all the numberform
1 to n. ie 1*2*3...*n.. It is represented as n!

Example 4!=4*3*2* 1=24
5!=5*4*3*2*1=120
O!=1
From a close observation it can be observed that 5!= 5*4! . Therefore n!=n*(n-1)!
Accordingly the factorial function can be defined as
Factorial function definition

a) Ifn=0, then n!=1
b) If n>0, then n!=n*(n-1)!
