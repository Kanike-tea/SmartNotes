Data Structures and Applications (BCS304)

Module V

Example: Hash function that transforms keys into 6 bit non negative integers. H(k,t) denote the
integers formed by the ‘t’ least significant bits of h(k).
The example taken is a two letter key. H transforms Letter A,B,C into bit sequnce 100,101 and

110 respectively Digits 0 through 7 are transformed into their 3 bit representation

k | hk)
AO | 100 000
Al | 100001
BO | 101,000
B1 | 101 001
Cl | 110001
C2 | 110010
c3 | 110011
C5 | 110101

Example: Figure below shows a dynamic hash table that contain the keys AO, BO,A1,B1,C2 and C3.

Here the directory depth is 2 and uses buckets that have 2 slots. For each key k,

00
OL
10
ll

we examine the bucket pointed to by d[h(k,t)] where t is the

irectory depth. Suppose we insert C5

into the hash table since h(c5,2)=01 we follow the pointer d[01] and this bucket is full. To resolve
the overflow, we determine the least u such that h(k,u) is not the same for all keys. Incase u is
greater than the directory depth we increase the directory depth to this least value u. Figure below
