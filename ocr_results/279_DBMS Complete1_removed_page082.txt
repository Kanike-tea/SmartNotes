CLOSURE OF A SET OF FUNCTIONAL DEPEDENCIES

Given a relational schema R, a functional dependencies f on R is logically implied by a set of
functional dependencies F on R if every relation instance r(R) that satisfies F also satisfies f.

The closure of F, denoted by F*, is the set of all functional dependencies logically implied by F.
The closure of F can be found by using a collection of rules called Armstrong axioms.
Reflexivity rule: If A is a set of attributes and B is subset or equal to A, then AB holds.
Augmentation rule: IfA—B holds and C is a set of attributes, then CA—CB holds
Transitivity rule: If A-B holds and BC holds, then A>C holds.

Union rule: If A—B holds and AC then ABC holds

Decomposition rule: If A—BC holds, then AB holds and AC holds.

Pseudo transitivity rule: If AB holds and BC—D holds, then ACD holds.

Suppose we are given a relation schema R=(A,B,C,G,H,I) and the set of function dependencies
{A—B,A—>C,CG—H,CG—1,B—H}
We list several members of F* here:
1. AH, since AB and BH hold, we apply the transitivity rule.
2. CG—HI. Since CGH and CG-1 , the union rule implies that CG-HI
3. AGI, since AC and CGI, the pseudo transitivity rule implies that AG—I holds

Algorithm of compute F+ :
To compute the closure of a set of functional dependencies F:
F+=F
repeat
for each functional dependency f in F+
apply reflexivity and augmentation rules on f
add the resulting functional dependencies to F+
for each pair of functional dependencies fland f2 in F+
if f1 and f2 can be combined using transitivity
then add the resulting functional dependency to F+
until F+ does not change any further
