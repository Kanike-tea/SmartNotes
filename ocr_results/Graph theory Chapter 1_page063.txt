1, Directed Graphs and Gra,

In this graph:
(i) The sequence v) €1 V2 € v3 eg V6 is a walk of length 3 (because, this walk contains
edges: €1, €2, eg). In this walk, no vertex and no edge is repeated.

(ii). The sequence v; €4 Vs €3 V2 7 V3.5 Vs 6 V4 isa walk of length 5. In this walk, the v

vs is repeated, but no edge is repeated.
(iii) The sequence v 1 v2 €3 Vs €3 V2 €2 V3 is a walk of length 4. In this walk, the edge e
repeated and the vertex v2 is repeated.

The vertex with which a walk begins is called the initial vertex (or the origin) of the wal}
and the vertex with which a walk ends is called the final vertex (or the terminus) of the wa k
The initial vertex and the final vertex of a walk are together called its terminal vertices.
terminal vertices of a walk need not be distinct. Nonterminal vertices of a walk are called it
internal vertices.

A walk having u as the initial vertex and v as the final vertex is called a walk from u to v,
briefly a u-v walk. 4

A walk that begins and ends at the same vertex is called a closed walk. In other word
closed walk is a walk in which the terminal vertices are coincident.

A walk which is not closed is called an open walk. In other words, an open walk is a
that begins and ends at two different vertices.

For example, in the graph shown in Figure 1.98, vjeiv2e3vseav1 is a closed walk
v1e)¥2e2V3esVs5 is an open walk.

Trail and Circuit

‘As mentioned before, in a walk, vertices and/or edges may appear more than once. If in n
open walk no edge appears more than once, then the walk is called a trail. A closed walk i
which no edge appears more than once is called a circuit.
