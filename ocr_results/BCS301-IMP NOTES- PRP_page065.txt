Statistics: Any function of the sample values is known as a statistics.
Eg: Sample mean, Sample median, Sample variance etc. are all statistics.

Sampling Distribution: A sampling distribution is a distribution of a statistic over all possible
samples. That is sampling distribution is the probability distribution of the statistics.

Sampling Variables: Variables sampling is the process used to predict the value of a specific

variable within a population. For example, a limited sample size can be used to compute the average
accounts receivable balance, as well as a statistical derivation of the plus or minus range of the total
receivables value that is under review.

The Central Limit Theorem: Suppose that a sample of size n is selected from a population that

has mean yp and the standard deviation a, then Let x1, 2,3, X4....--- , Xn be the n observations, they

are independent and identically distributed with mean X = =-)L1%;, the central

limit theorem states that the sample mean X follows approximately the normal distribution with

mean wand standard deviation z (is also called Standard error) , i.e. X~N (u, <) , where pl , oare

mean and standard deviation of the population from where the sample was selected and the sample
size becomes large (n => 30).

Degrees of freedom: Degrees of freedom refer to the maximum number of logically independent
values, which may vary in a data sample. Degrees of freedom are calculated by subtracting one
from the number of items within the data sample (n -1).
