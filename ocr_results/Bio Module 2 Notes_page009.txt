« Efficacy: DNA vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing
rabies infection in both animal and human trials. In one study, a DNA vaccine
was found to be as effective as a traditional vaccine in protecting dogs against
rabies.

e Long-lasting protection: DNA vaccines can stimulate a strong and long-lasting
immune response, which means that they can provide protection against rabies
for extended periods of time.

e Ease of administration: DNA vaccines are easy to administer, as they can be
given via injection or even delivered orally, which can be particularly useful in
areas where access to medical facilities is limited.

* Cost-effective: DNA vaccines are relatively inexpensive to produce compared to
traditional vaccines, which can make them more accessible in areas where
resource are limited.

e Reduced risk of side effects: DNA vaccines do not contain live virus particles,
which means that they are generally safer and have a lower risk of side effects

compared to traditional vaccines.

RNA Vaccines

RNA vaccines are a type of vaccine that use genetic material from a pathogen, in the
form of RNA, to stimulate an immune response against the disease. The vaccine works by
introducing the pathogen's RNA into the body, where it is taken up by cells and used to produce
viral or bacterial proteins. These proteins are then displayed on the surface of the cells, which
triggers an immune response and the production of antibodies against the pathogen.

RNA vaccines have several advantages over traditional vaccines, including faster
production time and the ability to target multiple antigens. RNA vaccines can be manufactured
quickly, making them a good option for emergency situations where large numbers of people
need to be vaccinated quickly. RNA vaccines are also thought to be safer than traditional
vaccines, as they do not contain any live virus or bacteria that could cause disease. RNA
vaccines are currently being developed and tested for a range of diseases, including COVID

19, influenza, and cancer.

RNA Vaccines for Covid19
RNA vaccines for COVID 19 are a type of vaccine that use genetic material from the SARS-
CoV-2 virus, in the form of RNA, to stimulate an immune response against the virus. The
vaccine works by introducing the virus's RNA into the body, where it is taken up by cell and

used to produce viral proteins. These proteins are then displayed on the surface of the cells,
