Database Management System [BCS403]

= In addition, the log is periodically backed up to archival storage (tape) to guard against
such catastrophic failures
= The following are the types of entries—called log records—that are written to the log file
and the corresponding action for each log record.
= In these entries, T refers to a unique transaction-id that is generated automatically by
the system for each transaction and that is used to identify each transaction:
1. [start_transaction, T]. Indicates that transaction T has started execution.
2. [write_item, T, X, old_value, new_value]. Indicates that transaction T has changed
the value of database item X from old_value to new_value.
3. [read_item, T, X]. Indicates that transaction T has read the value of database item X.
4. [commit, T]. Indicates that transaction T has completed successfully, and affirms that
its effect can be committed (recorded permanently) to the database.
5. [abort, T]. Indicates that transaction T has been aborted.

5.3.3 Commit Point of a Transaction:
= Definition a Commit Point:

— A transaction T reaches its commit point when all its operations that access the
database have beenexecuted successfully and the effect of all the transaction
operations on the database has been recorded in the log.

— Beyond the commit point, the transaction is said to be committed, and its effect is
assumed to be permanently recorded in the database.

— The transaction then writes an entry [commit,T] into the log.

= Roll Back of transactions:
— Needed for transactions that have a [start_transaction,T] entry into the log but no
commit entry [commit,T] into the log.
5.3.4 DBMS specific buffer Replacement policies
Domain Separation(DS) method
+ DBMS cache is divided into separate domains, each handles one type of disk pages
and replacements within each domain are handled via basic LRU page replacement.
+ LRU is a static algorithm and does not adopts to dynamically changing loads because
the number of available buffers for each domain is predetermined.
+ Group LRU adds dynamically load balancing feature since it gives each domain a

priority and selects pages from lower priority level domain first for replacement.
