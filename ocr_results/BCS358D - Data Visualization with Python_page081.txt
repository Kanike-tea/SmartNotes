LAB PROGRAM 9
9) Write a Python program to draw 3D Plots using Plotly Libraries.
Aim: Demonstration of how to draw 3D plots using Plotly libraries.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

To draw 3D plots using the Plotly library in Python, you first need to install the Plotly library:

pip install plotly

Plotly is a powerful library for creating interactive and visually appealing 3D plots. This Python
program uses the Plotly library to create a 3D scatter plot based on data from a PUBG

(PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) dataset. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Import necessary libraries: The program imports the required modules:
plotly.graph_objects for creating the 3D scatter plot, plotly.offline for offline plotting,
and pandas for data manipulation.

2. Read and preprocess PUBG dataset: The code reads a PUBG dataset from a CSV file,
converts the data to numeric format, and creates a new DataFrame (df_new_pubg)
containing the first 10 rows of the dataset.

3. Select relevant data for the 3D scatter plot: The program selects specific columns
(‘solo_Wins', 'solo_TimeSurvived', and 'solo_RoundsPlayed') from the dataset to be used
as x, y, and z coordinates for the 3D scatter plot.

4. Create a 3D scatter plot trace: A Scatter3d trace is created with the specified x, y, and z
coordinates. The marker parameter is used to customize the appearance of the markers,
including their size, color based on the 'solo_RoundsPlayed' values, and opacity.

5. Create data and layout objects: The data for the plot is organized into a list (data), which
contains the tracel created earlier. The layout is defined with minimal margins to remove
unnecessary padding around the plot.

6. Create a Figure and plot it: A Plotly Figure is created using the data and layout objects.
The pyo.plot function is then used to generate an HTML file named '3d-pubg-plot.html'
and open it in a web browser. The 3D scatter plot should be interactive and viewable in

the browser.
