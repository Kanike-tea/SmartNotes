and the document properties, such as date of creation, author, and type of docu-
ment—are fetched from the inverted index and compared with the query. This
comparison results in a ranked list shown to the user. The user can then provide
feedback on the results that triggers implicit or explicit query modification and
expansion to fetch results that are more relevant for the user. Most IR systems allow
for an interactive search in which the query and the results are successively refined.

27.2 Retrieval Models

In this section, we briefly describe the important models of IR. These are the
three main statistical models—Boolean, vector space, and probabilistic—and the
semantic model.
