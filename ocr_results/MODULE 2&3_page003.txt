2.2 Barrel Shifter

In a MOV instruction N can be more than just a register or immediate value; it can also be a
register Rm that has been preprocessed by the barrel shifter prior to being used by a data

processing instruction.
Data processing instructions are processed within the arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

A unique and powerful feature of the ARM processor is the ability to shift the 32-bit binary
pattern in one of the source registers left or right by a specific number of positions before it
enters the ALU. This shift increases the power and flexibility of many data processing

operations.

There are data processing instructions that do not use the barrel shift, for example, the MUL

(multiply), CLZ (count leading zeros), and QADD (signed saturated 32-bit add) instructions.

Pre-processing or shift occurs within the cycle time of the instruction. This is particularly
useful for loading constants into a register and achieving fast multiplies or division by a

power of 2.

Fig 1: Barrel Shifter and ALU

Figure | shows a shift operation is added to the move instruction example. Register Rn enters
the ALU without any preprocessing of registers. Figure 1 shows the data flow between the

ALU and the barrel shifter.

Example: MOV 17,15, LSL #2 ; let r7 = 15*4 = (15 << 2) Before r5 is copied to 17, r5 is
shifted left by 2 bit position which is equal to multiply
by 4.
