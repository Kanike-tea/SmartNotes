time. With an operating system controlling these resources, they can be efficiently used by
different applications running within the operating system environment.
ARM processors support over 50 operating systems. The operating systems can be divide into
two main categories:

i) Real-time operating systems (RTOSs)

ii) Platform operating systems.
RTOSs provide guaranteed response times to events. Different operating systems have
different amounts of control over the system response time. A hard real-time application
requires a guaranteed response to work at all. In contrast, a soft real-time application requires
a good response time, but the performance degrades more gracefully if the response time
overruns. Systems running an RTOS generally do not have secondary storage.
Platform operating systems require a memory management unit to manage large, non real
time applications and tend to have secondary storage. The Linux operating system is a typical

example of a platform operating system.

5.3 Applications

The operating system schedules applications—code dedicated to handling a particular task.
An application implements a processing task; the operating system controls the environment.
An embedded system can have one active application or several applications running
simultaneously.

ARM processors are found in numerous market segments, including networking, automotive,
mobile and consumer devices, mass storage, and imaging. Within each segment ARM
processors can be found in multiple applications.

The mobile device segment is the largest application area for ARM processors because of
mobile phones. ARM processors are also found in mass storage devices such as hard drives
and imaging products such as inkjet printers—applications that are cost sensitive and high
volume.

In contrast, ARM processors are not found in applications that require leading-edge high

performance. Because these applications tend to be low volume and high cost.
