Applying this theorem to the line integrals in the RHS of (1) we obtain

As J f(z) dz = 0 by data, both the terms in the RHS must be zero.

equations and hence we can say that f(z) =u+iv
satisfy Cauchy-Riemann equations in R. Since we also have by data that the partial
derivatives are continuous, we conclude that f(z) is analytic in the region R.

Remark: This is the converse of Cauchy's theorem and is known as Morera’s theorem.

In other words if z.= a is outside C the value of the integral is zero.
