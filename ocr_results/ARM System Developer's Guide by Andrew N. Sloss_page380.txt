CHAPTER

FIRMWARE

This chapter discusses firmware for ARM-based embedded systems. Firmware is an impor-
tant part of any embedded system since it is frequently the first code to be ported and
executed on a new platform. Firmware can vary from being a complete software embedded
system to just a simple initialization and bootloader routine. We have divided this chapter
into two sections.

The first section introduces firmware. In this section we define the term firmware
and describe two popular industry standard firmware packages available for the ARM
processor—ARM Firmware Suite and Red Hat’s RedBoot. These firmware packages are
general purpose and can be ported to different ARM platforms relatively easily and quickly.

The second section focuses on just the initialization and bootloader process. To help
with this, we have developed a simple example called Sandstone. Sandstone is designed to
initialize hardware, load an image into memory, and relinquish control of the pe over to
that image.

We start by first discussing firmware and introduce the two common ARM firmware
packages.

10.1 FIRMWARE AND BOOTLOADER

We realize that the use of terms may differ among engineers, but we will use the following
definitions:

= The firmware is the deeply embedded, low-level software that provides an interface
between the hardware and the application/operating system level software. It resides
in the ROM and executes when power is applied to the embedded hardware
system. Firmware can remain active after system initialization and supports basic
