A System Crash A hardware, software or network error causes the transaction to fail.

‘Transaction or System |Some operation in the transaction may cause the failure or the user may

error interrupt the transaction.
Local Errors or Conditions occur during the transaction that results in transaction
Exceptions cancellation.

‘Concurrency Control —_|Several transactions may be in deadlock so the transaction may be aborted
Enforcement to be restarted later.

Disk Failure Read Write error on the physical disk.

Physical Problems ‘This can be any range of physical problems, such as power failure,
mounting wrong disk or tape by operator, wiring problems etc

Catastrophe Situations |Large scale threats to the system and the data for example fire, cyclone,
security breaches etc.

Transaction errors, system errors, system crashes, concurrency problems and local errors or
exceptions are the more common causes of system failure. The system must be able to recover
from such failures without loss of data.

Log-Based Recover y

COMMIT

Signals the successful end of a transaction

+ Any changes made by the transaction should be saved
* These changes are now visible to other transactions

ROLLBACK

Signals the unsuccessful end of a transaction

+ Any changes made by the transaction should be undone
+ It is now as if the transaction never existed

Log-Based Recovery

The most widely used structure for recording database modifications is the log. The log is a
sequence of log records and maintains a history of all update activities in the database. There are
several types of log records
An update log record describes a single database write:

e Transactions identifier.

e Data-item identifier.

e Old value.

e New value.

Other special log records exist to record significant events during transaction processing, such as
the start of a transaction and the commit or abort of a transaction. We denote the various types of
log records as:

¢ <Tistart>.Transaction Ti has started.

e <Ti, Xj, V1, V2> Transaction Ti has performed a write on data item Xj. Xj had value V1

before write, and will have value V2 after the write.
¢ <Ticommit> Transaction Ti has committed.
e <Tiabort> Transaction Ti has aborted.
