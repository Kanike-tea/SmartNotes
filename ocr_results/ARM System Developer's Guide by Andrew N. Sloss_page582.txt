APPENDIX

ARM AND THUMB
ASSEMBLER
INSTRUCTIONS

This appendix lists the ARM and Thumb instructions available up to, and including, ARM
architecture ARMv6, which was just released at the time of writing. We list the operations
in alphabetical order for easy reference. Sections A.4 and A.5 give quick reference guides to
the ARM and GNU assemblers armasm and gas.

We have designed this appendix for practical programming use, both for writing
assembly code and for interpreting disassembly output. It is not intended as a definitive
architectural ARM reference. In particular, we do not list the exhaustive details of each
instruction bitmap encoding and behavior. For this level of detail, see the ARM Architecture
Reference Manual, edited by David Seal, published by Addison Wesley. We do give a
summary of ARM and Thumb instruction set encodings in Appendix B.

A.l USING THIS APPENDIX

Each appendix entry begins by enumerating the available instructions formats for the given
instruction class. For example, the first entry for the instruction class ADD reads

1. ADD<cond>{S} Rd, Rn, #<rotated_immed> ARMV1

The fields <cond> and <rotated_immed> are two of a number of standard fields described
in Section A.2. Rd and Rn denote ARM registers. The instruction is only executed if the
