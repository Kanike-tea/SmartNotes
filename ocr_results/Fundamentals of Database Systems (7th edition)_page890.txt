Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts

3. Global Query Optimization. Optimization consists of selecting a strategy
from a list of candidates that is closest to optimal. A list of candidate queries
can be obtained by permuting the ordering of operations within a fragment
query generated by the previous stage. Time is the preferred unit for mea-
suring cost. The total cost is a weighted combination of costs such as CPU
cost, I/O costs, and communication costs. Since DDBs are connected by a
network, often the communication costs over the network are the most sig-
nificant. This is especially true when the sites are connected through a wide
area network (WAN).

4. Local Query Optimization. This stage is common to all sites in the DDB.
The techniques are similar to those used in centralized systems.

The first three stages discussed above are performed at a central control site,
whereas the last stage is performed locally.

23.5.2 Data Transfer Costs of Distributed Query Processing

We discussed the issues involved in processing and optimizing a query in a central-
ized DBMS in Chapter 19. In a distributed system, several additional factors further
complicate query processing. The first is the cost of transferring data over the net-
work. This data includes intermediate files that are transferred to other sites for
further processing, as well as the final result files that may have to be transferred to
the site where the query result is needed. Although these costs may not be very high
if the sites are connected via a high-performance local area network, they become
significant in other types of networks. Hence, DDBMS query optimization algo-
rithms consider the goal of reducing the amount of data transfer as an optimization
criterion in choosing a distributed query execution strategy.

We illustrate this with two simple sample queries. Suppose that the EMPLOYEE and
DEPARTMENT relations in Figure 3.5 are distributed at two sites as shown in Fig-
ure 23.4. We will assume in this example that neither relation is fragmented. Accord-
ing to Figure 23.4, the size of the EMPLOYEE relation is 100 * 10,000 = 10° bytes, and
the size of the DEPARTMENT relation is 35 + 100 = 3,500 bytes. Consider the query Q:
For each employee, retrieve the employee name and the name of the department for
which the employee works. This can be stated as follows in the relational algebra:

Q: TeFname,Lname,Dname(EMPLOYEE “pno=Dnumber DEPARTMENT)

The result of this query will include 10,000 records, assuming that every employee
is related to a department. Suppose that each record in the query result is 40 bytes
long. The query is submitted at a distinct site 3, which is called the result site
because the query result is needed there. Neither the EMPLOYEE nor the
DEPARTMENT relations reside at site 3. There are three simple strategies for execut-
ing this distributed query:

1. Transfer both the EMPLOYEE and the DEPARTMENT relations to the result
site, and perform the join at site 3. In this case, a total of 1,000,000 + 3,500 =
1,003,500 bytes must be transferred.
