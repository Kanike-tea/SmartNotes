flexibility, and performance. Such devices typically support RAID levels 0, 1, and 5.
Traditional storage area networks (SANs) differ from NAS in several ways. Specifi-
cally, SANs often utilize Fibre Channel rather than Ethernet, and a SAN often
incorporates multiple network devices or endpoints on a self-contained or private
LAN, whereas NAS relies on individual devices connected directly to the existing
public LAN. Whereas Windows, UNIX, and NetWare file servers each demand
specific protocol support on the client side, NAS systems claim greater operating
system independence of clients. In summary, NAS provides a file system interface
with support for networked files using protocols such as common internet file sys-
tem (CIFS) or network file system (NFS).

16.11.3 iSCSI and Other Network-Based Storage Protocols

A new protocol called iSCSI (Internet SCSI) has been proposed recently. It is a
block-storage protocol like SAN. It allows clients (called initiators) to send SCSI
commands to SCSI storage devices on remote channels. The main advantage of
iSCSI is that it does not require the special cabling needed by Fibre Channel and it
can run over longer distances using existing network infrastructure. By carrying
SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI facilitates data transfers over intranets
and manages storage over long distances. It can transfer data over local area net-
works (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet.

iSCSI works as follows. When a DBMS needs to access data, the operating system
generates the appropriate SCSI commands and data request, which then go through
encapsulation and, if necessary, encryption procedures. A packet header is added
before the resulting IP packets are transmitted over an Ethernet connection. When
a packet is received, it is decrypted (if it was encrypted before transmission) and
disassembled, separating the SCSI commands and request. The SCSI commands go
via the SCSI controller to the SCSI storage device. Because iSCSI is bidirectional,
the protocol can also be used to return data in response to the original request.
Cisco and IBM have marketed switches and routers based on this technology.

iSCSI storage has mainly impacted small- and medium-sized businesses because
of its combination of simplicity, low cost, and the functionality of iSCSI devices. It
allows them not to learn the ins and outs of Fibre Channel (FC) technology and
instead benefit from their familiarity with the IP protocol and Ethernet hardware.
iSCSI implementations in the data centers of very large enterprise businesses are
slow in development due to their prior investment in Fibre Channel-based SANs.

iSCSI is one of two main approaches to storage data transmission over IP networks.
The other method, Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP), translates Fibre Channel control
codes and data into IP packets for transmission between geographically distant
Fibre Channel storage area networks. This protocol, known also as Fibre Channel
tunneling or storage tunneling, can only be used in conjunction with Fibre Channel
technology, whereas iSCSI can run over existing Ethernet networks.

The latest idea to enter the enterprise IP storage race is Fibre Channel over
Ethernet (FCoE), which can be thought of as iSCSI without the IP. It uses many
