From the table of normal areas we find that 95% ‘ol the area lies between z= -1.%
and z = +1.96. In other words we can say with 95% confidence that z liesbetween
— 1.96 and + 1.96. Further 5% level of significance is denoted byZp, 05" anise wecan write

Thus we can write by combining the two results in the form, E

Similarly, from the table of normal areas 99% of the area lies between - air and
+ 2.58. This is equivalent to the form, ‘ :

Thus we can say that (2) is the 95% confidence interval and ai is the 99% confidence
interval.

The constants 1.96, 2.58 etc. in the confidence limits are smd confidence coefficients
denoted by z,. From confidence levels | we can find confidence coefficients and

vice-versa.

As reflected in the figure, we can say liens confidence that if the hypothesis is true,

the value of z for an actual sample lies between — 1.96’to 1.96 since the area under the -

normal curve between these values is 0.95, However if the value ofz-for random sample

lies outside this range we can conclude that the probability of the bahnpESNG of such :,

an event is only 0.05 if the given hypothesis is true.
