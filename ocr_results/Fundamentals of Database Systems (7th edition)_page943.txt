Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop

= Prescriptive analytics: Refers to analytics that recommends actions.

= Social media analytics: Refers to doing a sentiment analysis to assess public
opinion on topics or events. It also allows users to discover the behavior pat-
terns and tastes of individuals, which can help industry target goods and
services in a customized way.

= Entity analytics: This is a somewhat new area that groups data about enti-
ties of interest and learns more about them.

= Cognitive computing: Refers to an area of developing computing systems
that will interact with people to give them better insight and advice.

In another book, Bill Franks of Teradata’ voices a similar theme; he states that tap-
ping big data for better analytics is essential for a competitive advantage in any
industry today, and he shows how to develop a “big data advanced analytics ecosys-
tem” in any organization to uncover new opportunities in business.

As we can see from all these industry-based publications by experts, big data is
entering a new frontier in which big data will be harnessed to provide analytics-
oriented applications that will lead to increased productivity, higher quality, and
growth in all businesses. This chapter discusses the technology that has been created
over the last decade to harness big data. We focus on those technologies that can be
attributed to the MapReduce/Hadoop ecosystem, which covers most of the ground
of open source projects for big data applications. We will not be able to get into the
applications of the big data technology for analytics. That is a vast area by itself.
Some of the basic data mining concepts are mentioned in Chapter 28; however,
today’s analytics offerings go way beyond the basic concepts we have outlined there.

In Section 25.1, we introduce the essential features of big data. In Section 25.2, we
will give the historical background behind the MapReduce/Hadoop technology
and comment on the various releases of Hadoop. Section 25.3 discusses the
underlying file system called Hadoop Distributed File System for Hadoop. We
discuss its architecture, the I/O operations it supports, and its scalability. Sec-
tion 25.4 provides further details on MapReduce (MR), including its runtime
environment and high-level interfaces called Pig and Hive. We also show the
power of MapReduce in terms of the relational join implemented in various ways.
Section 25.5 is devoted to the later development called Hadoop v2 or MRv2 or
YARN, which separates resource management from job management. Its rationale
is explained first, and then its architecture and other frameworks being developed
on YARN are explained. In Section 25.6 we discuss some general issues related to
the MapReduce/Hadoop technology. First we discuss this technology vis-a-vis
the parallel DBMS technology. Then we discuss it in the context of cloud comput-
ing, and we mention the data locality issues for improving performance. YARN
as a data service platform is discussed next, followed by the challenges for big data
technology in general. We end this chapter in Section 25.7 by mentioning some
ongoing projects and summarizing the chapter.
