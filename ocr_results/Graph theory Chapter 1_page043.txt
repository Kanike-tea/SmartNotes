> (i) Since f: G > G" is an isomorphism, f is a wee. ne Correspondence (hang
is one-to-one and onto). Therefore, f is invertible, and f~ : G’ + Gis also g dite me

Further, since f is an isomorphism, for all vertices a, b in G, {a,b} is an edge in i :
only if (f(a), f(d)} is an edge in G’. Since a = f-'{f(a)} and b = SF), this is equi An
to saying that (f(a), f(b)) is an edge in G' if and only if {a,b} = (FMF@L FF) Pell
edge in G. .

It now follows that f-! : G’ — G is an isomorphism.

(ii) For any v € V, let k be its degree in G. Then there exist k distinct vertics v,, y.__ 4
such that {v,v;}, {v, v2}... {v, ve} are edges in G.

Consequently, {f(v), f(v1)), LF), F(v2)), -- LF), Fre) are edges in G’,

Since vj, v2,...Vg are distinct and f is a one-to-one correspondence, f(v1), f(v2),..., fly)
are also distinct and their number is k. Thus, there are k edges in G’ which are incident on fo),
Hence deg{f(v)} in G’ is k. This proves the required result. t
