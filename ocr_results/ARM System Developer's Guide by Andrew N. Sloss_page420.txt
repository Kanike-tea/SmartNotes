improvement to overall system performance. The principle of locality of reference explains
the performance improvement provided by the addition of a cache memory to a system.
This principle states that computer software programs frequently run small loops of code
that repeatedly operate on local sections of data memory.

The repeated use of the same code or data in memory, or those very near, is the reason
a cache improves performance. By loading the referenced code or data into faster memory
when first accessed, each subsequent access will be much faster. It is the repeated access to
the faster memory that improves performance.
