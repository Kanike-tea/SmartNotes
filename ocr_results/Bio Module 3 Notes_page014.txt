A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye that affects vision. The lens, located behind
the iris and pupil, normally allows light to pass through to the retina and produces clear, sharp
images. However, as we age or due to other factors, the proteins in the lens can clump together
and cause the lens to become opaque, leading to vision problems.

Symptoms of a cataract include blurred or hazy vision, increased sensitivity to glare and
bright lights, faded or yellowed colors, and double vision in one eye. Cataracts can also cause
frequent changes in prescription for eyeglasses or contacts.

Cataract surgery is a common and safe procedure to remove the cloudy lens and replace it
with an artificial lens. The surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis and most people
experience improved vision within a few days after the procedure.

In conclusion, cataracts can significantly affect vision, but surgical removal and
replacement with an artificial lens can restore clear vision and improve quality of life. Regular eye
exams can help detect cataracts early and prevent vision loss.

Lens Materials

The artificial lenses used in cataract surgery or for vision correction can be made of a variety of
materials, each with its own unique properties and benefits. The most common lens materials
include:

e Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA): PMMA is a type of plastic that has been used for
many years in artificial lenses. It is a durable and affordable material, but does not have the ability
to flex and adjust focus like the natural lens.

e Silicone: Silicone is a soft, flexible material that is resistant to cracking and breaking. It is
often used in phakic intraocular lenses (IOLs), which are implanted in front of the natural
lens.

e Acrylic: Acrylic is a lightweight, clear material that is similar in properties to PMMA. It is
often used in foldable IOLs, which can be inserted through a smaller incision.

e Hydrophobic acrylic: Hydrophobic acrylic is a type of acrylic material that has a special
surface treatment that helps to reduce glare and halos around lights.
