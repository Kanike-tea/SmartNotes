Introduction to SQL
Programming Techniques

n Chapters 6 and 7, we described several aspects of the

SQL language, which is the standard for relational
databases. We described the SQL statements for data definition, schema modifica-
tion, queries, views, and updates. We also described how various constraints on the
database contents, such as key and referential integrity constraints, are specified.

In this chapter and the next, we discuss some of the methods that have been devel-
oped for accessing databases from programs. Most database access in practical
applications is accomplished through software programs that implement database
applications. This software is usually developed in a general-purpose program-
ming language such as Java, C/C++/C#, COBOL (historically), or some other pro-
gramming language. In addition, many scripting languages, such as PHP, Python,
and JavaScript, are also being used for programming of database access within Web
applications. In this chapter, we focus on how databases can be accessed from the
traditional programming languages C/C++ and Java, whereas in the next chapter
we introduce how databases are accessed from scripting languages such as PHP.
Recall from Section 2.3.1 that when database statements are included in a program,
the general-purpose programming language is called the host language, whereas the
database language—SQL, in our case—is called the data sublanguage. In some
cases, special database programming languages are developed specifically for writ-
ing database applications. Although many of these were developed as research pro-
totypes, some notable database programming languages have widespread use, such
as Oracle’s PL/SQL (Programming Language/SQL).

It is important to note that database programming is a very broad topic. There are
whole textbooks devoted to each database programming technique and how that
technique is realized in a specific system. New techniques are developed all the
