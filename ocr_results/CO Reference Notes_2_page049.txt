© The main-memory can be built with DRAM (Figure 8.14)
© Thus, SRAM's are used in smaller units where speed is of essence.
© The Cache-memory is of 2 types:
1) Primary/Processor Cache (Levell or L1 cache)
> It is always located on the processor-chip.
2) Secondary Cache (Level2 or L2 cache)
> It is placed between the primary-cache and the rest of the memory.
¢ The memory is implemented using the dynamic components (SIMM, RIMM, DIMM).
© The access time for main-memory is about 10 times longer than the access time for L1 cache.

CACHE MEMORIES
The effectiveness of cache mechanism is based on the property of ,,Locality ofReference’.
Locality of Reference

* Many instructions in the localized areas of program are executed repeatedly during some time period
© Remainder of the program is accessed relatively infrequently (Figure 8.15).
© There are 2 types:
1) Temporal

> The recently executed instructions are likely to be executed again very soon.
2) Spatial

> Instructions in close proximity to recently executed instruction are also likely to be executed soon.
If active segment of program is placed in cache-memory, then total execution time can be reduced.
* Block refers to the set of contiguous address locations of some size.
© The cache-line is used to refer to the cache-block.
