database may be able to access parts of the database for which they lack authority. For
example, a high school student could get access to national defense secret codes, or
employees could find out what their supervisors earn.

Data could be lost permanently, rather than at least being available in a consistent state that
existed prior to a failure.

Consistency constraints may be violated when intgrity constraints failed in a transaction. For
example, incorrect bank balances might be reflected due to simultaneous withdrawals and
deposits, and so on.
