DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

General form of pointer declaration is —
type* name;
where type represent the type to which pointer thinks it is pointing to.

Pointers to machine defined _as well as user-defined types can_be made Pointer

Intialization:

variable _type *pointer_name = 0;
or variable_type *pointer_name = NULL;

char *pointer_name = "string value here";

DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION

This is process of allocating memory-space during execution-time (or run-time).

+ This is used if there is an unpredictable storage requirement.

* Memory-allocation is done on a heap.

* Memory management functions include:

— malloc (memory allocate)

— calloc (contiguous memory allocate)

— realloc (resize memory)

— free (deallocate memory)

* malloc function is used to,allocate required amount of memory-space during run-time.
+ If memory allocation succeeds, then address of first byte of allocated space is returned. If
memory allocation fails, then NULL is returned.

+ free() function is used to deallocate(or free) an area of memory previously allocated by

malloc() or calloc().

#include void main()
{
int i,*pi;
pi=(int*)malloc(sizeof (int) );
*pi=1024;
printf("an integer =%d",pi);

free(pi);
