28.6 Applications of Data Mining

Data mining technologies can be applied to a large variety of decision-making con-
texts in business. In particular, areas of significant payoffs are expected to include
the following:

= Marketing. Applications include analysis of consumer behavior based on
buying patterns; determination of marketing strategies, including adver-
tising, store location, and targeted mailing; segmentation of customers,
stores, or products; and design of catalogs, store layouts, and advertising
campaigns.

= Finance. Applications include analysis of creditworthiness of clients; seg-
mentation of account receivables; performance analysis of finance invest-
ments like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds; evaluation of financing options;
and fraud detection.

= Manufacturing. Applications involve optimization of resources like
machines, personnel, and materials; and optimal design of manufacturing
processes, shop-floor layouts, and product design, such as for automobiles
based on customer requirements.

= Healthcare. Applications include discovery of patterns in radiological
images, analysis of microarray (gene-chip) experimental data to cluster
genes and to relate to symptoms or diseases, analysis of side effects of drugs
and effectiveness of certain treatments, optimization of processes within a
hospital, and analysis of the relationship between patient wellness data and
doctor qualifications.

28.7 Commercial Data Mining Tools

Currently, commercial data mining tools use several common techniques to extract
knowledge. These include association rules, clustering, neural networks, sequenc-
ing, and statistical analysis. We discussed these earlier. Also used are decision trees,
which are a representation of the rules used in classification or clustering, and sta-
tistical analyses, which may include regression and many other techniques. Other
commercial products use advanced techniques such as genetic algorithms, case-
based reasoning, Bayesian networks, nonlinear regression, combinatorial optimiza-
tion, pattern matching, and fuzzy logic. In this chapter, we have already discussed
some of these.

Most data mining tools use the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) interface.
ODBC is an industry standard that works with databases; it enables access to data in
most of the popular database programs such as Access, dBASE, Informix, Oracle,
and SQL Server. Some of these software packages provide interfaces to specific
database programs; the most common are Oracle, Access, and SQL Server. Most of
the tools work in the Microsoft Windows environment and a few work in the UNIX
operating system. The trend is for all products to operate under the Microsoft
