ARRAY MULTIPLICATION
1) The main component in each cell is a full adder(FA)..
2) The AND gate in each cell determines whether a multiplicand bit mj, is added to the incoming
partial- product bit, based on the value of the multiplier bit qi (Figure9.6).

SEQUENTIAL CIRCUIT BINARY MULTIPLIER
Registers A and Q combined hold PPi(partial product)

while the multiplier bit qi generates the signal Add/Noadd.
¢ The carry-out from the adder is stored in flip-flop C (Figure 9.7).
¢ Procedure for multiplication:
1) Multiplier is loaded into register Q, Multiplicand is loaded into register M and
C & A are cleared to 0.
2) If qO=1, add M to A and store sum in A. Then C, A and Q are shifted right one bit-
position. If q0=0, no addition performed and C, A & Q are shifted right one bit-position.
3) After n cycles, the high-order half of the product is held in register A
and the low-order half is held in register Q.

Register A. (initially 0)
