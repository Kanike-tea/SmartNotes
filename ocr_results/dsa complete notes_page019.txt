e¢ When a matrix is represented as a two dimensional | array defined as a[max_rows][max_cols],
we can locate each element quickly by writing a[i][j] where i is the row index and j is the

column index.

¢ Consider the matrix given below. It contains many zero entries, such a matrix is called a sparse

matrix
Col0_ Coll
Row0|15 0
Rowl | 0 ll
Row2 | 0 0
Row3 | 0 0
Row4 | 91 0
Row5 |0 0

Col2 Col3 Col4 _Col5

0 22 0 -15
3 0 0 0
0 -6 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
28 0 0 0

When a sparse matrix is represented as a two dimensional array space is wasted for example if we
have 1000x 1000 matrix with only 2000 non zero element, the corresponding 2 dimensional array
requires space for 1,000,000 elements

ADT Sparse Matrix objects: a set of triples, <row, column, value>, where row and column are
integers and form a unique combination, and value comes from the set item.

Functions:
for all a, beSparseMatrix, x€item, i, j, maxCol, maxRoweindex

n

parse MatrixCreate(maxRow, maxCol) ::=

return a SparseMatrix that can hold up to

maxItems = maxRow x maxCol and whose maximum
row size is maxRow and whose maximum column size
is maxCol.

n

arse MatrixTranspose(a) : =

return the matrix produced by interchanging
the row and column value of every triple.

n

arse MatrixAdd(a, b) :=

if the dimensions of a and b are the same

return the matrix produced by adding corresponding
items, namely those with identical row and column
values else return error

n

arse MatrixMultiply(a, b) :=

if number of columns in a equals number of

rows in b return the matrix d produced by multiplying
a by b according to the formula:

d{iJ[j] = = (alil[k]-b[k][j]) else return error.

Sparse Matrix Representation

e A Sparse matrix can be represented by using an array of triple <row, col, value >.

e In addition to ensure the operations terminate , it is necessary to know the number of rows and
columns, and the number of nonzero elements in the matrix. Putting all this information
together a sparse matrix can be created as follows

SparseMatrix Create(maxRow, maxCol) ::=

#define MAX_TERMS 101 /* maximum number of terms +1*/

typedef struct {
int col;
int row;
int value;
} term;
term a[MAX_TERMS] ;
