ltis easy to check that forthe graph shown in Figure 4.36 the sets (e2, e3}, {e1, es, é} and
{es, e4, €6, €7} are also cut-sets., This illustrates the fact that a graph can have more than one
cut-set and that different cut-sets can have different numbers of edges in them. :

Vertex-Partition
- Since { cut-set splits a connected graph G into two disconnected parts, it (cut-set) auto-
pelly pattitions the vertices of G into two sets: one set going with one part of G and the
dter set with the other part.’ These two sets of vertices are’complements of each other and are
