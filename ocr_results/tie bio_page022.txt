As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker.
Age-related and other medical conditions cause proteins and fibers within the lenses
to break down and clump together, clouding the lenses.

As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser. A cataract scatters
and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image
from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts
generally develop in both eyes, but not always at the same rate. The cataract in one
eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between
eyes. Cataracts may be partial or complete, stationary or progressive, hard or soft.
Histologically, the main types of age-related cataracts are nuclear sclerosis, cortical,
and posterior subcapsular.

Nuclear sclerosis is the most common type of cataract, and involves the central or
‘nuclear’ part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or ‘sclerotic’, due to
condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens.
