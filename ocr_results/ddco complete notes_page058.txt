Storage elements that operate with signal levels (rather than signal
transitions) are referred to as latches ; those controlled by a clock
transition are flip-flops.Latches are said to be level sensitive devices;
flip-flops are edge-sensitive devices.The two types of storage elements
are related because latches are the basic circuits from which all flip-

flops are constructed.

SR Latch (Set-Reset Latch):

The SR latch has two inputs, S (Set) and R (Reset).It has two outputs,
Q and ~Q (complement of Q).

When S is asserted, Q is set to 1, and when R is asserted, Q is reset
to O.The SR latch is sensitive to the input conditions, and having both

S and R asserted simultaneously can lead to unpredictable behavior.
