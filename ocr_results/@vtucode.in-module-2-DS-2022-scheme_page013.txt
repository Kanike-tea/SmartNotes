LINKED LIST

DEFINITION
A linked list, or one-way list, is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where
the linear order is given by means of pointers. That is,each node is divided into two parts:
e The first part contains the information of the element, and
e The second part, called the link field or nextpointer field, contains the address of
the next node in the list.
A linked list is a dynamic data structure where each element (called a node) is made up of
two items - the data and a reference (or pointer) which points to the:next node. A linked list is
a collection of nodes where each node is connected to the next node through a pointer.

Fig: Linked list with 6 nodes

In the above figure each node is pictured with two parts.
> The left part represents the information part of the node, which may contain an entire
record of data items.
> The right part represents the link field of the node
> An arrow drawn from a node to the next node in the list.
> The pointer of the last node contains a special value, called the NULL.
A pointer variable called first which contains the address of the first node. A special case is the

list that has no nodes; such a list is called the null list or empty list and is denoted by the null

pointer in the variable first.
