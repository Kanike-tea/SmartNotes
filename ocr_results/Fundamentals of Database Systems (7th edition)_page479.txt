from a database will only use a subset of the attributes, entity types, and relation-
ships in the database. In this example, the subset of the database that is needed is
shown in Figure 13.9.

At least three possible document hierarchies can be extracted from the database
subset in Figure 13.9. First, we can choose COURSE as the root, as illustrated in
Figure 13.10. Here, each course entity has the set of its sections as subelements, and
each section has its students as subelements. We can see one consequence of mod-
eling the information in a hierarchical tree structure. If a student has taken multiple
sections, that student’s information will appear multiple times in the document—
once under each section. A possible simplified XML schema for this view is shown.
in Figure 13.11. The Grade database attribute in the S-S relationship is migrated to
the STUDENT element. This is because STUDENT becomes a child of SECTION in this
hierarchy, so each STUDENT element under a specific SECTION element can have a
