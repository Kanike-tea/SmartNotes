6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL

Query 14. Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between
$30,000 and $40,000.

Q14: SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE (Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 40000) AND Dno = 5;

The condition (Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 40000) in Q14 is equivalent to the con-
dition (Salary >= 30000) AND (Salary <= 40000)).

6.3.6 Ordering of Query Results

SQL allows the user to order the tuples in the result of a query by the values of one
or more of the attributes that appear in the query result, by using the ORDER BY
clause. This is illustrated by Query 15.

Query 15. Retrieve a list of employees and the projects they are working on,
ordered by department and, within each department, ordered alphabetically by
last name, then first name.

Q15: SELECT —_D.Dname, E.Lname, E.Fname, P.Pname
FROM DEPARTMENT AS D, EMPLOYEE AS E, WORKS_ON AS W,
PROJECT AS P
WHERE —_D.Dnumber = E.Dno AND E.Ssn = W.Essn AND W.Pno =
P.Pnumber
ORDER BY D.Dname, E.Lname, E.Fname;

The default order is in ascending order of values. We can specify the keyword DESC
if we want to see the result in a descending order of values. The keyword ASC can be
used to specify ascending order explicitly. For example, if we want descending
alphabetical order on Dname and ascending order on Lname, Fname, the ORDER BY
clause of Q15 can be written as

ORDER BY D.Dname DESC, E.Lname ASC, E.Fname ASC

6.3.7 Discussion and Summary of
Basic SQL Retrieval Queries

A simple retrieval query in SQL can consist of up to four clauses, but only the first
two—SELECT and FROM—are mandatory. The clauses are specified in the follow-

ing order, with the clauses between square brackets [ ... ] being optional:
SELECT <attribute list>
FROM <table list>
[ WHERE <condition> ]

[ORDERBY <attribute list> ];

The SELECT clause lists the attributes to be retrieved, and the FROM clause
specifies all relations (tables) needed in the simple query. The WHERE clause
identifies the conditions for selecting the tuples from these relations, including
