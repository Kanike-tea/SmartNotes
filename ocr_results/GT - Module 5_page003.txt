vs and v9 have to be assigned colours other than a and f; they can have the same colow
y. Thus, a minimum of three colours are required for a proper colouring of this graph.
Hence, the chromatic number of this graph is 3. -

vertices V2, V4, ¥7, Vg. ¥9 and vio can be assigned the same colour 6 (other than @). Thus,

two colours are sufficient (-one colour is not sufficient) for a proper colouring of the
