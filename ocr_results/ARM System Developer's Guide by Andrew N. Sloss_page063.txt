instructions.

3.1 DATA PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS

The data processing instructions manipulate data within registers. They are move instruc-
tions, arithmetic instructions, logical instructions, comparison instructions, and multiply
instructions. Most data processing instructions can process one of their operands using the
barrel shifter.

If you use the S suffix on a data processing instruction, then it updates the flags in the
cpsr. Move and logical operations update the carry flag C, negative flag N, and zero flag Z.
The carry flag is set from the result of the barrel shift as the last bit shifted out. The N flag
is set to bit 31 of the result. The Z flag is set if the result is zero.

3.1.1 MOVE INSTRUCTIONS

EXAMPLE

3.1

Move is the simplest ARM instruction. It copies N into a destination register Rd, where
Nis a register or immediate value. This instruction is useful for setting initial values and
transferring data between registers.

Syntax: <instruction>{<cond>}{S} Rd, N

| MOV Move a 32-bit value into a register Rd=N

| MVN move the NOT of the 32-bit value into a register Rd =~N

Table 3.3, to be presented in Section 3.1.2, gives a full description of the values allowed
for the second operand N for all data processing instructions. Usually it is a register Rm or
a constant preceded by #.

This example shows a simple move instruction. The MOV instruction takes the contents of
register r5 and copies them into register r7, in this case, taking the value 5, and overwriting
the value 8 in register r7.

PRE v5 = 5
7 =8
MOV or7, r5; let r7 = r5
POST r5 =
