15.1.3 Minimal Sets of Functional Dependencies

Just as we applied inference rules to expand on a set F of FDs to arrive at F', its closure,
itis possible to think in the opposite direction to see if we could shrink or reduce the set
F to its minimal form so that the minimal set is still equivalent to the original set F.
Informally, a minimal cover of a set of functional dependencies E is a set of functional
dependencies F that satisfies the property that every dependency in E is in the closure
F' of F. In addition, this property is lost ifany dependency from the set F is removed; F
must have no redundancies in it, and the dependencies in F are in a standard form.

We will use the concept of an extraneous attribute in a functional dependency for
defining the minimum cover.

Definition: An attribute in a functional dependency is considered an extraneous
attribute if we can remove it without changing the closure of the set of depen-
dencies. Formally, given F, the set of functional dependencies, and a functional
dependency X — A in F, attribute Y is extraneous in X if Y CX, and F logically
implies (F — (X > A) U { (X- Y) > A}).

We can formally define a set of functional dependencies F to be minimal if it satis-
fies the following conditions:

1. Every dependency in F has a single attribute for its right-hand side.

2. We cannot replace any dependency X — A in F with a dependency Y > A,
where Y is a proper subset of X, and still have a set of dependencies that is
equivalent to F.

3. We cannot remove any dependency from F and still have a set of dependen-
cies that is equivalent to F.

We can think of a minimal set of dependencies as being a set of dependencies in a
standard or canonical form and with no redundancies. Condition 1 just represents
every dependency in a canonical form with a single attribute on the right-hand side,
and it is a preparatory step before we can evaluate if conditions 2 and 3 are met.*
Conditions 2 and 3 ensure that there are no redundancies in the dependencies
either by having redundant attributes (referred to as extraneous attributes) on the
left-hand side of a dependency (Condition 2) or by having a dependency that can be
inferred from the remaining FDs in F (Condition 3).

Definition. A minimal cover of a set of functional dependencies E is a mini-
mal set of dependencies (in the standard canonical form? and without redun-
dancy) that is equivalent to E. We can always find at least one minimal cover F
for any set of dependencies E using Algorithm 15.2.

‘This is a standard form to simplify the conditions and algorithms that ensure no redundancy exists in F.
By using the inference rule IR4, we can convert a single dependency with multiple attributes on the
right-hand side into a set of dependencies with single attributes on the right-hand side.

Sit is possible to use the inference rule IR5 and combine the FDs with the same left-hand side into a
single FD in the minimum cover in a nonstandard form. The resulting set is still a minimum cover, as
illustrated in the example.
