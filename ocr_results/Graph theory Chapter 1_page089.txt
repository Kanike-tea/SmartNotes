Since a Hamilton path in a graph G meets every vertex of G, the length of a Hamilton path
(if any) in a connected graph of n vertices is n — 1. (Recall that a path with n vertices has n ~ |
edges).
Remarks: If a vertex v in a connected graph G has degree k > 0, then a Hamiltonian path in G
must contain atleast one edge incident on v and atmost two edges incident on v. A Hamiltonian
cycle in G will contain exactly two edges incident on v. In particular, both edges incident on
a vertex of degree two will be contained in every Hamiltonian cycle. There cannot be three or
more edges incident with one vertex in a Hamiltonian cycle.

The following theorem, known as Ore’s theorem, whose proof is beyond the scope of this
text, provides a sufficient condition for a simple graph to be a Hamiltonian graph.
Theorem 1 . If in a simple connected graph with n vertices (where n > 3) the sum of the
degrees of every pair of non-adjacent vertices is greater than or equal to n, then the graph is
Hamiltonian.

The following theorem known as, Dirac’s theorem is an immediate consequence of the
above theorem.

Theorem 2. /f in a simple connected graph with n vertices (where n 2 3) the degree of ever)
vertex is greater than or equal to n/2, then the graph is Hamiltonian.

Proof: If ina simple connected graph with n vertices, the degree of each vertex is greater that
or equal to n/2, then the sum of the degrees of every pair of adjacent or non-adjacent vertices
is greater than or equal to n. Therefore, the graph is Hamiltonian (by Theorem 1). ay
Prove that the complete graph K,, where n > 3, is a Hamilton graph.

> In K;, the degree of every vertex is n - 1. If n > 3, we have n — 2 > 0, or 2n - 2 > me
(n-1)>n/2.

Thus, in Kn, where n > 3, the degree of every vertex is greater than n/2. Hence Kyi
Hamilton graph, by Theorem 2. 4
