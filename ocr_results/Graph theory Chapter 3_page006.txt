vertices of degree 4, Find the number of pendant vertices in T. _

> Le N be the number of pendant vertices in 7, It is given that T has two vertices of degree
‘2, four vertices Of degree 3 and three vertices of degree 4. Therefore, ~~ res

~ Total number of vertices = N+24+4+3=N+9, and

~ Sum of the degrees of vertices = (N x 1) + (2 x 2) + (4X3) + (3x4) =N +28.

> Since T has N +9 vertices, it has N + 9-1 = N +8 edges.

Therefore, by handshaking property, we have N +28 = 2(N + 8) which gives N = 12.
TMs, the given tree has 12 pendant vertices. tr
