8.1 Unary Relational Operations: SELECT and PROJECT

Notice that if we remove the keyword DISTINCT from this SQL query, then dupli-
cates will not be eliminated. This option is not available in the formal relational
algebra, but the algebra can be extended to include this operation and allow rela-
tions to be multisets; we do not discuss these extensions here.

8.1.3 Sequences of Operations and the RENAME Operation

The relations shown in Figure 8.1 that depict operation results do not have any
names. In general, for most queries, we need to apply several relational algebra
operations one after the other. Either we can write the operations as a single
relational algebra expression by nesting the operations, or we can apply one operation
at a time and create intermediate result relations. In the latter case, we must give
names to the relations that hold the intermediate results. For example, to retrieve
the first name, last name, and salary of all employees who work in department
number 5, we must apply a SELECT and a PROJECT operation. We can write a sin-
gle relational algebra expression, also known as an in-line expression, as follows:

TeFname, Lname, Salary(GDno=5(EMPLOYEE))

Figure 8.2(a) shows the result of this in-line relational algebra expression. Alterna-
tively, we can explicitly show the sequence of operations, giving a name to each
intermediate relation, and using the assignment operation, denoted by < (left
arrow), as follows:

DEP5_EMPS < Opno-5(EMPLOYEE)
RESULT  TeFname, Lname, Salary(DEP5_EMPS)

It is sometimes simpler to break down a complex sequence of operations by specify-
ing intermediate result relations than to write a single relational algebra expression.
We can also use this technique to rename the attributes in the intermediate and
result relations. This can be useful in connection with more complex operations
such as UNION and JOIN, as we shall see. To rename the attributes in a relation, we
simply list the new attribute names in parentheses, as in the following example:

TEMP < Opno=5(EMPLOYEE)
R(First_name, Last_name, Salary) < TFname, Lname, Salary(TEMP)

These two operations are illustrated in Figure 8.2(b).

If no renaming is applied, the names of the attributes in the resulting relation of a
SELECT operation are the same as those in the original relation and in the same
order. For a PROJECT operation with no renaming, the resulting relation has the
same attribute names as those in the projection list and in the same order in which
they appear in the list.

We can also define a formal RENAME operation—which can rename either the rela-
tion name or the attribute names, or both—as a unary operator. The general
RENAME operation when applied to a relation R of degree n is denoted by any of the
following three forms:

Ps(et, 62,..,8n)(R) or Ps(R) or Piet, 62,..., Bn)(R)
