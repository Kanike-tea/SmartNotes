13.1 Structured, Semistructured, and Unstructured Data 427

for representing semistructured data, often based on using tree or graph data struc-
tures rather than the flat relational model structures.

A key difference between structured and semistructured data concerns how the
schema constructs (such as the names of attributes, relationships, and entity types)
are handled. In semistructured data, the schema information is mixed in with the
data values, since each data object can have different attributes that are not known
in advance. Hence, this type of data is sometimes referred to as self-describing
data. Many of the newer NOSQL systems adopt self-describing storage schemes
(see Chapter 24). Consider the following example. We want to collect a list of bib-
liographic references related to a certain research project. Some of these may be
books or technical reports, others may be research articles in journals or conference
proceedings, and still others may refer to complete journal issues or conference
proceedings. Clearly, each of these may have different attributes and different types
of information. Even for the same type of reference—say, conference articles—we
may have different information. For example, one article citation may be com-
plete, with full information about author names, title, proceedings, page numbers,
and so on, whereas another citation may not have all the information available.
New types of bibliographic sources may appear in the future—for instance, references
to Web pages or to conference tutorials—and these may have new attributes that
describe them.

One model for displaying semistructured data is a directed graph, as shown in
Figure 13.1. The information shown in Figure 13.1 corresponds to some of the
structured data shown in Figure 5.6. As we can see, this model somewhat resem-
bles the object model (see Section 12.1.3) in its ability to represent complex objects
and nested structures. In Figure 13.1, the labels or tags on the directed edges
represent the schema names: the names of attributes, object types (or entity types
