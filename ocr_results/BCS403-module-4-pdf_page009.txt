Database Management System [BCS403]

MULTIWAY JOIN
It is also possible to nest join specifications; that is, one of the tables in a join may itself be a joined
table. This allows the specification of the join of three or more tables as a single joined table, which
is called a multiway join.
Example: For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the controlling department
number, and the department manager's last name,address, and birth date.

SELECT Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate

FROM ((PROJECT JOIN DEPARTMENT ON Dnum=Dnumber)

JOIN EMPLOYEE ON Mgr_ssn=Ssn)

WHERE Plocation='Stafford’;

1.1.7 Aggregate Functions in SQL

Aggregate functions are used to summarize information from multiple tuples into a single-tuple
summary. A number of built-in aggregate functions exist: COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, and AVG. The
COUNT function returns the number of tuples or values as specified in a query. The functions SUM,
MAX, MIN, and AVG can be applied to a set or multiset of numeric values and return, respectively,
the sum, maximum value, minimum value, and average (mean) of those values. These functions
can be used in the SELECTclause or in a HAVING clause (which we introduce later). The functions
MAX and MIN can also be used with attributes that have nonnumeric domains if the domain values
have a total ordering among one another.

Examples
1. Find the sum of the salaries of all employees, the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the
average salary.

SELECT SUM (Salary), MAX (Salary), MIN (Salary), AVG (Salary)

FROM EMPLOYEE;

2. Find the sum of the salaries of all employees of the ‘Research’ department, as well as the
maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this department.

SELECT SUM (Salary), MAX (Salary), MIN (Salary), AVG (Salary)

FROM (EMPLOYEE JOIN DEPARTMENT ON Dno=Dnumber)

WHERE Dname='Research’;

3. Count the number of distinct salary values in the database.
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT Salary)
FROM EMPLOYEE;
