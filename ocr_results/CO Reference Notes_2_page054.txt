Eg:
Consider 4 blocks/set in set associative cache.
> 2 bit counter can be used for each block.
> When a ‘hit’ occurs, then block counter=0; The counter with values originally lower than the
referenced one are incremented by | & all others remain unchanged.
> When a ‘miss’ occurs & if the set is full, the blocks with the counter value 3 is removed, the

new block is put in its place & its counter is set to “O" and other block counters are incremented
by 1.

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATION
¢ Two key factors in the commercial success are 1) performance & 2) cost.
¢ In other words, the best possible performance at low cost.
¢ A common measure of success is called the Pricel Performance ratio.
¢ Performance depends on
— how fast the machine instructions are brought to the processor &
— how fast the machine instructions are executed.
¢ To achieve parallelism, interleaving is used.
¢ Parallelism means both the slow and fast units are accessed in the same manner.

INTERLEAVING
¢ The main-memory of a computer is structured as a collection of physically separate modules.
¢ Each module has its own
1) ABR (address buffer register) &
2) DBR (data buffer register).
¢ So, memory access operations may proceed in more than one module at the same time (Fig 5.25).
¢ Thus, the aggregate-rate of transmission of words to/from the main-memory can be increased.

= k bits -» <—— m bits ——» — mbits ——> = k bits»

| Module | Address in module | MM address Address in module Ka MM adress

Figure 5.25 Addressing multiple-module memory systems.

© The low-order k-bits of the memory-address select a module.

While the high-order m-bits name a location within the module.

In this way, consecutive addresses are located in successive modules.

© Thus, any component of the system can keep several modules busy at any one time T.
¢ This results in both

— faster access to a block of data and

— higher average utilization of the memory-system as a whole.
© To implement the interleaved-structure, there must be 2k modules;

Otherwise, there will be gaps of non-existent locations in the address-space.
