e Bronchi: The trachea branches into two main bronchi, one for each lung. The bronchi are
larger airways that continue to branch into smaller airways called bronchioles.

e Bronchioles: The bronchioles are smaller airways that eventually lead to the alveoli. They
are surrounded by tiny air sacs called alveoli, which are the sites of gas exchange.

e Alveoli: The alveoli are tiny air sacs that are lined with a network of capillaries. This
close proximity of the alveoli and capillaries allows for efficient diffusion of oxygen and
carbon dioxide between the air in the alveoli and the bloodstream.

Overall, the architecture of the lung is designed to provide a large surface area for gas
exchange, while filtering out harmful substances and humidifying the air. The close proximity of
the alveoli and capillaries, along with the moist lining of the respiratory tract, ensures that the air is
properly purified and the bloodstream is supplied with fresh, oxygen-rich air.

Gas Exchange Mechanism of Lung

The gas exchange mechanism in the lung involves the transfer of oxygen from the air in the
alveoli to the bloodstream, and the transfer of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the air in the
alveoli. This process is known as diffusion and occurs due to differences in partial pressures of
oxygen and carbon dioxide.

e Oxygen Diffusion: The partial pressure of oxygen in the air in the alveoli is higher than the
partial pressure of oxygen in the bloodstream. This difference creates a gradient that causes
oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin in red
blood cells to form oxyhemoglobin.

e Carbon Dioxide Diffusion: The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is
higher than the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air in the alveoli. This difference
creates a gradient that causes carbon dioxide to diffuse from the bloodstream into the alveoli,
where it is exhaled.

Spirometry

Spirometry is a diagnostic test that measures the function of the lungs by measuring the
amount and flow rate of air that can be exhaled. The test is commonly used to diagnose lung
conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung
disease.

Principle: The principle behind spirometry is to measure the volume of air that can be
exhaled from the lungs in a given time period. By measuring the volume of air exhaled, spirometry
can provide information about the functioning of the lungs and the ability of the lungs to move air
in and out.

Working: Spirometry is performed using a spirometer, a device that consists of a
mouthpiece, a flow sensor, and a volume sensor. The patient is asked to exhale as much air as
possible into the spirometer, and the spirometer measures the volume and flow rate of the
exhaled air. The volume of air exhaled is displayed on a graph called a flow-volume loop, which
provides information about the lung function.
