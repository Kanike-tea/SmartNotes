28.4 Clustering

Algorithm 28.4. k-Means Clustering Algorithm
Input: a database D, of m records, r), ..., 7, and a desired number of clusters k
Output: set of k clusters that minimizes the squared error criterion

Begin
randomly choose k records as the centroids for the k clusters;
repeat
assign each record, r;, to a cluster such that the distance between r;
and the cluster centroid (mean) is the smallest among the k clusters;
recalculate the centroid (mean) for each cluster based on the records
assigned to the cluster;
until no change;
End;

The algorithm begins by randomly choosing k records to represent the centroids
(means), mj, ..., my, of the clusters, C), ..., Cy. All the records are placed in a
given cluster based on the distance between the record and the cluster mean. If
the distance between m; and record rj is the smallest among all cluster means,
then record r; is placed in cluster C;. Once all records have been initially placed in
a cluster, the mean for each cluster is recomputed. Then the process repeats, by
examining each record again and placing it in the cluster whose mean is closest.
Several iterations may be needed, but the algorithm will converge, although it
may terminate at a local optimum. The terminating condition is usually the
squared-error criterion. For clusters Cj, ..., C, with means mj, ..., mj, the error is
defined as:

k
Error= XY Dy Distance(r; Mm; y

We will examine how Algorithm 28.4 works with the (two-dimensional) records in
Figure 28.8. Assume that the number of desired clusters k is 2. Let the algorithm
choose records with RID 3 for cluster C, and RID 6 for cluster C3 as the initial cluster
centroids. The remaining records will be assigned to one of those clusters during
the first iteration of the repeat loop. The record with RID 1 has a distance from C, of
22.4 and a distance from C of 32.0, so it joins cluster C;. The record with RID 2 has
