In a rooted tree a vertex whose out-degree is 0 is called a leaf and a vertex whic!
leaf is called an internal vertex. Tite oe

For example, suppose we redraw the directed tree of Figure 3.6 as sheen below

With
arrows (- which are understood) and with vertices labeled. om

Figure 3.7

In this rooted tree, we note that

(1) v and v2 are at the first level, v3:vg are at the second level, vs, V6, v7,are at the third level;
and vg and vo are at the fourth level:

s +?

(2) v, is the ancestor of v3, vs, V6 (0T-V3, Vs, V6 are the descendants of v;), and v2 is the ancestor

of v4, V7, Vg, Vo (OF V4, V7, Vg, Vo are the descendants of v3). ' “
(3) vy is the parent of v3 (or v3 is a child of v1). fe Lo
(4) vs and v¢ are siblings, and vg and vg are siblings. oan :

(5). vs, V6, Vg, V9 are leaves; and all other vertices are internal vertices.
