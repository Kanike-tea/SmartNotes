To represent an E-R relationship of degree 3 or higher, connect the participating record types
through a new record type that is linked directly to each of the original record types.

1. Replace entity sets account, customer, and branch with record types account, customer, and
branch, respectively.
2. Create a new record type Rlink (referred to as a dummy record type).
3. Create the following many-to-one links:
o CustRlink from Rlink record type to customer record type
o AcctRink from Rlink record type to account record type
o BrncRInk from Rlink record type to branch record type
