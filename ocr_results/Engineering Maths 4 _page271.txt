Suppose we draw a tangent at the point of intersection of these two curves inthe . ©
w—plane (At P as in the figure) the angle subtended is equal to 90°. Hence these two - 7
curves can be regarded as orthogonal trajectories of each other. fo

Question-1 Show that the transformation w = e* map straight lines parallel to the’
co-ordinate axes in'the z— plane onto orthogonal trajectories in the w —plane and sketch.the

region.
>> Discussion of w = & as done already. -

Question-2 Discuss the transformation w =.e* with respect'to the lines represented as
co-ordinate axes in the z—plane. . . 2 or:

>> The co-ordinate axes in the z— plane are represented by x = 0,.y = 0.

We have obtained 1247? = 2% a; ; stiacaral(2)

When y = 0 (3) becomes v/u = tan0 = 0 orv=0 .
. the x-axis (real axis) in the z—plane is mapped onto the axis (real axis) in
the w—plane. : A

When x = 0, (2) becomes 240? = 1: .

. the y axis inthe z plane is mapped’ onto a unit circle with centre origin in
the w- plane. ee ;

Putting z = ré® we have

We shall eliminate r and @ separately from (1). ad ;
To eliminate @ let us put (1) in the form
