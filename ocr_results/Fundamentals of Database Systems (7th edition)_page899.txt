23.7 Distributed Database Architectures

formance computing, where there is a need for multiprocessor architectures to cope
with the volume of data undergoing transaction processing and warehousing
applications. We then introduce a generic architecture of a distributed database.
This is followed by discussions on the architecture of three-tier client/server and
federated database systems.

23.7.1 Parallel versus Distributed Architectures

There are two main types of multiprocessor system architectures that are com-
monplace:

= Shared memory (tightly coupled) architecture. Multiple processors share
secondary (disk) storage and also share primary memory.

= Shared disk (loosely coupled) architecture. Multiple processors share sec-
ondary (disk) storage but each has their own primary memory.

These architectures enable processors to communicate without the overhead of
exchanging messages over a network.* Database management systems developed
using the above types of architectures are termed parallel database management
systems rather than DDBMSs, since they utilize parallel processor technology.
Another type of multiprocessor architecture is called shared-nothing architecture.
In this architecture, every processor has its own primary and secondary (disk)
memory, no common memory exists, and the processors communicate over a high-
speed interconnection network (bus or switch). Although the shared-nothing
architecture resembles a distributed database computing environment, major dif-
ferences exist in the mode of operation. In shared-nothing multiprocessor systems,
there is symmetry and homogeneity of nodes; this is not true of the distributed
database environment, where heterogeneity of hardware and operating system at
each node is very common. Shared-nothing architecture is also considered as an
environment for parallel databases. Figure 23.7(a) illustrates a parallel database
(shared nothing), whereas Figure 23.7(b) illustrates a centralized database with dis-
tributed access and Figure 23.7(c) shows a pure distributed database. We will not
expand on parallel architectures and related data management issues here.

23.7.2 General Architecture of Pure Distributed Databases

In this section, we discuss both the logical and component architectural models of a
DDB. In Figure 23.8, which describes the generic schema architecture of a DDB, the
enterprise is presented with a consistent, unified view showing the logical structure
of underlying data across all nodes. This view is represented by the global concep-
tual schema (GCS), which provides network transparency (see Section 23.1.2). To
accommodate potential heterogeneity in the DDB, each node is shown as having its
own local internal schema (LIS) based on physical organization details at that

4if both primary and secondary memories are shared, the architecture is also known as shared- every-
thing architecture.
