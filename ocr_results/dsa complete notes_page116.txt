e For an undirected graph with n vertices and e edges. The linked adjacency lists representation

requires an array of size n and 2e chain nodes.

e The degree of any vertex in an undirected graph may be determined by counting the number
of nodes in the adjacency list.

e Fora digraph the number of list nodes is only e.

Adjacency Multi lists: For each edge there will be exactly one node, but this node will be in two
list(i.e., the adjacency list for each of the two nodes to which it is incident). A new field is necessary
to determine if the edge is determined and mark it as examined.

The new node structure is

m | Vertex! | Vertex2 | Link1 | Link2

Example: The adjacency multilist for graph G1 is shown below

adjLists NO 0} 1} NI} N3]  edge(O,1)

01 ee
Ni [ ]0[2[N2[N3] edge(o.2)
i] | es

|
N2 0|3/0|N4 edge(0,3)
[2] — |
N3 1|2|N4]|N5]_ edge(1,2)
[3]
L N4 1/3/0]N5 edge(1,3)
N5 2|3|0/0] edge(2,3)

The Lists are Vertex 0: NO->N1->N2
Vertex 1: NO->N3->N4
Vertex 2: N1->N3->N5
Vertex 3: N2->N4->N5

Weighted Edges: In many applications the edges of a graph have weight assigned to them. These
weights may represent the distance from one vertex t o another or the cost for going from one vertex
to an adjacent vertex. The adjacency matrix and list maintains the weight information also. A graph
with weighted edges are also called network.
