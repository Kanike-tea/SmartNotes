DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 2

Functions push and pop add and delete items to/from a stack.

void push(int i, element item)
{/* add item to the ith stack */
stackPointer temp;
MALLOC (temp, sizeof (*temp));
temp-data = item;
tempslink = top[i];
top[i] = temp;

Add to a linked stack

Function push creates a new node, temp, and places item in the data field and top in the link field. The
variable top is then changed to point to temp. A typical function call to add an element to the ith stack would

be push (i,item).

element pop(int i)
{ /* remove top element from the ith stack */

stackPointer temp = top[il;
element item;
if (! temp)
return stackEmpty ();

item = temp—data;
top[i] = temp—links
free (temp) }%

return item;

Delete from a linked stack

Function pop returns the top element and changes top to point to the address contained in

its link field. The removed node is then returned to system memory. A typical function

call to delete an element from the ith stack would be item = pop (i);
