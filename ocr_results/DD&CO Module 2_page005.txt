Four-bit Adder

The augend bits of A and the addend bits of B are designated by subscript numbers from right to left,
with subscript 0 denoting the least significant bit. The carries are connected in a chain through the full
adders. The input carry to the adder is Co, and it ripples through the full adders to the output carry C4.
The S outputs generate the required sum bits. An n -bit adder requires n full adders, with each output
carry connected to the input carry of the next higher order full adder. To demonstrate with a specific
example, consider the two binary numbers A = 1011 and B = 0011. Their sum S = 1110 is formed with
the four-bit adder as follows:

Subscript i: 3 2 1 0

Input carry 0 1 1 0 G

Augend 1 0 1 1 A;

Addend 0 0 1 1 B;

Sum 1 1 1 0 Si

Output carry 0 0 1 1 Cit

The bits are added with full adders, starting from the least significant position (subscript 0), to form the
sum bit and carry bit. The input carry Co in the least significant position must be 0. The value of C+: in
a given significant position is the output carry of the full adder. This value is transferred into the input
carry of the full adder that adds the bits one higher significant position to the left. The sum bits are thus
generated starting from the rightmost position and are available as soon as the corresponding previous
carry bit is generated. All the carries must be generated for the correct sum bits to appear at the outputs.

The four-bit adder is a typical example of a standard component. It can be used in many applications
involving arithmetic operations. Observe that the design of this circuit by the classical method would
require a truth table with 2° = 512 entries, since there are nine inputs to the circuit. By using an iterative
method of cascading a standard function, it is possible to obtain a simple and straightforward
implementation.

Carry Propagation

The addition of two binary numbers in parallel implies that all the bits of the augend and addend are
available for computation at the same time. As in any combinational circuit, the signal must propagate
through the gates before the correct output sum is available in the output terminals. The total propagation
time is equal to the propagation delay of a typical gate, times the number of gate levels in the circuit.
The longest propagation delay time in an adder is the time it takes the carry to propagate through the full
adders. Since each bit of the sum output depends on the value of the input carry, the value of Sj at any
given stage in the adder will be in its steady-state final value only after the input carry to that stage has
been propagated. In this regard, consider output S3 in Four-Bit Adder (above Fig). Inputs A3 and B3 are
available as soon as input signals are applied to the adder. However, input carry C3 does not settle to its
