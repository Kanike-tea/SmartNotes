combined with every female employee). We want to combine a female employee
tuple only with her particular dependents—namely, the DEPENDENT tuples whose
Essn value match the Ssn value of the EMPLOYEE tuple. The ACTUAL_DEPENDENTS
relation accomplishes this. The EMP_DEPENDENTS relation is a good example of
the case where relational algebra can be correctly applied to yield results that make
no sense at all. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure to apply only mean-
ingful operations to relations.

The CARTESIAN PRODUCT creates tuples with the combined attributes of two rela-
tions. We can SELECT related tuples only from the two relations by specifying an
appropriate selection condition after the Cartesian product, as we did in the pre-
ceding example. Because this sequence of CARTESIAN PRODUCT followed by
SELECT is quite commonly used to combine related tuples from two relations, a
special operation, called JOIN, was created to specify this sequence as a single opera-
tion. We discuss the JOIN operation next.

In SQL, CARTESIAN PRODUCT can be realized by using the CROSS JOIN option in
joined tables (see Section 7.1.6). Alternatively, if there are two tables in the FROM
clause and there is no corresponding join condition in the WHERE clause of the
SQL query, the result will also be the CARTESIAN PRODUCT of the two tables (see
Q10 in Section 6.3.3).

8.3.1 The JOIN Operation

The JOIN operation, denoted by ™, is used to combine related tuples from two rela-
tions into single “longer” tuples. This operation is very important for any relational
database with more than a single relation because it allows us to process relation-
ships among relations. To illustrate JOIN, suppose that we want to retrieve the name
of the manager of each department. To get the manager’s name, we need to com-
bine each department tuple with the employee tuple whose Ssn value matches the
Mgr_ssn value in the department tuple. We do this by using the JOIN operation and
then projecting the result over the necessary attributes, as follows:

DEPT_MGR < DEPARTMENT ™ jy gsn—Ssn EMPLOYEE
RESULT < Tpname, Lname, Fname( DEPT_MGR)

The first operation is illustrated in Figure 8.6. Note that Mgr_ssn is a foreign key of
the DEPARTMENT relation that references Ssn, the primary key of the EMPLOYEE
relation. This referential integrity constraint plays a role in having matching tuples
in the referenced relation EMPLOYEE.

The JOIN operation can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT operation fol-
lowed by a SELECT operation. However, JOIN is very important because it is
used frequently when specifying database queries. Consider the earlier example
