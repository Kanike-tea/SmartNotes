Importance of DNA vaccine for rabies DNA vaccines offer several advantages over traditional

vaccines, including their ability to stimulate a strong and long-lasting immune response with fewer

doses required, as well as their ease of manufacture and storage. These advantages make DNA

vaccines particularly useful for preventing the spread of infectious diseases like rabies.

RNA Vaccines for Covid19

RNA vaccines for COVID 19 are a type of vaccine that use genetic material from the SARS-CoV-

2 virus, in the form of RNA, to stimulate an immune response against the virus. The vaccine works

by introducing the virus's RNA into the body, where it is taken up by cell and used to produce viral

proteins. These proteins are then displayed on the surface of the cells, which triggers an immune

response and the production of antibodies against the virus.

The first RNA vaccine for COVID 19, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, was authorized for
emergency use in December 2020 and has been administered to millions of people worldwide.
Another RNA vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, was also authorized for emergency use in

December 2020.
