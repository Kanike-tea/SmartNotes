Introduction
e Data is a value or a set of values.
Example 90, Bob
e A data item refers to a single unit of values. Data items that are divided into sub items are
called group items.
Example :Name of an employee can be divided to three subitems- first name, middle
name and last name
e Data items that are not divided into sub items are called elementary items.

Data Structures: A data structure is a particular method of storing and organizing data
in acomputer so that it can be used efficiently. The data Structure is classified into

a. Primitive data structure: These can be manipulated directly by the machine instructions.
Example integer character, float etc

b. Non primitive data structures: They cannot be manipulated directly by the machine
instructions. The non primitive data structures are further classified into linear and non linear
data structures.

e Linear data structures: show the relationship of adjacency between the elements of
the data structures. Example are arrays, stacks, queues , list etc.

e Non linear data structure: They do not show the relationship of adjacency between
the elements. Example are Trees and graphs

Operations on data structures

Create: Creating a new data structure

Insert: Adding a new record to the structure.

Delete: Removing the record from the structure.

Search: Finding the location of a particular record with a given key value, or finding the
location of all records which satisfy one or more conditions.

Sort: Managing the data or record in some logical order (Ascending or descending order).
Merge: Combining the record in two different sorted files into a single sorted file.

7. Traversal: Accessing each record exactly once so that certain items in the record may be
processed.

Review of arrays
e Array is a collection of elements of the same data type
e Anarray is declared by appending brackets to the name of a variable.
