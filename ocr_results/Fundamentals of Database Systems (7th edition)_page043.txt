file—can be hidden from database users by the DBMS; we discuss storage details in
Chapters 16 and 17.

In the database approach, the detailed structure and organization of each file are
stored in the catalog. Database users and application programs refer to the concep-
tual representation of the files, and the DBMS extracts the details of file storage
from the catalog when these are needed by the DBMS file access modules. Many
data models can be used to provide this data abstraction to database users. A major
part of this text is devoted to presenting various data models and the concepts they
use to abstract the representation of data.

In object-oriented and object-relational databases, the abstraction process includes
not only the data structure but also the operations on the data. These operations
provide an abstraction of miniworld activities commonly understood by the users.
For example, an operation CALCULATE_GPA can be applied to a STUDENT object
to calculate the grade point average. Such operations can be invoked by the user
queries or application programs without having to know the details of how the
operations are implemented.

1.3.3 Support of Multiple Views of the Data

A database typically has many types of users, each of whom may require a different
perspective or view of the database. A view may be a subset of the database or it may
contain virtual data that is derived from the database files but is not explicitly stored.
Some users may not need to be aware of whether the data they refer to is stored or
derived. A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications must
provide facilities for defining multiple views. For example, one user of the database
of Figure 1.2 may be interested only in accessing and printing the transcript of each
student; the view for this user is shown in Figure 1.5(a). A second user, who is inter-
ested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites of each course
for which the student registers, may require the view shown in Figure 1.5(b).

1.3.4 Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing

A multiuser DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access the
database at the same time. This is essential if data for multiple applications is to be
integrated and maintained ina single database. The DBMS must include concurrency
control software to ensure that several users trying to update the same data
