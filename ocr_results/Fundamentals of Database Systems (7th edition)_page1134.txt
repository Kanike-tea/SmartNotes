1104 Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP

data warehousing more generally as a collection of decision-support technologies
aimed at enabling the knowledge worker (executive, manager, analyst) to make better
and faster decisions.’ Figure 29.1 gives an overview of the conceptual structure of a
data warehouse. It shows the entire data warehousing process, which includes pos-
sible cleaning and reformatting of data before loading it into the warehouse. This
process is handled by tools known as ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading)
tools. At the back end of the process, OLAP, data mining, and DSS may generate
new relevant information such as rules (or additional meta-data); this information is
shown in Figure 29.1 as going back as additional data inputs into the warehouse. The
figure also shows that data sources may include files.

The important characteristics of data warehouses that accompanied the defini-
tion of the term OLAP in 1993 included the following, and they are applicable
even today:>

Multidimensional conceptual view

Unlimited dimensions and aggregation levels

Unrestricted cross-dimensional operations

Dynamic sparse matrix handling

Client/server architecture

Multiuser support

Accessibility

Transparency

Intuitive data manipulation

Inductive and deductive analysis

Flexible distributed reporting

Because they encompass large volumes of data, data warehouses are generally an
order of magnitude (sometimes two orders of magnitude) larger than the source
databases. The sheer volume of data (likely to be in terabytes or even petabytes) is
an issue that has been dealt with through enterprise-wide data warehouses, virtual
data warehouses, logical data warehouses, and data marts:

= Enterprise-wide data warehouses are huge projects requiring massive
investment of time and resources.

= Virtual data warehouses provide views of operational databases that are
materialized for efficient access.

= Logical data warehouses use data federation, distribution, and virtualiza-
tion techniques.

= Data marts generally are targeted to a subset of the organization, such as a
department, and are more tightly focused.

Chaudhuri and Dayal (1997) provide an excellent tutorial on the topic, with this as a starting definition.

Codd and Salley (1993) coined the term OLAP and mentioned the characteristics listed here.
