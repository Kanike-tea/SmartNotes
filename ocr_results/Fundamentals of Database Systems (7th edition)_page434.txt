However, the class GRADE requires some explanation. The GRADE class corre-
sponds to the M:N relationship between STUDENT and SECTION in Figure 12.9(b).
The reason it was made into a separate class (rather than as a pair of inverse rela-
tionships) is because it includes the relationship attribute Grade.”

Hence, the M:N relationship is mapped to the class GRADE, and a pair of 1:N rela-
tionships, one between STUDENT and GRADE and the other between SECTION and

32We will discuss alternative mappings for attributes of relationships in Section 12.4.
