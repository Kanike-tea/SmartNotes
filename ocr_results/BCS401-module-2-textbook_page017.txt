FIGURE 5.1 Divide-and-conquer technique (typical case)

small example of summing, say, four numbers by this algorithm, a formal analysis
(which follows), and common sense (we do not normally compute sums this way,
do we?) all lead to a negative answer to this question.!

Thus, not every divide-and-conquer algorithm is necessarily more efficient
than even a brute-force solution. But often our prayers to the Goddess of
Algorithmics—see the chapter’s epigraph—are answered, and the time spent on
executing the divide-and-conquer plan turns out to be significantly smaller than
solving a problem by a different method. In fact, the divide-and-conquer approach
yields some of the most important and efficient algorithms in computer science.
We discuss a few classic examples of such algorithms in this chapter. Though we
consider only sequential algorithms here, it is worth keeping in mind that the
divide-and-conquer technique is ideally suited for parallel computations, in which
each subproblem can be solved simultaneously by its own processor.
