return one result to the query (that is, one set of values for the variables in the
query) at a time and must be prompted to return additional results. On the con-
trary, Datalog returns results set-at-a-time.

26.5.5 Interpretations of Rules

There are two main alternatives for interpreting the theoretical meaning of rules:
proof-theoretic and model-theoretic. In practical systems, the inference mechanism
within a system defines the exact interpretation, which may not coincide with either
of the two theoretical interpretations. The inference mechanism is a computational
procedure and hence provides a computational interpretation of the meaning of
rules. In this section, first we discuss the two theoretical interpretations. Then we
briefly discuss inference mechanisms as a way of defining the meaning of rules.

In the proof-theoretic interpretation of rules, we consider the facts and rules to be
true statements, or axioms. Ground axioms contain no variables. The facts are
ground axioms that are given to be true. Rules are called deductive axioms, since
they can be used to deduce new facts. The deductive axioms can be used to construct
proofs that derive new facts from existing facts. For example, Figure 26.12 shows
how to prove the fact SUPERIOR(james, ahmad) from the rules and facts given in
Figure 26.11. The proof-theoretic interpretation gives us a procedural or computa-
tional approach for computing an answer to the Datalog query. The process of prov-
ing whether a certain fact (theorem) holds is known as theorem proving.

The second type of interpretation is called the model-theoretic interpretation.
Here, given a finite or an infinite domain of constant values,** we assign to a predi-
cate every possible combination of values as arguments. We must then determine
whether the predicate is true or false. In general, it is sufficient to specify the combi-
nations of arguments that make the predicate true, and to state that all other com-
binations make the predicate false. If this is done for every predicate, it is called an
interpretation of the set of predicates. For example, consider the interpretation
shown in Figure 26.13 for the predicates SUPERVISE and SUPERIOR. This interpre-
tation assigns a truth value (true or false) to every possible combination of argu-
ment values (from a finite domain) for the two predicates.

An interpretation is called a model for a specific set of rules if those rules are always
true under that interpretation; that is, for any values assigned to the variables in the
rules, the head of the rules is true when we substitute the truth values assigned to

1. SUPERIOR(X, Y) :- SUPERVISE(X, Y). (rule 1)

2. SUPERIOR(X, Y) :- SUPERVISE(X, Z), SUPERIOR(Z, Y). (rule 2)

3. SUPERVISE(jennifer, ahmad). (ground axiom, given)

4, SUPERVISE(james, jennifer). (ground axiom, given)

5. SUPERIOR (jennifer, ahmad). (apply rule 1 on 3)

6. SUPERIOR(james, ahmad). (apply rule 2 on 4 and 5)

33The most commonly chosen domain is finite and is called the Herbrand Universe.
