identical because of DeMorgan’s theorem.

> A two-level implementation with NOR gates requires that the function be
simplified into product-of-sums form.

> Remember that the simplified product-of-sums expression is obtained from the
map by combining the 0’s and complementing. A product-of-sums expression is
implemented with a first level of OR gates that produce the sum terms followed
by a second-level AND gate to produce the product.

> The transformation from the OR-AND diagram to a NOR diagram is achieved by
changing the OR gates to NOR gates with OR-invert graphic symbols and the
AND gate to a NOR gate with an invert-AND graphic symbol.

> Asingle literal term going into the second-level gate must be complemented.

Figure 3.24 shows the NOR implementation of a function expressed as a product of
sums: F = (A+ B)(C + D)JE

The OR-AND pattern can easily be detected by the removal of the bubbles along the
same line. Variable E is complemented to compensate for the third bubble at the input
of the second-level gate.

The procedure for converting a multilevel AND-OR diagram to an all-NOR diagram is
similar to the one presented for NAND gates. For the NOR case, we must convert
each OR gate to an OR-invert symbol and each AND gate to an invert-AND symbol.
Any bubble that is not compensated by another bubble along the same line needs an
inverter, or the complementation of the input literal.
