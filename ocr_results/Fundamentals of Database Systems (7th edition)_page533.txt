Relational Database Design
Algorithms and Further
Dependencies

C hapter 14 presented a top-down relational design
technique and related concepts used extensively
in commercial database design projects today. The procedure involves designing an
ER or EER conceptual schema and then mapping it to the relational model by a
procedure such as the one described in Chapter 9. Primary keys are assigned to
each relation based on known functional dependencies. In the subsequent process,
which may be called relational design by analysis, initially designed relations from
the above procedure—or those inherited from previous files, forms, and other
sources—are analyzed to detect undesirable functional dependencies. These depen-
dencies are removed by the successive normalization procedure that we described
in Section 14.3 along with definitions of related normal forms, which are succes-
sively better states of design of individual relations. In Section 14.3 we assumed that
primary keys were assigned to individual relations; in Section 14.4 a more general
treatment of normalization was presented where all candidate keys are considered
for each relation, and Section 14.5 discussed a further normal form called BCNF.
Then in Sections 14.6 and 14.7 we discussed two more types of dependencies—
multivalued dependencies and join dependencies—that can also cause redundancies
and showed how they can be eliminated with further normalization.

In this chapter, we use the theory of normal forms and functional, multivalued, and
join dependencies developed in the last chapter and build upon it while maintain-
ing three different thrusts. First, we discuss the concept of inferring new functional
dependencies from a given set and discuss notions including closure, cover, mini-
mal cover, and equivalence. Conceptually, we need to capture the semantics of
