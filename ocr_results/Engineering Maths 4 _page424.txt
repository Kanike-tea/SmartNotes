Probability of a single dice throwing 1,2 or 3 is p =3/6=1/2 -. g=1-p=1/2

The binomial distribution of fitis, N(q+p)" = 96 (12 + 172)

The theoretical frequencies of getting 5,4,3,2,1, Osuccesses with 5 dice are respectively
the successive terms of the binomial expansion.

Thus the hypothesis that the data follows a binomial distribution is rejected.

43. A sample analysis of examination results of 500 students was made. It was found that 220
students had failed, 170 had secured third class 90 had secured second class and 20 had
secured first class. Do these figures support the general examination result which is in the
ratio

4:3:2:1 for the respective categories eos = 781 ,for 3df

>> Let us take the hypothesis that these figures support to the general result in the
ratio4:3:2:1.

The expected frequencies in the respective category are
