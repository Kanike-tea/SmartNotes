Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture

may change the conceptual schema to expand the database (by adding a
record type or data item), to change constraints, or to reduce the database
(by removing a record type or data item). In the last case, external schemas
that refer only to the remaining data should not be affected. For example,
the external schema of Figure 1.5(a) should not be affected by changing the
GRADE_REPORT file (or record type) shown in Figure 1.2 into the one
shown in Figure 1.6(a). Only the view definition and the mappings need to
be changed in a DBMS that supports logical data independence. After the
conceptual schema undergoes a logical reorganization, application pro-
grams that reference the external schema constructs must work as before.
Changes to constraints can be applied to the conceptual schema without
affecting the external schemas or application programs.

. Physical data independence is the capacity to change the internal schema
without having to change the conceptual schema. Hence, the external sche-
mas need not be changed as well. Changes to the internal schema may be
needed because some physical files were reorganized—for example, by cre-
ating additional access structures—to improve the performance of retrieval
or update. If the same data as before remains in the database, we should not
have to change the conceptual schema. For example, providing an access
path to improve retrieval speed of SECTION records (Figure 1.2) by semes-
ter and year should not require a query such as list all sections offered in fall
2008 to be changed, although the query would be executed more efficiently
by the DBMS by utilizing the new access path.

Generally, physical data independence exists in most databases and file environ-
ments where physical details, such as the exact location of data on disk, and hard-
ware details of storage encoding, placement, compression, splitting, merging of
records, and so on are hidden from the user. Applications remain unaware of these
details. On the other hand, logical data independence is harder to achieve because it
allows structural and constraint changes without affecting application programs—a
much stricter requirement.

Whenever we have a multiple-level DBMS, its catalog must be expanded to include
information on how to map requests and data among the various levels. The DBMS
uses additional software to accomplish these mappings by referring to the mapping
information in the catalog. Data independence occurs because when the schema is
changed at some level, the schema at the next higher level remains unchanged; only
the mapping between the two levels is changed. Hence, application programs refer-
ring to the higher-level schema need not be changed.

2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces

In Section 1.4 we discussed the variety of users supported by a DBMS. The DBMS
must provide appropriate languages and interfaces for each category of users. In
this section we discuss the types of languages and interfaces provided by a DBMS
and the user categories targeted by each interface.
