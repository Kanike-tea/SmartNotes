a) Total : When all the entities from an entity set participate in a relationship type, is called total
participation. For example, the participation of the entity set student on the relationship set must
‘opts’ is said to be total because every student enrolled must opt for a course.

b) Partial: When it is not necessary for all the entities from an entity set to particapte in a
relationship type, it is called partial participation. For example, the participation of the entity set
student in ‘represents’ is partial, since not every student in a class is a class representative.

Weak Entity:

Entity types that do not contain any key attribute, and hence can not be identified independently are
called weak entity types. A weak entity can be identified by uniquely only by considering some of
its attributes in conjunction with the primary key attribute of another entity, which is called the
identifying owner entity.

Generally a partial key is attached to a weak entity type that is used for unique identification of
weak entities related to a particular owner type. The following restrictions must hold:
e The owner entity set and the weak entity set must participate in one to may relationship set.
This relationship set is called the identifying relationship set of the weak entity set.
e The weak entity set must have total participation in the identifying relationship.

Example:

Consider the entity type Dependent related to Employee entity, which is used to keep track of the
dependents of each employee. The attributes of Dependents are: name, birthdate, sex and
relationship. Each employee entity set is said to its own the dependent entities that are related to it.
However, not that the ‘Dependent’ entity does not exist of its own, it is dependent on the Employee
entity.

Keys:

Super Key:
A super key is a set of one or more attributes that taken collectively, allow us to identify uniquely an
entity in the entity set. For example , customer-id, (cname, customer-id), (cname, telno)

Candidate Key:
In a relation R, a candidate key for R is a subset of the set of attributes of R, which have the
following properties:
1. Uniqueness: No two distinct tuples in R have the same values for the candidate key
2. Irreducible: No proper subset of the candidate key has the uniqueness property that is
the candidate key. Eg: (cname,telno)

Primary Key:

The primary key is the candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as the principal means
of identifying entities within an entity set. The remaining candidate keys if any, are called Alternate
Key.
