20.3 Desirable Properties of Transactions

dled via the basic LRU (least recently used) page replacement. Although this
achieves better performance on average that basic LRU, it is a static algorithm, and
so does not adapt to dynamically changing loads because the number of available
buffers for each domain is predetermined. Several variations of the DS page
replacement policy have been proposed, which add dynamic load-balancing fea-
tures. For example, the GRU (Group LRU) gives each domain a priority level and
selects pages from the lowest-priority level domain first for replacement, whereas
another method dynamically changes the number of buffers in each domain based
on current workload.

Hot Set Method. This page replacement algorithm is useful in queries that have
to scan a set of pages repeatedly, such as when a join operation is performed using
the nested-loop method (see Chapter 18). If the inner loop file is loaded completely
into main memory buffers without replacement (the hot set), the join will be per-
formed efficiently because each page in the outer loop file will have to scan all the
records in the inner loop file to find join matches. The hot set method determines
for each database processing algorithm the set of disk pages that will be accessed
repeatedly, and it does not replace them until their processing is completed.

The DBMIN Method. This page replacement policy uses a model known as QLSM
(query locality set model), which predetermines the pattern of page references for
each algorithm for a particular type of database operation. We discussed various
algorithms for relational operations such as SELECT and JOIN in Chapter 18.
Depending on the type of access method, the file characteristics, and the algorithm
used, the QLSM will estimate the number of main memory buffers needed for each
file involved in the operation. The DBMIN page replacement policy will calculate a
locality set using QLSM for each file instance involved in the query (some queries
may reference the same file twice, so there would be a locality set for each file
instance needed in the query). DBMIN then allocates the appropriate number of
buffers to each file instance involved in the query based on the locality set for that
file instance. The concept of locality set is analogous to the concept of working set,
which is used in page replacement policies for processes by the operating system
but there are multiple locality sets, one for each file instance in the query.

20.3 Desirable Properties of Transactions

Transactions should possess several properties, often called the ACID properties;
they should be enforced by the concurrency control and recovery methods of the
DBMS. The following are the ACID properties:

= Atomicity. A transaction is an atomic unit of processing; it should either be
performed in its entirety or not performed at all.

= Consistency preservation. A transaction should be consistency preserving,
meaning that if it is completely executed from beginning to end without
interference from other transactions, it should take the database from one
consistent state to another.
