Chapter 19 Query Optimization

Exercises

19.15. Develop cost functions for the PROJECT, UNION, INTERSECTION, SET
DIFFERENCE, and CARTESIAN PRODUCT algorithms discussed in Section 19.4.

19.16. Develop cost functions for an algorithm that consists of two SELECTs, a
JOIN, and a final PROJECT, in terms of the cost functions for the individual
operations.

19.17. Develop a pseudo-language-style algorithm for describing the dynamic
programming procedure for join-order selection.

19.18. Calculate the cost functions for different options of executing the JOIN
operation OP7 discussed in Section 19.4.

19.19. Develop formulas for the hybrid hash-join algorithm for calculating the size
of the buffer for the first bucket. Develop more accurate cost estimation
formulas for the algorithm.

19.20. Estimate the cost of operations OP6 and OP7 using the formulas developed
in Exercise 19.19.

19.21. Compare the cost of two different query plans for the following query:
OSalary< 40000(EMPLOYEE 04 pno=DnumbeOEPARTMENT)

Use the database statistics shown in Figure 19.6.

Selected Bibliography

This bibliography provides literature references for the topics of query processing
and optimization. We discussed query processing algorithms and strategies in the
previous chapter, but it is difficult to separate the literature that addresses optimiza-
tion from the literature that addresses query processing strategies and algorithms.
Hence, the bibliography is consolidated.

A detailed algorithm for relational algebra optimization is given by Smith and
Chang (1975). The Ph.D. thesis of Kooi (1980) provides a foundation for query
processing techniques. A survey paper by Jarke and Koch (1984) gives a taxonomy
of query optimization and includes a bibliography of work in this area. A survey by
Graefe (1993) discusses query execution in database systems and includes an exten-
sive bibliography.

Whang (1985) discusses query optimization in OBE (Office-By-Example), which is
a system based on the language QBE. Cost-based optimization was introduced in
the SYSTEM R experimental DBMS and is discussed in Astrahan et al. (1976).
Selinger et al. (1979) is a classic paper that discussed cost-based optimization of
multiway joins in SYSTEM R. Join algorithms are discussed in Gotlieb (1975), Blas-
gen and Eswaran (1976), and Whang et al. (1982). Hashing algorithms for imple-
menting joins are described and analyzed in DeWitt et al. (1984), Bratbergsengen
