The condition flags set by these instructions are then used by conditional execution features of ARM
instructions (like conditional branch instructions) to control program flow71 ....

11a) RISC Design * The RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) design philosophy aims to reduce
the complexity of instructions performed by the hardware, shifting greater flexibility and intelligence
to the software (compiler)17 . This philosophy is implemented with four major design rules16 : *
Reduced Number of Instructions: RISC processors have a smaller set of instruction classes, each
performing simple operations that can ideally execute in a single cycle16 . Complex operations are
achieved by combining multiple simple instructions16 . * Fixed Length Instructions: Instructions in
RISC are of a fixed length, which simplifies the process of fetching future instructions in the pipeline
before decoding the current one2 . This contrasts with CISC processors that often have variable-
length instructions2 . * Large General-Purpose Register Set: RISC machines feature a large number
of general-purpose registers, where any register can hold either data or an address. These registers
serve as fast local memory for all data processing operations18 . * Load-Store Architecture: RISC
processors operate on data held in registers. Separate load and store instructions are used to
transfer data between the register bank and external memory18 . Data processing instructions
cannot directly manipulate data in memory33 . This separation aims to optimize performance by
allowing multiple accesses to data within registers without repeated memory accesses19 .

Processor Modes Associated with CPSR Register

The processor mode is a part of the control field within the Current Program Status Register
(cpsr)49 .... The processor mode determines several aspects of the processor's operationS0O :

Which registers are active: The ARM architecture employs banked registers, where different
processor modes have access to different sets of registers (e.g., r13 and r14 are banked for various
exception modes)54 .... The current mode dictates which register bank is in use102 .

Access rights to the cpsr itself: Processor modes are categorized as either privileged or non-
privileged (User)50 . Privileged modes (Abort, FIQ, IRQ, Supervisor, System, Undefined) have full
read-write access to the cpsr, allowing them to change the mode, interrupt masks, and flags5O . Non-
privileged User mode only permits read access to the control field and read-write access to the
condition flags53 .

There are seven processor modes in total53 :

User (usr): Non-privileged mode for executing applications54 .

Supervisor (svc): Privileged mode the processor enters after reset and typically used by the operating
system kernel53 ....
