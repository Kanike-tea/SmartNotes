of the search term. ‘~’ is equivalent to AND NOT and means to exclude the term;
the ‘~’ should be placed directly in front of the search term not wanted. Complex
Boolean queries can be built out of these operators and their combinations, and
they are evaluated according to the classical rules of Boolean algebra. No ranking is
possible, because a document either satisfies such a query (is “relevant”) or does not
satisfy it (is “nonrelevant”). A document is retrieved for a Boolean query if the
query is logically true as an exact match in the document. Users generally do not
use combinations of these complex Boolean operators, and IR systems support a
restricted version of these set operators. Boolean retrieval models can directly sup-
port different Boolean operator implementations for these kinds of queries.

27.3.3 Phrase Queries

When documents are represented using an inverted keyword index for searching,
the relative order of the terms in the document is lost. In order to perform exact
phrase retrieval, these phrases should be encoded in the inverted index or imple-
mented differently (with relative positions of word occurrences in documents). A
phrase query consists of a sequence of words that makes up a phrase. The phrase is
generally enclosed within double quotes. Each retrieved document must contain at
least one instance of the exact phrase. Phrase searching is a more restricted and spe-
cific version of proximity searching that we mention below. For example, a phrase
searching query could be ‘conceptual database design’. If phrases are indexed by the
retrieval model, any retrieval model can be used for these query types. A phrase the-
saurus may also be used in semantic models for fast dictionary searching of phrases.

27.3.4 Proximity Queries

Proximity search refers to a search that accounts for how close within a record mul-
tiple terms should be to each other. The most commonly used proximity search
option is a phrase search that requires terms to be in the exact order. Other proxim-
ity operators can specify how close terms should be to each other. Some will also
specify the order of the search terms. Each search engine can define proximity
operators differently, and the search engines use various operator names such as
NEAR, ADJ(adjacent), or AFTER. In some cases, a sequence of single words is
given, together with a maximum allowed distance between them. Vector space
models that also maintain information about positions and offsets of tokens (words)
have robust implementations for this query type. However, providing support for
complex proximity operators becomes computationally expensive because it
requires the time-consuming preprocessing of documents and is thus suitable for
smaller document collections rather than for the Web.

27.3.5 Wildcard Queries

Wildcard searching is generally meant to support regular expressions and pattern
matching-based searching in text. In IR systems, certain kinds of wildcard search sup-
port may be implemented—usually words with any trailing characters (for example,
‘data® would retrieve data, database, datapoint, dataset, and so on). Providing full support
