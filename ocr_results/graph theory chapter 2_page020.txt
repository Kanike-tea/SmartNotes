2.3. Detection of 11

As per step 4, we have to eliminate the vertices of degree 2 by merging the edges incident
on these vertices. Thus, we merge (i) the edges e, and e2 into an edge eyo (say) and (ii) the
edges és and e7 into an edge 1; (say). The resulting graph will be as shown below.

As per step 3, let us remove one of the parallel edges es and 19 and one of the parallel
edges e3 and e);. The graph got by removing e19 and e;; will be as shown below:

As per step 4, we merge the edges 3 and eg into an edge e12 (say) to get the following
