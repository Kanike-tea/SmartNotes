1S. A sample of 100 days is taken front meteorological records of a certain-district and 1 0 of

thent are found to be foggy. What are the probable, limits of the percentage of foggy days
in the district. ;

>> p = proportion of foggy days in a sample of 100 days is given by 10/100 = 0.1
Hence q = 1-p = 0.9 .

probable limits of foggy days
= p +258 Vpq/n
= 0.1 + 258 V(0.1 x 0.9)/100
= 0.1 + 0.0774 = 0.0226 and 0.1774
= 226 % and 17.74 %

Thus the percentage of foggy days lies between 2.26 and 17.74

16. A random sample of 500 apples was taken from a large consignment and 65 were found
to be bad. Estimate the proportion of bad apples in the consignment as well as the standard
error of the estimate. Also find the percentage of bad apples in the consignment.

>> p = proportion of bad apples in the sample is given by 65/500 = 0.13.
_ Hence q = 1-p = 0.87
S.E proportion of bad apples = \pq/n = (0.13 0.87) 7500. = 0.015
Probable limits of bad apples in the consignment ‘
= p £258 Vpq/n
= 0.13 + 2.58 (0.015) = 0.13 + 0.0387
" 20,0913, and 0.1687
2913 % and 1687% =

Thus the required percentage of bad apples in the consignment lies between 9.13
and 16.87 . .

17. Ina locality of 18000 families a sample of 840 families was selected at random. Of these
840 families, 206 families were found to have monthly income of Rs.2500 or less. It was
desired to estimate how many of the 18,000 families have monthly income of Rs.2500
or less, Within what limits would you place your estimate.

>> Proportion of families having monthly income of Rs.2500 or less is given by
p = 206/840 = 0.245. Hence q = 1-p = 0.755
S.E proportion = Ypq/n = V(0.245 x 0.755)/840 = 0.015

Probable limits of families having monthly income of Rs.2500 or less are

-*p + 2.58 Vpq/n. Thatis,
