Cells are the fundamental unit of life. They range in size from 0.0001 mm to nearly

150 mm across.

Functions of Cell

Ace

Il performs major functions essential for the growth and development of an organism.

Important functions of cell are as follows:

1.

Provides Support and Structure: All the organisms are made up of cells. They
form the structural basis of all the organisms. The cell wall and the cell membrane
are the main components that function to provide support and structure to the
organism. For eg., the skin is made up of a large number of cells. Xylem present in

the vascular plants is made of cells that provide structural support to the plants.

2. Facilitate Growth Mitosis: In the process of mitosis, the parent cell divides into

the daughter cells. Thus, the cells multiply and facilitate the growth in an organism.

3. Allows Transport of Substances: Various nutrients are imported by the cells to

carry out various chemical processes going on inside the cells. The waste produced
by the chemical processes is eliminated from the cells by active and passive
transport. Small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and ethanol diffuse
across the cell membrane along the concentration gradient. This is known as passive
transport. The larger molecules diffuse across the cell membrane through active

transport where the cells require a lot of energy to transport the substances.

4. Energy Production: Cells require energy to carry out various chemical processes.

This energy is produced by the cells through a process called photosynthesis in

plants and respiration in animals.
