Example of a grid array on
Dno and Age attributes.

Thus our request for Dno = 4 and Age = 59 maps into the cell (1, 5) corresponding
to the grid array. The records for this combination will be found in the correspond-
ing bucket. This method is particularly useful for range queries that would map into
a set of cells corresponding to a group of values along the linear scales. If a range
query corresponds to a match on the some of the grid cells, it can be processed by
accessing exactly the buckets for those grid cells. For example, a query for Dno < 5
and Age > 40 refers to the data in the top bucket shown in Figure 17.14.

The grid file concept can be applied to any number of search keys. For example, for
n search keys, the grid array would have n dimensions. The grid array thus allows a
partitioning of the file along the dimensions of the search key attributes and provides
an access by combinations of values along those dimensions. Grid files perform well
in terms of reduction in time for multiple key access. However, they represent a
space overhead in terms of the grid array structure. Moreover, with dynamic files, a
frequent reorganization of the file adds to the maintenance cost.!*

17.5.1 Hash Indexes

It is also possible to create access structures similar to indexes that are based on
hashing. The hash index is a secondary structure to access the file by using hashing
ona search key other than the one used for the primary data file organization. The
index entries are of the type <K, Pr> or <K, P>, where Pr is a pointer to the record
containing the key, or P is a pointer to the block containing the record for that key.
The index file with these index entries can be organized as a dynamically expand-
able hash file, using one of the techniques described in Section 16.8.3; searching for
an entry uses the hash search algorithm on K. Once an entry is found, the pointer Pr

'4insertion/deletion algorithms for grid files may be found in Nievergelt et al. (1984).
