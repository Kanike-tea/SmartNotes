LAB PROGRAM 06 (b)

6 b) Write a Python program to illustrate liner plotting with line formatting using

Matplotlib.

Aim: Demonstration of how to draw a liner plotting with line formatting using Matplotlib.
PROGRAM EXPLANATION

The below program demonstrates how to draw a Pie chart using Matplotlib. Make sure you have

Matplotlib installed before running this code. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

pip install matplotlib

1. ‘import matplotlib.pyplot as plt’: This line imports the ‘matplotlib.pyplot’ module and
assigns it the alias ‘plt’. This module provides a collection of functions for creating
various types of plots and charts.

2. Sample data for the linear plot:

e ‘x’: A list of x-axis data points representing the independent variable.

e ‘y’: A list of y-axis data points representing the dependent variable. Each y-value
corresponds to an x-value.

3. Creating the linear plot with line formatting:

e ‘plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', color=blue’, linestyle='--', linewidth=2, markersize=8,
label='Data Points')’: This line creates a line plot using the plot function. It takes
several arguments:

= ‘x’ and ‘y’ are the data points to be plotted.

= marker='o' specifies circular markers at each data point.

= color='blue' sets the color of the line and markers to blue.

= linestyle='--' specifies that the line connecting the data points should be a
dashed line.

= linewidth=2 sets the line width to 2 points.

= markersize=8 sets the marker size to 8 points.

= label='Data Points' provides a label for this data series. This label is used
to create a legend later.

4. Adding labels and a title:

e  plt.xlabel('X-Axis') and plt.ylabel('Y-Axis'): These two lines add labels to the x-
axis and y-axis, respectively. In this code, 'X-Axis' is used as the x-axis label, and

'Y-Axis' is used as the y-axis label.
