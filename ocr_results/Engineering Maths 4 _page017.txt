Modified Euler's Method

d
Consider the initial value problem = =f(%Y) Fy (2%) = Yp-
We need to find y atx, = xq + h.

We first obtain y(x,) = y, by applying Euler's formula and this value is regarded
as the initial approximation for y, usually denoted by yf) also called as the
predicted value of y, . ;

Euler's formula is given by
i = Yq t hf (xy Yo)
Since the accuracy is poor in this formula this value y, is successively improved

(corrected) to the desired degree of accuracy by the followingModified Euler's formula,

where the successive approximations are denoted by yf), yf?) ¥), we. ete
