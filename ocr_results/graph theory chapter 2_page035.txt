2.5.1 Chromatic Polynomials

Given a graph G and A number of different colours, let us take up the problem of finding the
number of different ways of properly colouring G with these 2 colours.

First, consider the null graph.N,, with n vertices. In this graph, no two vertices are adjacent.
Therefore, a proper colouring of this graph can be done by assigning a single colour to all the
vertices. Thus, if the number of different colours available is A, then each vertex of the graph
has A possible choices of colours assigned to it, and as such the graph can be properly coloured
in A” different ways.

Next, consider the complete graph K,,. In this graph, every two vertices are adjacent, and
as such there must be at least n colours for'a proper colouring of the graph. If the number of
different colours available is A, then the number of ways of properly colouring Ky is (i) zer0 #

A <n, (ii) one if A = n, and (iii) greater than | if A >n. Let V1, V2, ¥3,...Vq be the vertices of

K,, and suppose A > n. For a proper colouring of K,, the vertex v; can be assigned any of the
colours, the vertex v2 can be assigned any of the remaining

assigned any of the remaining A—2 colours’and finally the

A-n+ 1 colours. Thus, K, can be properly coloured in AC
ways if A> n.

= 1 colours, \he vertex v3 can be

a
vertex v, can be assigned any of the
A~1)(A~2)...(A—n+ 1) differe™
