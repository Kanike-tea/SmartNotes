Haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs):

Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) are “made of” natural hemoglobins due
to their ability to release oxygen.

Compared with traditional preservation protocols, they extend preservation time,
reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury to grafts, improves graft quality, and even
increases the number of transplantable donors.

These solutions contain purified hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying
oxygen in red blood cells.

HBOCs can be derived from human blood, animal sources, or genetically modified
microbes.

The goal is to have a stable and long-lasting hemoglobin-based solution that can
safely deliver oxygen to tissues.

Answer:

Bio printing is defined as the printing of structures consisting of living cells, bio
materials and active bio molecules.

Pressure-assisted bio-printing is based on the extrusion of biomaterials out of the nozzle

of the printer in order to fabricate a 3D biological structure. Some of the common

biomaterial used in this method includes hydrogels, cells and proteins, and ceramic

material solutions, collagen and chitosan, etc.
