2. Deletion can result in unused space/need for reorganization

Sequential file organization:

The most basic way to organize the collection of records in a file is to use sequential organization.
Records of the file are stored in sequence by the primary key field values/ They are accessible only
in the order stored i.e, in the primary key order. This kind is of file organization works well for tasks
which need to access nearly every record in a file. Eg. Payroll.

In a sequentially organized file records are written consecutively when the file is created and must
be accessed consecutively when the file later used for input.

A sequential file maintains the records in the logical sequence of its primary key values. Sequential
file are inefficient for random access. And files can be stored on devices like magnetic tape that
allow sequential access. As records are in sorted order it will use binary search technique to search
for a record.

Advantages of sequential file organization:
e It is fast and efficient when dealing with large volumes of data that need to be processed
periodically(batch system)
Disadvantages of sequential file organization:
e Requires that all new transactions be sorted into the proper sequence for sequential access
processing
¢ Locating, storing, modifying, deleting or adding records in the file require rearranging the
file/
¢ This method is too slow to handle application requiring immediate updating or responses.

Indexed sequential file organization:
It organized the file like a large dictionary, i.e, records are stored in order of the key, but an
index is kept which also permits a type of direct access. The records are stored sequentially by
primary key values and there is an index built over the primary key field.
An index is a set of index value, address pairs. Indexing associates a set of objects to a set pf
orderable quantities, that are usually smaller in number or their properties. Thus an index is a
mechanism for faster search. Although the indices and the data blocks are kept physically, they
are logically distinct.
A sequential file that is indexed on its primary key is called an index sequential file. The index
allows for random access to records, while the sequential storage of the records of the file
provides easy access to the sequential records. An addition feature of this file system is the
overflow area. The overflow area provides additional space for record addition without the need
to create.

Advantage of ISAM indexes:
1. Because the whole structure is ordered to a large extent, partial (like ty%) and
range(between 12 and 29) based retrievals can often benefit from the use of this type of
index.
2. ISAM is good for static tables because there are usually fewer index levels than B-tree
3. In general there are fewer disk I/Os required to access data, provided there is no overflow.
Disadvantage of ISAM indexes:

1. ISAM is still not as quick as some in hash file organization

2. Overflow can be a real problem in highly volatile table.
