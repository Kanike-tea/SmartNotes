Effective Oxygen Transport:

Human blood substitutes must be capable of efficiently carrying and delivering oxygen to
the body's tissues. This is a fundamental function of natural blood that any substitute
should be able to replicate or improve upon.

Safety and Compatibility:

Blood substitutes should be safe for use in the human body and well-tolerated by the
recipient. They should not cause significant adverse reactions, toxicity, or immune
responses. Additionally, they should not interfere with normal blood clotting or other
essential physiological processes.

Storage and Transport:

Human blood substitutes should be stable and capable of being stored and transported
easily. This is particularly important in emergency situations or areas where access to
blood products may be limited. The ability to store and transport substitutes effectively
ensures their availability when needed.

Cost-Effectiveness and Scalability:

Blood substitutes should be cost-effective and scalable for widespread use in
medical settings. They should be affordable and feasible to produce in large quantities,
meeting the potential demand for blood products.

Types of HBS

There are two types of human blood substitutes - hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers
(HBOCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

HBOCs are based on the hemoglobin molecule, which is the protein in red blood cells
that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Hemoglobin is extracted from human or animal
blood and then modified to create a stable, synthetic version. When introduced into the
body, HBOCs can help to increase the amount of oxygen available to the tissues, which
can be important in situations where the body is unable to produce or transport enough
red blood cells.

PFCs are synthetic molecules that are similar in structure to the hemoglobin
molecule. However, unlike HBOCs, they do not require modification from natural
sources. PFCs are ableto dissolve oxygen and transport it throughout the body, similar to
the way that red blood cells work.

4.8.1 Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers (HBOCs)

Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) are a type of human blood substitute that is
designed to carry and deliver oxygen to the body's tissues. They are made by isolating
hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells, and
formulating it into a solution or suspension that can be infused into a_ patient's
bloodstream.
