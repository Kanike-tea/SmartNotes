e Renewability: Lipids are a renewable resource, and they can be produced from a
variety of sources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and microalgae.

e Reduced emissions: Biodiesel produces fewer emissions compared to traditional
diesel fuel, reducing the impact on the environment and public health.

e Improved performance: Biodiesel can improve engine performance, increasing fuel
efficiency and reducing engine wear and tear.

e Biodegradability: Biodiesel is biodegradable, which reduces the risk of environmental

contamination in the event of a spill.

However, there are also some limitations to the use of lipids as biodiesel, such as higher
production costs compared to traditional diesel fuel and the need for more efficient and cost-
effective processing methods. Nevertheless, the use of lipids as biodiesel has the potential to

play an important role in the transition towards a more sustainable energy system.

1. Raw material preparation: The lipids, such as vegetable oils or animal fats, are

collected and purified to remove impurities.

2. Transesterification: The purified lipids are mixed with an alcohol, such as methanol,
and a catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide, to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAME),
which are the main components of biodiesel. This process is known as
transesterification.

3. Separation: The reaction mixture is then separated into two layers: the upper layer
contains the FAME (biodiesel) and the lower layer contains the glycerol (byproduct).

4. Washing and drying: The biodiesel is washed with water to remove any residual
alcohol and soap that was formed during the transesterification reaction. The biodiesel

is then dried to remove any remaining moisture.
