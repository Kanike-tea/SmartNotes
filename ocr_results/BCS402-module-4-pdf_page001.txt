MICROCONTROLLER(BCS402)

Exception handling is the method of processing these exceptions.Most
exceptions have an associated software exception handler. Software
exception handler are software routine that executes when an exception
occurs. The handler first determines the cause of the exception and then
services the exception.Servicing takes place either within the handler or
by branching to a specific service routine.

The Reset exception is a special case of exception and it is used to
initialize an embedded system.

4.1.1 ARM Processor Exceptions and Modes

Whenever an exception occurs, the core enter a specific mode. The ARM
processor modes can be entered manually by changing the cpsr.

When an exception occurs the ARM processor always switches to ARM
state. Figure 4.1 shows an exceptions and associated modes.

Figure 4.1 Exceptions and associated modes.
The user and system mode are the only two modes that are not entered
by an exception.
When an exception causes a mode change, the core automatically
m saves the cpsr to the spsr of the exception mode
m saves the pc to the Ir of the exception mode
m sets the cpsr to the exception mode
m sets pc to the address of the exception handler

4.1.2 Vector Table

The vector table is a table of addresses that the ARM core branches to
when an exception is raised.These addresses contain branch instructions
The memory map address 0x00000000 is reserved for the vector table, a
set of 32-bit words. On some processors the vector table can be optionally
located at a higher address in memory (starting at the offset Oxffff0000).
