Chapter 13. XML: Extensible Markup Language

set of elements (tag names) that a program processing the document knows to
expect. This gives the document creator the freedom to specify new elements but
limits the possibilities for automatically interpreting the meaning or semantics of
the elements within the document.

A stronger criterion is for an XML document to be valid. In this case, the document
must be well formed, and it must follow a particular schema. That is, the element
names used in the start and end tag pairs must follow the structure specified in a
separate XML DTD (Document Type Definition) file or XML schema file. We
first discuss XML DTD here, and then we give an overview of XML schema in Sec-
tion 13.3.2. Figure 13.4 shows a simple XML DTD file, which specifies the elements
(tag names) and their nested structures. Any valid documents conforming to this
DTD should follow the specified structure. A special syntax exists for specifying
DTD files, as illustrated in Figure 13.4(a). First, a name is given to the root tag of
the document, which is called Projects in the first line in Figure 13.4. Then the ele-
ments and their nested structure are specified.

When specifying elements, the following notation is used:

= A* following the element name means that the element can be repeated zero
or more times in the document. This kind of element is known as an optional
multivalued (repeating) element.

= A + following the element name means that the element can be repeated one
or more times in the document. This kind of element is a required multival-
ued (repeating) element.

= A ? following the element name means that the element can be repeated zero
or one times. This kind is an optional single-valued (nonrepeating) element.

= An element appearing without any of the preceding three symbols must
appear exactly once in the document. This kind is a required single-valued
(nonrepeating) element.

= The type of the element is specified via parentheses following the element. If
the parentheses include names of other elements, these latter elements are
the children of the element in the tree structure. If the parentheses include
the keyword #PCDATA or one of the other data types available in XML DTD,
the element is a leaf node. PCDATA stands for parsed character data, which is
roughly similar to a string data type.

= The list of attributes that can appear within an element can also be specified
via the keyword !ATTLIST. In Figure 13.3, the Project element has an attribute
Projld. If the type of an attribute is ID, then it can be referenced from another
attribute whose type is IDREF within another element. Notice that attributes
can also be used to hold the values of simple data elements of type #PCDATA.

= Parentheses can be nested when specifying elements.

= Abar symbol (¢; | e2 ) specifies that either e; or e2 can appear in the document.
We can see that the tree structure in Figure 13.1 and the XML document in Fig-

ure 13.3 conform to the XML DTD in Figure 13.4. To require that an XML
document be checked for conformance to a DTD, we must specify this in the
