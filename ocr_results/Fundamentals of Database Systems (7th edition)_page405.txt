12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts

A type in its simplest form has a type name and a list of visible (public) functions.
When specifying a type in this section, we use the following format, which does not
specify arguments of functions, to simplify the discussion:

TYPE_NAME: function, function, ... , function

For example, a type that describes characteristics of a PERSON may be defined as
follows:

PERSON: Name, Address, Birth_date, Age, Ssn

In the PERSON type, the Name, Address, Ssn, and Birth_date functions can be imple-
mented as stored attributes, whereas the Age function can be implemented as an
operation that calculates the Age from the value of the Birth_date attribute and the
current date.

The concept of subtype is useful when the designer or user must create a new type that
is similar but not identical to an already defined type. The subtype then inherits all the
functions of the predefined type, which is referred to as the supertype. For example,
suppose that we want to define two new types EMPLOYEE and STUDENT as follows:

EMPLOYEE: Name, Address, Birth_date, Age, Ssn, Salary, Hire_date, Seniority
STUDENT: Name, Address, Birth_date, Age, Ssn, Major, Gpa

Since both STUDENT and EMPLOYEE include all the functions defined for PERSON
plus some additional functions of their own, we can declare them to be subtypes of
PERSON. Each will inherit the previously defined functions of PERSON—namely,
Name, Address, Birth_date, Age, and Ssn. For STUDENT, it is only necessary to define
the new (local) functions Major and Gpa, which are not inherited. Presumably, Major
can be defined as a stored attribute, whereas Gpa may be implemented as an opera-
tion that calculates the student’s grade point average by accessing the Grade values
that are internally stored (hidden) within each STUDENT object as hidden attributes.
For EMPLOYEE, the Salary and Hire_date functions may be stored attributes, whereas
Seniority may be an operation that calculates Seniority from the value of Hire_date.

Therefore, we can declare EMPLOYEE and STUDENT as follows:

EMPLOYEE subtype-of PERSON: Salary, Hire_date, Seniority
STUDENT subtype-of PERSON: Major, Gpa

In general, a subtype includes all of the functions that are defined for its supertype
plus some additional functions that are specific only to the subtype. Hence, it is pos-
sible to generate a type hierarchy to show the supertype/subtype relationships
among all the types declared in the system.

As another example, consider a type that describes objects in plane geometry, which
may be defined as follows:

GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Shape, Area, Reference_point

For the GEOMETRY_OBJECT type, Shape is implemented as an attribute (its domain
can be an enumerated type with values ‘triangle’, ‘rectangle’, ‘circle’, and so on), and
