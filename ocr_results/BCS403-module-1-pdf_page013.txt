Database Management System [BCS403]

It is the responsibility of the database designers to identify integrity constraints during database

design.

9. Permitting Inferencing and Actions Using Rules
In a deductive database system, one may specify declarative rules that allow the database to
infer new data. For example, figure out which students are on academic probation. Such
capabilities would take the place of application programs that would be used to ascertain such
information otherwise.
Active database systems go one step further by allowing "active rules" that can be used to
initiate actions automatically. In today’s relational database systems, it is possible to associate

triggers with tables.

10. Additional Implications of Using the Database Approach

= Potential for Enforcing Standards : database approach permits the DBA to define and

enforce standards among database users ina large organization which facilitates

communication and cooperation among various departments, projects, and users within the

organization.Standards can be defined for names and formats of data elements, display

formats, report structures and so on.

= Reduced Application Development »Time: once a database is up and running,
substantially less time is generally required to create new applications using DBMS
facilities. Development time using a DBMS is estimated to be one-sixth to one-fourth of
that for a traditional file system.

= Flexibility: It may be necessary to change the structure of a database as _ requirements
change. DBMSs allow changes to the structure of the database without affecting the stored

data and the existing application programs.

= Availability of Up-to-Date Information: DBMS makes the database available to all users.
Availability of up-to-date information is essential for many transaction-processing
applications, such as reservation systems or banking databases

= Economies of Scale: DBMS approach permits consolidation of data and applications, to
overlap between activities of data-processing in different projects or departments. This
enables the whole organization to invest in more powerful processors, storage devices, or
communication gear, rather than having each department purchase its equipment thus

reducing overall costs of operation and management.
