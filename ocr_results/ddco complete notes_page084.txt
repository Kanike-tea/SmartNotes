COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

The structure of memory for 16 bit CPU, 32 bit CPU and 64 bit CPU are as shown in the figures
1,2 and 3 respectively

For 16 bit CPU For 32 bit CPU For 64 bit CPU
5000 [34H 5000 [34H 5000 [34H
5002 65H 5004 65H 5008 65H
5004 | 86H 5008 | 86H 5016 | 86H
5006 93H 5012 93H 5024 93H
5008 | 45H 5016 | 45H 5032 [45H

It is process of assignment of addresses of two successive words andthis address is the number of
bytes in the word is called as Word alignment.

ACCESSING CHARACTERS AND NUMBERS

The character occupies 1 byte of memory and hence byte address for memory.
The numbers occupies 2 bytes of memory and hence word. address for numbers.

6. MEMORY OPERATION
Both progfam instrilétionsiand operands are in memory. To execute each instruction has
to be fead from memory andlaftemexeciltion the results must be written to memory. There
aretWo types of memory operations namely |. Memory read and 2. Memory write
Memory read operation [ Load/ Read / Fetch |
Memory write operation [ Store/ write ]

1. MEMORY READ OPERATION:

It iSthe process of transféffing of 1 word of data from memory into Accumulator (GPR).
It is also called as Memory fetch operation.

The Memory read operation can be implemented by means of LOAD instruction.

The LOAD instruction transfers 1 word of data (1 word = 32 bits) from Memory into the
Accumulator as shown in the fig.
