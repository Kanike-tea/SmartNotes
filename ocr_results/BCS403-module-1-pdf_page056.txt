creating the subclass HOURLY_EMPLOYEE of EMPLOYEE and relating the subclass to
an entity type TRADE_UNION via the BELONGS_TO relationship type
In summary, the specialization process allows us to do the following:
= Define a set of subclasses of an entity type
« Establish additional specific attributes with each subclass
« Establish additional specific relationship types between each subclass and other entity types
or other subclasses
3.8.2 Generalization
Generalization process can be viewed as being functionally the inverse of the specialization
process. It is a process of defining a generalized entity type from the given entity types.
Generalization is the reverse process of abstraction in which we suppress the differences among

several entity types, identify their common features, and generalize them into a single superclass

For example, consider the entity types CAR and TRUCK shown in Figure 3.8.2(a).
