© Properties of a Regular Stochastic Matrix 7

The following properties are associated witha regular stochastic matrix P oforder n.
1. (a) P has a unique ‘fixed point x = ( 5 Ae ea “x, ) such eo xP=x.

(b) P has a unique fixed probability: vector v = (0, rr) such that. .

vP =v where v=
n
i=1 ”

2. P, pe , *** approaches the matrix V a teiaididiiasis iis probability
vector v. “a

3. If u is any probability vector then the sequence of vectors uP, uP,
approaches the unique fixed probability vector v.

We have to prove that (v, a; +, b, )+( 0, a, +0, by ) =1
LHS = v, (a, +4))+0)(b, +b.) = 0, - 1+, + 1= 2,40, =1

Thus v Ais also a probability vector.

48. Prove with reference to two second order stochastic matrices that their: product i is also a"
stochastic matrix. ,
