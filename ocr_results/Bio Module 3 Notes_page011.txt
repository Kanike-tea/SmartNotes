Parts of the Human Eye

Sclera: The outer covering of the eye is called the sclera. It is a protective tough white
layer (white part of the eye).

Cornea: The transparent part in front of the sclera is called the cornea. Light enters the eye
through the cornea, it bends(refracts) the light passes through it. It also protects the eye and
also doesn't allow foreign particles to enter the eye.

Iris: It is a dark, muscular tissue and ring-like structure present behind the cornea. The
colour of the eye is due to the colour of the iris. The iris regulates the amount and intensity
of light entering the eyes by adjusting the size of the iris.

Pupil: The pupil is a small opening in the iris. The iris controls the size of the pupil. The
pupil’s function is to adjust the amount of light entering the eye.

Lens: The transparent portion situated behind the pupil is called the lens (convex lens
which thicker at the center than the edges). It focusses all the light at one point. The lens
alters the shape to focus light on the retina, with the help of ciliary muscles. It becomes
small to focus on objects at a distance and becomes big to focus on nearby objects.
Retina: It’s the inner boundary of the eye. It is the light-sensitive layer that consists of
nerve cells. Its function is to convert the images formed by the lens into electrical impulses.
These electrical impulses are then transmitted through optic nerves to the brain.

Optic Nerves: Light coming from retina is sensed by the nerve cells. You can find two
types of optic nerves, which are cones and rods.

Cones: Cones are the nerve cells that are more sensitive to bright light. Cones help in
central and colour vision.

Rods: Rods are the nerve cells that are more sensitive to dim lights. Rodes help in
peripheral vision.

The message or sensation is then transferred to the brain along the optic nerve.
