Section 2.5. It is now more common to use a three-tier architecture rather than a
two-tier architecture, particularly in Web applications. This architecture is illus-
trated in Figure 23.10.

In the three-tier client/server architecture, the following three layers exist:

1. Presentation layer (client). This provides the user interface and interacts
with the user. The programs at this layer present Web interfaces or forms to
the client in order to interface with the application. Web browsers are often
utilized, and the languages and specifications used include HTML, XHTML,
CSS, Flash, MathML, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Java, JavaScript,
Adobe Flex, and others. This layer handles user input, output, and naviga-
tion by accepting user commands and displaying the needed information,
usually in the form of static or dynamic Web pages. The latter are employed
when the interaction involves database access. When a Web interface is
used, this layer typically communicates with the application layer via the
HTTP protocol.

2. Application layer (business logic). This layer programs the application
logic. For example, queries can be formulated based on user input from the
client, or query results can be formatted and sent to the client for presenta-
tion. Additional application functionality can be handled at this layer, such
as security checks, identity verification, and other functions. The application
layer can interact with one or more databases or data sources as needed by
connecting to the database using ODBC, JDBC, SQL/CLI, or other database
access techniques.
