Digital Design &Computer Organization(BCS302) Module -4

The single bus organization consists of

Memory

Processor

System bus

1/O device

The system bus consists of 3 types of buses:

oo0o°o

o Address bus (Unidirectional)
o Data bus (Bidirectional)
o Control bus (Bidirectional)

The system bus enables all the devices connected to it to involve in the data
transfer operation.

The system bus establishes data communication between I/O device and
processor.

Each I/O device is assigned a unique set of address.

When processor places an address on address-lines, the intended-
device responds to thecommand.

The processor requests either a read or write-operation.

The requested data are transferred over the data-lines

Steps for input operation:

The address bus of system bus holds the address of the input device.
The control unit of CPU generates IORD Control signal.
When this control signal is activated the processor reads the data from

the input device(DATAIN) into the CPU register.

Steps for output operation:

The address bus of system bus holds the address of the output device.

The control unit of CPU generates IOWR control signal.

When this control signal is enabled CPU transfers the data from processor

register to outputdevice(/DATAOUT)
