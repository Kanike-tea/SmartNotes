o Use Case: Social media feeds or messaging apps where availability is more
important than strict consistency.

3. CA (Consistency + Availability)

o Theoretically possible only in non-distributed systems or when there's no
partition.

o Since network failures are inevitable, CA systems cannot be truly partition-
tolerant.

o Example: Traditional relational databases running on a single machine.

In a real-world distributed system, partition tolerance is non-negotiable, which means
system designers are forced to choose between consistency and availability during network
failures.

4. CAP Theorem and NoSQL Systems

Many NoSQL databases are designed around the constraints of the CAP theorem. Since they
aim for high scalability and fault tolerance, they favor partition tolerance (P) and then make
a choice between consistency (C) and availability (A) based on use case:

« AP Systems: Prioritize availability and partition tolerance.

o Return results even during network issues, but data may be eventually
consistent.

o Example: Cassandra, DynamoDB

« CP Systems: Prioritize consistency and partition tolerance.
o May become unavailable to maintain data integrity during partitions.
o Example: HBase, MongoDB (with write concern set for consistency)

Some NoSQL systems offer tunable consistency, allowing developers to adjust the trade-off
depending on the operation.

5. Example Scenario — Applying CAP

Imagine a globally distributed online shopping platform. If the system is partitioned (some
servers can't communicate), you face two choices:

e Consistency (CP): Block access or operations until the system regains consistency.
Customers might see errors or be unable to place orders during this time.
