8:3 Encoder

* an encoder is the octal-to-binary encoder whose truth table is given in Table 4.7

* It has eight inputs (one for each of the octal digits) and three outputs that generate the corresponding
binary number. It is assumed that only one input has a value of | at any given time.

* The encoder can be implemented with OR gates whose inputs are determined directly from the truth
table

* Output z is equal to 1 when the input octal digit is 1, 3,5, or 7.

* Output y is | for octal digits 2,3, 6, or 7, and

* output x is | for digits 4, 5, 6, or 7.
