Implementing a four-input function with a multiplexer

Three-State Gates

A multiplexer can be constructed with three-state gates—digital circuits that exhibit
three states.

Two of the states are signals equivalent to logic 1 and logic O as in a conventional
gate.

The third state is a high-impedance state in which

(1) the logic behaves like an open circuit, which means that the output appears to be
disconnected,

(2) the circuit has no logic significance, and

(3) the circuit connected to the output of the three-state gate is not affected by the
inputs to the gate. Three-state gates may perform any conventional logic, such as
AND or NAND. However, the one most commonly used is the buffer gate.

The graphic symbol for a three-state buffer gate is

Normal input A Output Y= AifC=1
High-impedance if C = 0

Control input C

The buffer has a normal input, an output, and a control input that determines the state of the
output. When the control input is equal to 1, the output is enabled and the gate behaves like
a conventional buffer, with the output equal to the normal input. When the control input is
0, the output is disabled and the gate goes to a high-impedance state, regardless of the value
in the normal input. The high-impedance state of a three-state gate provides a special
