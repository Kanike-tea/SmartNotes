Instruction class Cycles Notes

PLD 1 +1 ifa shifted register offset is used.

QxADD, QxSUB 1 Rd is not available for one cycle.

SMULxy, SMULWx 1 Rd is not available for one cycle.

SMLAxy, SMLAWx 2

SMLALxy 2 RdHi is not available for one cycle.

STC 1

STR/B/H 1 +1 if a preindexed shifted register offset is used.

STRD 1

STM 1 Registers are stored two per cycle once the address is 8-byte aligned. You
cannot write a register in the register list until its value has been stored.
You cannot start another load or store until this one is complete.

SWP/B 2

D.7 INTEL XSCALE INSTRUCTION CYCLE TIMINGS

The Intel XScale is based on a seven-stage pipeline. There is usually a two-cycle delay
following a load instruction before you can use the data. Multiply instructions usually
issue in a fixed number of cycles, but then the result is not available for a variable number
of cycles, depending on the value of Rs. Table D.11 shows how the number of multiply
iteration cycles M depends on the value of Rs. Table D.12 gives the Intel XScale instruction
cycle timings.
