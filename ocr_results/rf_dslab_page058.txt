Recursion, which is basically a function that calls itself based on a terminating condition, makes use of
thestack. Using LIFO, a call to a recursive function saves the return address so that it knows how to return to
thecallingfunction after the call terminates.

11) Whatisastack?

A stack is a data structure in which only the top element can be accessed. As data is stored in the stack,
eachdatais pushed downward, leavingthemost recentlyadded data on top.

12) ExplainBinarySearchTree

A binary search tree stores data in such a way that they can be retrieved very efficiently. The left
subtreecontains nodes whose keys are less than the node’s key value, while the right subtree contains nodes
whosekeysaregreater thanor equal tothenode’s keyvalue. Moreover,bothsubtrees arealso binarysearchtrees.
13) Whatare multidimensionalarrays?

Multidimensional arrays make use of multiple indexes to store data. It is useful when storing data that
cannotbe represented using a single dimensional indexing, such as data representation in a board game, tables
withdatastored in morethanonecolumn.

14) Arelinkedlistsconsideredlinearornon-lineardatastructures?

It actually depends on where you intend to apply linked lists. If you based it on storage, a linked list
isconsidered non-linear. On the other hand, if you based it on access strategies, then a linked list is
consideredlinear.

16) WhatisFIFO?

FIFO is short for First-in, First-out, and is used to represent how data is accessed in a queue. Data has

beeninsertedinto thequeuelist thelongest is the onethat is removed first.

17) Whatisan orderedlist?

An ordered list is a list in which each node’s position in the list is determined by the value of its
keycomponent,so that thekeyvalues forman increasingsequence.asthe list is traversed.

18) Whatis mer gesort?

Merge sort takes a divide-and-conquer approach to sorting data. In a sequence of data, adjacent ones

aremerged and sorted to create bigger sorted lists. These sorted lists are then merged again to form an
evenbiggersorted list, whichcontinuous untilyou haveonesingle sorted list.

19) DifferentiateNULLandVOID.

Null is actually a value, whereas Void is a data type identifier. A variable that is given a Null

valuesimplyindicates anemptyvalue. Void is usedto identifypointers as havingno initial size.
