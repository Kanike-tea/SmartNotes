—The following theorem gives an expression for P(G, A) for a special class of grap

‘Theorem 2. /fagraph G has subgraphs G, and G2 such that G, UG

where \ 7 :
a (A — 1(A — 2) A—n+1)

Proof: Since K, = G; 1 G2 and y(K,) = n, it follows that K, is a subgraph of both Gi and G
and (G ) and y(G2) =n

Given A > n number of different colours, there are 2 UA-1)(A-1)(A-2)...(A=n +1)
