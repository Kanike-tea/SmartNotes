Consider a 32-bit integer (in hex): 0x12345678 which consists of 4 bytes: 12, 34, 56, and 78.
> Hence this integer will occupy 4 bytes in memory.
>» Assume, we store it at memory address starting 1000.
> On little-endian, memory will look like

Address | Value

1000 78
1001 56
1002 34
1003 12

> On big-endian, memory will look like

Address | Value

1000 12
1001 34
1002 56
1003 78

WORD ALIGNMENT
* Words are said to be Aligned in memory if they begin at a byte-address that is a multiple of the
number of bytes in a word.
+ For example,
> If the word length is 16(2 bytes), aligned words begin at byte-addresses 0,2,4.....
> If the word length is 64(2 bytes), aligned words begin at byte-addresses 0,8,16.....
+ Words are said to have Unaligned Addresses, if they begin at an arbitrary byte-address.

ACCESSING NUMBERS, CHARACTERS & CHARACTERS STRINGS

+ A number usually occupies one word. It can be accessed in the memory by specifying its word

address. Similarly, individual characters can be accessed by their byte-address.

+ There are two ways to indicate the length of the string:
1) A special control character with the meaning "end of string" can be used as the last character
in the string.
2) A separate memory word location or register can contain a number indicating the length of
the string in bytes.

MEMORY OPERATIONS
Two memory operations are:
1. Load (Read/Fetch) &
2. Store (Write).
* The Load operation transfers a copy of the contents of a specific memory-location to the processor.
The memory contents remain unchanged.
* Steps for Load operation:
1) Processor sends the address of the desired location to the memory.
2) Processor issues ,,read" signal to memory to fetch the data.
3) Memory reads the data stored at that address.
4) Memory sends the read data to the processor.
