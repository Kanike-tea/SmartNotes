Chapter 6 Basic SQL

refer to the sample database state shown in Figure 5.6 to show the results of some
of these queries. In this section, we present the features of SQL for simple retrieval
queries. Features of SQL for specifying more complex retrieval queries are pre-
sented in Section 7.1.

Before proceeding, we must point out an important distinction between the practical
SQL model and the formal relational model discussed in Chapter 5: SQL allows a
table (relation) to have two or more tuples that are identical in all their attribute
values. Hence, in general, an SQL table is not a set of tuples, because a set does not
allow two identical members; rather, it is a multiset (sometimes called a bag) of
tuples. Some SQL relations are constrained to be sets because a key constraint has
been declared or because the DISTINCT option has been used with the SELECT state-
ment (described later in this section). We should be aware of this distinction as we
discuss the examples.

6.3.1 The SELECT-FROM-WHERE Structure
of Basic SOL Queries

Queries in SQL can be very complex. We will start with simple queries, and then
progress to more complex ones in a step-by-step manner. The basic form of the
SELECT statement, sometimes called a mapping or a select-from-where block, is
formed of the three clauses SELECT, FROM, and WHERE and has the following form:

SELECT <attribute list>
FROM <table list>
WHERE <condition>;

where

= <attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by
the query.
= <table list> is a list of the relation names required to process the query.

= <condition> is a conditional (Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples
to be retrieved by the query.

In SQL, the basic logical comparison operators for comparing attribute values with
one another and with literal constants are =, <, <=, >, >=, and <>. These correspond
to the relational algebra operators =, <, <, >, =, and #, respectively, and to the
C/C++ programming language operators =, <, <=, >, >=, and !=. The main syntactic
difference is the not equal operator. SQL has additional comparison operators that
we will present gradually.

We illustrate the basic SELECT statement in SQL with some sample queries. The
queries are labeled here with the same query numbers used in Chapter 8 for easy
cross-reference.

®The SELECT and FROM clauses are required in all SQL queries. The WHERE is optional (see Sec-
tion 6.3.3).
