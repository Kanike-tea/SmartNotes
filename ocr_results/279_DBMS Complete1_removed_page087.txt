Boyce-Code Normal Form (BCNF)

A relationship is said to be in BCNF if it is already in 3NF and the left hand side of every
dependency is a candidate key. A relation which is in 3NF is almost always in BCNF. These could
be same situation when a 3NF relation may not be in BCNF the following conditions are found true.

1. The candidate keys are composite.

2. There are more than one candidate keys in the relation.
3. There are some common attributes in the relation.

Consider, as an example, the above relation. It is assumed that:
1. A professor can work in more than one department
2. The percentage of the time he spends in each department is given.
3. Each department has only one Head of Department.

The relation diagram for the above relation is given as the following:

Head of
Department Department
Professor Code Percent Time
Department Beadot
Department
Department
Head of Department

Professor Code
Percent Time

The given relation is in 3NF. Observe, however, that the names of Dept. and Head of Dept. are
plicated. Further, if Professor P2 resigns, rows 3 and 4 are deleted. We lose the information that
Rao is the Head of Department of Chemistry.

The normalization of the relation is done by creating a new relation for Dept. and Head of Dept. and
leleting Head of Dept. form the given relation. The normalized relations are shown in the
following.
