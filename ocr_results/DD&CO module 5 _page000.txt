MODULE 5: BASIC PROCESSING UNIT

SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

The processing unit which executes machine instructions and coordinates the
activities of other units of computer is called the Instruction Set Processor (ISP) or
processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU).

The primary function of a processor is to execute the instructions stored in memory.
Instructions are fetched from successive memory locations and executed in
processor, until a branch instruction occurs.

¢ The operation specified by an instruction can be carried out by performing one or
more of the following actions:

1) Read the contents of a given memory-location and load them into a register.

2) Read data from registers or memory location.

3) Perform an arithmetic or logic operation and place the result into a register.

4) Store data from a register into a given memory-location.
¢ The hardware-components needed to perform these actions are shown in Figure 5.1.
