If we compute a” recursively according to formula (4.2) and measure the algo-
rithm’s efficiency by the number of multiplications, we should expect the algorithm
to be in © (log n) because, on each iteration, the size is reduced by about a half at
the expense of one or two multiplications.

A few other examples of decrease-by-a-constant-factor algorithms are given
in Section 4.4 and its exercises. Such algorithms are so efficient, however, that
there are few examples of this kind.

Finally, in the variable-size-decrease variety of decrease-and-conquer, the
size-reduction pattern varies from one iteration of an algorithm to another. Eu-
clid’s algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor provides a good ex-
ample of such a situation. Recall that this algorithm is based on the formula

gced(m, n) = ged(n, m mod n).
