¢ High Efficiency: Enzymes greatly accelerate reaction rates—often by millions of
times compared to uncatalyzed reactions.
¢ Denaturation: Enzymes lose their activity when exposed to extreme temperature,

pH, or chemicals that disrupt their structure.

B. Chemical Properties

¢ Catalytic Power: Enzymes lower the activation energy of reactions without being
consumed.

e Reversibility: Many enzyme-catalyzed reactions are reversible, depending on
reactant and product concentrations.

¢ Temperature Sensitivity: Enzymes have an optimal temperature (usually 35—40°C
in humans) beyond which they become denatured.

¢ pH Sensitivity: Each enzyme has an optimal pH (e.g., pepsin in the stomach works
best at pH ~2, while amylase in saliva works best at pH ~7).

¢ Cofactor Dependence: Some enzymes require cofactors (metal ions like Mg’,
Zn**) or coenzymes (organic molecules like vitamins) for activity.

¢ Inhibition: Enzymes can be inhibited by competitive inhibitors (blocking the active

site) or non-competitive inhibitors (altering enzyme structure).

2. Functions of Enzymes

A. Catalysis of Metabolic Reactions

¢ Enzymes control and regulate all biochemical reactions in cells, such as:
o Digestion: Amylase (breaks down starch), lipase (breaks down fats), protease
(breaks down proteins).

o Energy Production: Enzymes in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and ATP synthesis.

B. DNA Replication & Repair

e« DNA polymerase helps in DNA replication, while DNA ligase helps in DNA repair.

C. Signal Transduction & Cell Communication

e Enzymes like kinases and phosphatases regulate cell signaling pathways by

modifying proteins.
