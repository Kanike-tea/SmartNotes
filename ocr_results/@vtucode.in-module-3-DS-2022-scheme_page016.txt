For any nonempty binary tree, T, if nO is the number of leaf nodes and n2 the number of
nodes of degree 2, then n0 =n2 + 1.
Proof: Let ni be the number of nodes of degree one and n the total number of nodes.
Since all nodes in T are at most of degree two, we have

n=n0 +nl+n2 @
Count the number of branches in a binary tree. If B is the number of branches,

then n =B + 1.

All branches stem from a node of degree one or two. Thus,

B =n 1+ 2n.
Hence, we obtain

n=Bt+l= n1+2n2+1 (2)
Subtracting Eq. (2) from Eq. (1) and rearranging terms, we get

no =n2 +1

Consider the figure:

Here, For Figure (b) n2=4, no= n2+1= 4+1=5 Therefore, the total number of leaf node=5
