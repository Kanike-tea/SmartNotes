Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop

The Hadoop v1 model was the federation model: although HDFS was the storage
layer for the enterprise, processing was a mixture of MapReduce and other engines.
One alternative was to extract data from HDFS store to engines running outside
the cluster in their own silos; such data was moved to graph engines, machine
learning analytical applications, and so forth. The same machines as those used for
the Hadoop cluster were being used for entirely different applications, such as
stream processing outside of Hadoop. This scenario was far from ideal since phys-
ical resources had to be divvied up in a static manner and it was difficult to migrate
and upgrade to new versions when multiple frameworks ran on the same machines.
With YARN, the above issues are addressed. Traditional services are taking advan-
tage of the YARN ResourceManager and are providing their service on the same
Hadoop cluster where the data resides.

Whereas support for SQL in Hadoop was promised by multiple vendors, the actual
support has been less than completely desirable. Some vendors required the HDFS
data to be moved out to another database to run SQL; some required wrappers to
read the HDFS data before an SQL query ran on it. A new trend among RDBMSs
and traditional database systems considers a YARN cluster as a viable platform.
One example is Actian’s analytics platform, which provides SQL in Hadoop* and
which is claimed to be a complete and robust implementation of SQL using the
Actian Vectorwise columnar database (which runs as a YARN application). IBM’s
Big SQL 3.0°! is a project that makes an existing IBM shared-nothing DBMS run
ona YARN cluster.

Apache Storm is a distributed scalable streaming engine that allows users to pro-
cess real-time data feeds. It is widely used by Twitter. Storm on YARN (http://
hortonworks.com/labs/storm/) and SAS on YARN (http://hortonworks.com/
partner/sas/) are applications that treat Storm (a distributed stream processing
application) and SAS (statistical analysis software) as applications on the YARN
platform. As we discussed previously, Giraph and HBase Hoya are ongoing efforts
that are rapidly adopting YARN. A wide range of application systems uses the
Hadoop cluster for storage; examples include services like streaming, machine
learning/statistics, graph processing, OLAP, and key-value stores. These services
go well beyond MapReduce. The goal/promise of YARN is for these services to
coexist on the same cluster and take advantage of the locality of data in HDFS
while YARN orchestrates their use of cluster resources.
