e Deletion depends on the location of the nodes.
e We have three pointers:
o first points to start of the list,

o. trail points to the node the precedes to x.

void delete(listPointer *first, listPointer trail, listPointer x)
{

if (trail)
trail->link=x->link;
else
*first=(*first) ->link;
free (x);
