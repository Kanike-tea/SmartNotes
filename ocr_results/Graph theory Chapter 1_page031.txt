> Let G be a simple graph with n vertices. Suppose all the vertices have different degrees.
Then, since every vertex must have a degree and since all such degrees must be between 0 and
n—1, the degrees must be 0,1,2,3,...,n— 1. Let A be the vertex whose degree is 0 and B be
the vertex whose degree is n — 1. Then n — | edges are incident on B. This means that Bis

Is there a simple graph with 1,1,3,3,3,4,6,7 as the degrees of its vertices?
> Assume that there is such a graph. Since the degrees of vertices are 8 in number, the graph |
should have 8 vertices, say P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, arranged in the order of degrees as given. |

Then, since there are 8 vertices and the vertex W is of degree 7, W should have an edge t0 |
all other vertices. In particular, W must have an edge to both of the vertices P and Q which i
are of degree 1. Then P, Q are not joined to any other vertex and in particular to the vertex |
V which is of degree 6. Since the graph is simple, there cannot be an edge joining V to itself: |
Therefore, V can be joined only to five vertices W, R, S, 7, U. Then V cannot have the degree |
6. This is a contradiction. |

Hence there is no simple graph for which the degrees of vertices are as given. be |
