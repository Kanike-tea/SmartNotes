SELECT <attribute and function list>
FROM <table list>

[ WHERE <condition> ]

[ GROUP BY <grouping attribute(s)> ]
[ HAVING <group condition> ]

[ ORDER BY <attribute list> ];

The SELECT clause lists the attributes or functions to be retrieved. The FROM clause specifies all
relations (tables) needed in the query, including joined relations, but not those in nested queries.
The WHERE clause specifies the conditions for selecting the tuples from these relations, including
join conditions if needed. GROUP BY specifies grouping attributes, whereas HAVING specifies a
condition on the groups being selected rather than on the individual tuples. Finally, ORDER BY
specifies an order for displaying the result of a query.

A query is evaluated conceptually by first applying the FROM clause to identify all tables involved in
the query or to materialize any joined tables followed by the WHERE clause to select and join
tuples, and then by GROUP BY and HAVING. ORDER BY is applied at the end to sort the query
result Each DBMS has special query optimization routines to decide on an execution plan that is
efficient to execute

In general, there are numerous ways to specify the same query in SQL.This flexibility in specifying
queries has advantages and disadvantages.
= The main advantage is that users can choose the technique with which they are most
comfortable when specifying a query. For example, many queries may be specified with join
conditions in the WHERE clause, or by using joined relations in the FROM clause, or with
some form of nested queries and the IN comparison. From the programmer's and the
system’s point of view regarding query optimization, it is generally preferable to write a query
with as little nesting and implied ordering as possible.
= The disadvantage of having numerous ways of specifying the same query is that this may
confuse the user, who may not know which technique to use to specify particular types of
queries. Another problem is that it may be more efficient to execute a query specified in one
way than the same query specified in an alternative way
