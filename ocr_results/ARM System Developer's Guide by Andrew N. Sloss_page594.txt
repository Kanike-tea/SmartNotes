A.3 Alphabetical List of ARM and Thumb Instructions 581

2. CMN<cond> Rn, Rm {, <shift>} ARMV1
3. CMN Ln, Lm THUMBVv1
Action

1. cpsr flags set on the result of (Rn + <rotated_immed>)
2. cpsr flags set on the result of (Rn + <shifted_Rm>)

3. cpsr flags set on the result of (Ln + Lm)

Notes

= In the cpsr: N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>, C = <Unsigned-Overflow>,
V = <SignedOverflow>. These are the same flags as generated by CMP with the second
operand negated.

= If Rnor Rmis pe, then the value used is the address of the instruction plus eight bytes.
Example

MN r0, #3 3 compare r0 with -3
BLT label 3 if (r0<-3) goto label
CMP. Compare two 32-bit integers

1. CMP<cond> Rn, #<rotated_immed> ARMv1
2. (MP<cond> Rn, Rm {, <shift>} ARMv1
3. CMP Ln, #<immed8> THUMBv 1
4. CMP Rn, Rm THUMBv 1
Action
1. cpsr flags set on the result of (Rn - <rotated_immed>)
2. cpsr flags set on the result of (Rn - <shifted_Rm>)
3. cpsr flags set on the result of (Ln - <immed8>)
4. cpsr flags set on the result of (Rn - Rm)
Notes

= In the cpsr: N = <Negative>, Z = <Zero>, C = <NoUnsigned-Overflow>,

V = <SignedOverflow>. The carry flag is set this way because the subtract x — y is
