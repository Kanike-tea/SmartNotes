¢: Generalized Power Series Method or ‘Frobenius Method
Consider a second order DE in the form

ae

p(x eter, xy 4p, (oy=0 ; a. _ -- (1)
where P, (x), P; (x), Py (x) are polynomials in x with Py(x) = 0 at x=0

The method is explained stepwise.

© We assume the series solution of (1) in the form

y=D attr 7 ms on . Q

r=0

where k, ay, 44, 4... are all constants and a,)'# 0

® Then Bay a> a(keryetro}
E r=0 . '
@y . . -2
AF ay" = a (ktr)(k+r-1) #t"
ae y Dy T

r=0

© Wesubstitute these along with y = ¥' & a tT in n(t)¥ which results inan infinite

r=0-
series with various powers of x equal to zero.

© We equate the coefficient of the lowest degree term inx to zero. This will give us
a quadratic equation in k known as the indicial equation. Let ty and k, be the

roots of this equation.

© We need to équate the coefficients of v various other powers of x also to zero. In

general when we equate the coefficient of x** to zero, we obtain a recurrence
relation which helps to determine the constants a), 45, a, a4,...in,terms of % only.

© We substitute the values of a,, 4). yy in the expanded form of (2) given by
y= Pa (ay +0, x40 x°+0,2° + ‘)

© Hence we obtainy = a oF (x) where F (x) isan infinite segs.

© We suppose that k,, ie are real, distinct and do not differ ia an ni ks that is
ky -ky # 0,1,2,3,.
