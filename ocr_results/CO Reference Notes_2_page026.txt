© When exception processing is initiated (as a result of errors), processor.
— suspends program being executed &

— starts an ESR. This routine takes appropriate action to recover from the error.

2. Debugging
¢ Debugger
— is used to find errors in a program and
— uses exceptions to provide 2 important facilities: i) Trace & ii) Breakpoints
i) Trace
> When a processor is operating in trace-mode, an exception occurs after execution of every
instruction (using debugging-program as ESR).
Debugging-program enables user to examine contents of registers, memory-locations and so on.
On return from debugging-program,

next instruction in program being debugged is executed, then debugging-program is activated again.
The trace exception is disabled during the execution of the debugging-program.

ii) Breakpoints
> Here, the program being debugged is interrupted only at specific points selected by user.
> An instruction called Trap (or Software interrupt) is usually provided for this purpose.
> When program is executed & reaches breakpoint, the user can examine memory & register contents.

3. Privilege Exception
> To protect OS from being corrupted by user-programs, Privileged Instructions are executed only while
processor is in supervisor-mode.
» For e.g.
> When processor runs in user-mode, it will not execute instruction that change priority of processor.
> An attempt to execute privileged-instruction will produce a Privilege Exception.
> As a result, processor switches to supervisor-mode & begins to execute an appropriate routine in OS.

DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS (DMA)
¢ The transfer of a block of data directly b/w an external device & main-memory w/o
continuous involvement by processor is called DMA.
¢ DMA controller
— is a control circuit that performs DMA transfers (Figure 8.13).
— is a part of the I/O device interface.
— performs the functions that would normally be carried out by processor.
¢ While a DMA transfer is taking place, the processor can be used to execute another program.
