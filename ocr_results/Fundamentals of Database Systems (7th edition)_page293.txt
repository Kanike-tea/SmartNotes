A two-level recursive

query.

operation R * S, only tuples from R that have matching tuples in S—and vice
versa—appear in the result. Hence, tuples without a matching (or related) tuple
are eliminated from the JOIN result. Tuples with NULL values in the join attri-
butes are also eliminated. This type of join, where tuples with no match are elim-
inated, is known as an inner join. The join operations we described earlier in
Section 8.3 are all inner joins. This amounts to the loss of information if the user
wants the result of the JOIN to include all the tuples in one or more of the com-
ponent relations.

A set of operations, called outer joins, were developed for the case where the user
wants to keep all the tuples in R, or all those in S, or all those in both relations in
the result of the JOIN, regardless of whether or not they have matching tuples in
the other relation. This satisfies the need of queries in which tuples from two
tables are to be combined by matching corresponding rows, but without losing
any tuples for lack of matching values. For example, suppose that we want a list of
all employee names as well as the name of the departments they manage if they
happen to manage a department; if they do not manage one, we can indicate it
