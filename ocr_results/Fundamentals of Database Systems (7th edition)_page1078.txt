State of Florida University System, or a compilation of multiple external resources
on the World Wide Web, such as Google Scholar or the IEEE/ACM index. These
interfaces provide universal access to different types of content—such as books,
articles, audio, and video—situated in different database systems and remote repos-
itories. Similar to real libraries, these digital collections are maintained via a catalog
and organized in categories for online reference. Digital libraries “include personal,
distributed, and centralized collections such as online public-access catalogs
(OPACs) and bibliographic databases, distributed document databases, scholarly
and professional discussion lists and electronic journals, other online databases,
forums, and bulletin boards.”*”

27.7.1 Web Analysis and Its Relationship
to Information Retrieval

In addition to browsing and searching the Web, another important activity closely
related to information retrieval is to analyze or mine information on the Web for
new information of interest. (We discuss mining of data from files and databases
in Chapter 28.) Application of data analysis techniques for discovery and analysis
of useful information from the Web is known as Web analysis. Over the past few
years, the World Wide Web has emerged as an important repository of informa-
tion for many day-to-day applications for individual consumers, as well as a sig-
nificant platform for e-commerce and for social networking. These properties
make it an interesting target for data analysis applications. The Web mining and
analysis field is an integration of a wide range of fields spanning information
retrieval, text analysis, natural language processing, data mining, machine learn-
ing, and statistical analysis.

The goals of Web analysis are to improve and personalize search results relevance
and to identify trends that may be of value to various businesses and organizations.
We elaborate on these goals next.

= Finding relevant information. People usually search for specific informa-
tion on the Web by entering keywords in a search engine or browsing infor-
mation portals and using services. Search services are heavily constrained by
search relevance problems since search engines must map and approximate
the information need of millions of users as an a priori task. Low precision
(see Section 27.6) ensues due to results that are nonrelevant to the user. In
the case of the Web, high recall (see Section 27.6) is impossible to determine
due to the inability to index all the pages on the Web. Also, measuring recall
does not make sense since the user is concerned with only the top few docu-
ments. The most relevant results for the user are typically from only the top
few results.

= Personalization of the information. Different people have different con-
tent and presentation preferences. Various customization tools used in
