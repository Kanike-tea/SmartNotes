EXCEPT ( SELECT Pno

WHERE Ssn=Essn) );

UNIQUE Functions
UNIQUE(Q) returns TRUE if there are no duplicate tuples in the result of query Q; otherwise, it
returns FALSE. This can be used to test whether the result of a nested query is a set or a multiset.

1.1.5 Explicit Sets and Renaming of Attributes in SQL
IN SQL it is possible to use an explicit set of values in the WHERE clause, rather than a nested
query. Such a set is enclosed in parentheses.
Example: Retrieve the Social Security numbers of all employees who work on project numbers 1, 2,
or 3.

SELECT DISTINCT Essn

FROM WORKS_ON

WHERE Pno IN (1, 2, 3);
In SQL, it is possible to rename any attribute that appears in the result of a query by adding the
qualifier AS followed by the desired new name
Example: Retrieve the last name of each employee and his or her supervisor

SELECT E.Lname AS Employee_name,

S.Lname AS Supervisor_name

FROM EMPLOYEE AS E,

EMPLOYEE AS S

WHERE E.Super_ssn=S.Ssn;
