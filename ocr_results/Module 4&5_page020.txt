Microcontrollers - BCS402

e Hardware Abstraction Layer called «HAL (pronounced micro-HAL)

e Debug monitor called Angel.

HHAL provides a low-level device driver framework that allows it to operate over different

communication devices
HHAL supports these main features:

e System initialization — setting up the target platform and processor core. Depending
upon the complexity of the target platform, this can either be a simple or complicated
task.

e  Polled serial driver — used to provide a basic method of communication with a host.

e LED support—allows control over the LEDs for simple user feedback. This provides an
application the ability to display operational status.

e Timer support—allows a periodic interrupt to be set up. This is essential for preemptive
context switching operating systems that require this mechanism.

e Interrupt controllers—support for different interrupt controllers.

The second technology, Angel, allows communication between a host debugger and a target
platform. It allows you to inspect and modify memory, download and execute images, set
breakpoints, and display processor register contents. All this control is through the host
debugger. The Angel debug monitor must have access to the SWI and IRQ or FIQ vectors.

Angel uses SWI instructions to provide a set of APIs that allow a program to open, read, and
write to a host filing system. IRQ/FIQ interrupts are used for communication purposes with the

host debugger.

3.3 Red Hat RedBoot

RedBoot is a firmware tool developed by Red Hat. RedBoot is designed to execute on different
CPUs. It provides both debug capability through GNU Debugger (GDB), as well as a bootloader.

The RedBoot software core is based on a HAL. RedBoot supports these main features:
