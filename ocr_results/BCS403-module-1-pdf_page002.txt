An Example

grades in a university environment. The database is organized as five files, each of which stores
data records of the same type.

1. STUDENT file: stores data on each student.

2. COURSE file: stores data on each course.

3. SECTION file: stores data on each section of a course.

4. GRADE_REPORT file: stores the grades that students receive in the various sections they

have completed.

5. PREREQUISITE file :stores the prerequisites of each course.
