Preface xiii

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

First, of course, are our wives—Shau Chin Symes and Yulian Yang—and families who have
been very supportive and have put up with us spending a large proportion of our home
time on this project.

This book has taken many years to complete, and many people have contributed with
encouragement and technical advice. We would like to personally thank all the people
involved. Writing a technical book involves a lot of painstaking attention to detail, so a big
thank you to all the reviewers who spent time and effort reading and providing feedback—a
difficult activity that requires a special skill. Reviewers who worked with the publisher during
the developmental process were Jim Turley (Silicon-Insider), Peter Maloy (CodeSprite),
Chris Larsen, Peter Harrod (ARM, Ltd.), Gary Thomas (MLB Associates), Wayne Wolf
(Princeton University), Scott Runner (Qualcomm, Inc.), Niall Murphy (PanelSoft), and
Dominic Sweetman (Algorithmics, Ltd.).

A special thanks to Wilco Dijkstra, Edward Nevill, and David Seal for allowing us to
include selected examples within the book. Thanks also to Rod Crawford, Andrew Cum-
mins, Dave Flynn, Jamie Smith, William Rees, and Anne Rooney for helping throughout
with advice. Thanks to the ARM Strategic Support Group—Howard Ho, John Archibald,
Miguel Echavarria, Robert Allen, and Ian Field—for reading and providing quick local
feedback.

We would like to thank John Rayfield for initiating this project and contributing
Chapter 15. We would also like to thank David Brash for reviewing the manuscript and
allowing us to include ARMvé6 material in this book.

Lastly, we wish to thank Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, especially Denise Penrose and
Belinda Breyer for their patience and advice throughout the project.
