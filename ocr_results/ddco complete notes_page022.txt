> The AND-OR implementation is shown in Fig. 3.20(a). There are four
levels of gating in the circuit. The first level has two AND gates. The
second level has an OR gate followed by an AND gate in the third level
and an OR gate in the fourth level.

> A logic diagram with a pattern of alternating levels of AND and OR gates
can easily be converted into a NAND circuit with the use of mixed
notation, shown in Fig. 3.20(b).

> The procedure is to change every AND gate to an AND-invert graphic
symbol and every OR gate to an invert-OR graphic symbol. The NAND
circuit performs the same logic as the AND-OR diagram as long as there
are two bubbles along the same line.

> The bubble associated with input B causes an extra comple- mentation,
which must be compensated for by changing the input literal to B'.

The general procedure for converting a multilevel AND-OR diagram into an all-NAND
diagram using mixed notation is as follows:

1. Convert all AND gates to NAND gates with AND-invert graphic symbols.
2. Convert all OR gates to NAND gates with invert-OR graphic symbols.
3. Check all the bubbles in the diagram. For every bubble that is not

compensated by another small circle along the same line, insert an inverter (a one-
input NAND gate) or complement the input literal.

As another example, consider the multilevel Boolean function
