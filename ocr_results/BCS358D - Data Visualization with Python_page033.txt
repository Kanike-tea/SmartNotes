LAB PROGRAM 01 (b)

1 b) Develop a Python program to check whether a given number is palindrome or not and

also count the number of occurrences of each digit in the input number.

Aim: Introduce the Python fundamentals, data types, operators, flow control and exception

handling in Python

PROGRAM EXPLANATION
The below program takes a number as input and performs various operations on it. Let's go

through the program step by step:

1.

10.

The program prompts the user to enter a number using the input() function, and the
entered number is stored in the variable num.
The program creates a variable temp and assigns it the value of num. This is done to

preserve the original value of the number for later comparisons.

. The program converts temp to a string n using the str() function. This allows us to

perform string operations on the number.

. The program initializes a variable rev to 0, which will be used to store the reversed

version of the number.

. Using a while loop, the program extracts the rightmost digit of the number using the

modulo operator (%). It then multiplies rev by 10 and adds the extracted digit to it. This

effectively builds the reversed number digit by digit.

. Inside the loop, the program divides num by 10 (integer division) to remove the rightmost

digit, and the loop continues until num becomes 0.

. Once the loop finishes, the program prints the original number (temp) and the reversed

number (rev).

. The program checks if the original number (temp) is equal to the reversed number (rev).

If they are equal, it prints a message indicating that the number is a palindrome.
Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the number is not a palindrome.

The program uses the len() function to find the number of digits in the original number
by converting it to a string (str(n)) and then taking the length of the string. It prints this

value.

The program initializes an empty dictionary s to store the occurrences of each digit in the

number.
