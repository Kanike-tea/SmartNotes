2. Complete Binary Tree
A binary tree T is said to complete if all its levels, except possibly the last level, have the

maximum number node 2i, i>0 and if all the nodes at the last level appears as far left as
ossible.

3.Full Binary Tree
A full binary tree of depth ‘k’ is a binary tree of depth k having 2k _ 1 nodes, k > 1.

4, Extended Binary Trees or 2-trees

An extended binary tree is a transformation of any binary tree into a complete binary tree.
This transformation consists of replacing every null subtree of the original tree with
“special nodes.” The nodes from the original tree are then internal nodes, while the
special nodes are external nodes.

For instance, consider the following binary tree.
