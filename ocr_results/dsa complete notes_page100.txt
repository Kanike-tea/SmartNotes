ThreadNode * temp = tree;

Analysis: The computing time for tinorder is still O(n)

Binary Search Trees

ADT Dictionary

objects: a collection of n> 0 pairs, each pair has a key and an associated item
functions: for all d € Dictionary, item € Item, k € Key, n € integer

DictionaryCreate(max_size) ::= | create an empty Dictionary

Boolean IsEmpty(d, n) :

if (n>0O) return TRUE else return FALSE

Element Search(d, k) ::=

return item with key k,
return NULL if no such element.

Element Delete(d, k) ::=

delete and return item (if any) with key k;

void Insert(d,item,k) :

insert item with key k into d.

Definition Binary search tree

A binary search tree is a binary tree. It may be empty. If it is not empty then it satisfies the following

properties:

1) Each node has exactly one key and the keys in the tree are distinct.

2) The keys (if any) in the left subtree are smaller than the key in the root.
3) The keys (if any) in the right subtree are larger than the key in the root.
4) The left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.

5) The root has a key.

Binary search Tree

To search for a node whose key is k. We begin at the root of the binary search tree.
