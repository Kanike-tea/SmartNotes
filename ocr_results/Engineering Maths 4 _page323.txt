The integral in the RHS of this equation cannot be evaluated by known methods of
integration and we have to employ the technique of numerical integration which
becomes tedious. Hence we think of standardization and the same is as follows.

Let z, = a and 2 =

x = b. The integral in (1) assumes the following form.

If F(z) = = e7” (standard normal: probability density function), it may be
observed that this is same as the pdf of the normal disttibution with Ht = 0 and
0 = 1. Thus we can say that the normal probability density function with w = 0 and

is called the standard

normal variate (S.N.V) and F(z) is called the standard normal curve which is symmetrical
about the line z = 0. The curve is as follows, - . 3
