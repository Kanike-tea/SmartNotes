return NULL if no such element.

void Insert(d,item,k) ::= insert item with key k into d.

Definition Binary search tree
A binary search tree is a binary tree. It may be empty. If it is not empty then it satisfies the following
properties:
1) Each node has exactly one key and the keys in the tree are distinct.
2) The keys (if any) in the left subtree are smaller than the key in the root.
3) The keys (if any) in the right subtree are larger than the key in the root.
4) The left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
5) The root has a key.
Example:

Binary search Tree
Searching a Binary Search Tree

To search for a node whose key is k. We begin at the root of the binary search tree.
e Ifthe root is NULL, the search tree contains no nodes and the search is unsuccessful.
* we compare k with the key in root. If k equals the root's key, then the search terminates
successfully.
e Ifkis less than root's key, then, we search the left subtree of the root.
e Ifkis larger than root's key value, we search the right subtree of the root.
