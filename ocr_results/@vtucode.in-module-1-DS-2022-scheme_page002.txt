DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

Primitive Data Structures

These are basic data structures and are directly operated upon by the machine instructions.
These data types consists of characters that cannot be divided and hence they also called
simple data types.

Example: Integers, Floating Point Numbers, Characters and Pointers etc.

Non-Primitive Data Structures

These are derived from the primitive data structures. The non-primitive data structures

emphasizeon structuring of a group of homogeneous or heterogeneous data items.

Example: Arrays, Lists and Files, Graphs, trees etc.

Based on the structure and arrangement of data, non-primitive data structures is
furtherclassified into

1. Linear Data Structure

2. Non-linear Data Structure

1. Linear Data Structure:

A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear list. There are
basically two ways of representing such linear structure in memory.

1. One way is to have the linear relationships between the elements represented by means of
sequential memory location. These linear structures are called arrays.

2. The other way is to have the linear relationship between the elements represented by means
of pointers or links. These linear structures are called linked lists.

The common examples of linear data structure are Arrays, Queues, Stacks, Linked lists

2. Non-linear Data Structure:

A data structure is said to be non-linear if the data are not arranged in sequence or a linear.
The insertion and deletion of data is not possible in linear fashion. This structure is mainly
used to represent data containing a hierarchical relationship between elements. Trees and

graphs are the examples of non-linear data structure.

OPERATIONS ON DATA STRUCTURES

The commonly used operations on data structures are as follows,
1. Create: The Create operation results in reserving memory for the program elements.
The creation of data structures may take place either during compile time or during

run time.
