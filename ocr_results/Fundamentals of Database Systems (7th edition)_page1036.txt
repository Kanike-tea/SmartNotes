the predicates in the body of the rule by that interpretation. Hence, whenever a
particular substitution (binding) to the variables in the rules is applied, if all the
predicates in the body of a rule are true under the interpretation, the predicate in
the head of the rule must also be true. The interpretation shown in Figure 26.13 is a
model for the two rules shown, since it can never cause the rules to be violated.
Notice that a rule is violated if a particular binding of constants to the variables
makes all the predicates in the rule body true but makes the predicate in the rule
head false. For example, if SUPERVISE(a, b) and SUPERIOR(}, c) are both true under
some interpretation, but SUPERIOR(a, c) is not true, the interpretation cannot be a
model for the recursive rule:

SUPERIOR(X, Y) :- SUPERVISE(X, Z), SUPERIOR(Z, Y)

In the model-theoretic approach, the meaning of the rules is established by provid-
ing a model for these rules. A model is called a minimal model for a set of rules if
we cannot change any fact from true to false and still get a model for these rules. For
