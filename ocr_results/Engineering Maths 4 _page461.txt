Probbability distributions
+ — Probability function p(x)
If p(x;) 20 and Y p(a;) =1 then p(x) isa probability. function. The set of
i
values [x;, p(3;)] iscalled a discrete probability distribution of the discrete random
variable X.
P(X) is the probability density function. (p-4-f)
f(x) = P(X< x) = ¥ p(x;) iscalled the cumulative distribution function ,
