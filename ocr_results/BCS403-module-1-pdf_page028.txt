Figure2.5.2(b) : Physical two-tier client/server architecture.
The concept of client/server architecture assumes an underlying framework that consists of many
PCs and workstations as well as a smaller number of mainframe machines, connected via LANs
and other types of computer networks. A client is a user machine that provides user interface
capabilities and local processing. When a client requires access to additional functionality such as
database access—that does not exist at that machine, it connects to a server that provides the
needed functionality. A server is a system containing both hardware and software that can provide

services to the client machines, such as file access, printing, archiving, or database access.
