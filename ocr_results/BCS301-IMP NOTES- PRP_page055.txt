Simple Sampling:

Simple sampling is a special case of random sampling in which each event has same probability of
success or failure.

Hypothesis:
A hypothesis is an assumption based on insubstantial evidences that lends itself to further testing and

experimentation. For example a farmer claims significant increase in crop production after using a particular
fertilizer and after a season of experimenting, his hypothesis may be proved true or false. Any hypothesis may
be accepted or rejected as per specific confidence levels and must be admissible to refutation.

Null Hypothe
The null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two

measured phenomena or no association among groups.
Example: Given the test scores of two random samples, one of men and one of women, does one group differ from
the other? A possible null hypothesis is that the mean male score is the same as the mean female score:
Ho: fa = 2
where
Ho = the null hypothesis,
/4 = the mean of population 1, and
#2 = the mean of population 2.
A stronger null hypothesis is that the two samples are drawn from the same population, such that the
variances and shapes of the distributions are also equal.

Alternative Hypothesis:
It is the opposite statement of null hypothesis and denoted by Hy: “, 4 My

Significance levels (a):

The significance level of an event (such as a statistical test) is the probability that the
event could have occurred by chance. If the level is quite low, that is, the probability of occurring by chance is
quite small, we say the event is significant y,

The level of significance is the measurement of the statistical significance. It defines whether the null
hypothesis is assumed to be accepted or rejected. It is expected to identify if the result is statistically significant
for the null hypothesis to be false or rejected.

a=5% a=1% a=0.27%
Example: A level of significance of p=0.05 means that there is a 95% probability that the results found in the

study are the result of a true relationship/difference between groups being compared. It also means that there
is a 5% chance that the results were found by chance alone and no true relationship exists between groups.

Standard Error:
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic is Known as Standard Error (S.E.).

Pr ion:
Reciprocal of standard error is known as precision.

Confidence Limits:
In short, confidence limits show how accurate an estimation of the mean is or is likely to be. Confidence limits
are the lowest and the highest numbers at the end of a confidence interval.

Confidence Interval:

A confidence interval is a range around a measurement that conveys how precise the measurement is. A
confidence interval, in statistics, refers to the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of
values for a certain proportion of times. Analysts often use confidence intervals that contain either 95% or 99% of
expected observations.

Critical Value:
A critical value is the value of the test statistic which defines the upper and lower bounds of a confidence interval,
or which defines the threshold of statistical significance in a statistical test.
