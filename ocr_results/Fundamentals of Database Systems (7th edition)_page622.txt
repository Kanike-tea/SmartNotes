Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures

become a commercial product until Seagate adopted OSDs in its Kinetic Open
Storage Platform. Currently, Facebook uses an object storage system to store pho-
tos at the level of over 350 Petabytes of storage; Spotify uses an object storage sys-
tem for storing songs; and Dropbox uses it for its storage infrastructure. Object
storage is the choice of many cloud offerings, such as Amazon’s AWS (Amazon
Web Service) $3, and Microsoft's Azure, which stores files, relations, messages, and
so on as objects. Other examples of products include Hitachi's HCP, EMC’s Atmos,
and Scality’s RING. Openstack Swift is an open source project that allows one to
use HTTP GET and PUT to retrieve and store objects—that’s basically the whole
API. Openstack Swift uses very cheap hardware, is fully fault resistant, automati-
cally takes advantage of geographic redundancy, and scales to very large numbers of
objects. Since object storage forces locking to occur at the object level, it is not
clear how suitable it is for concurrent transaction processing in high-throughput
transaction-oriented systems. Therefore, it is still not considered viable for main-
stream enterprise-level database applications.

16.12 Summary

We began this chapter by discussing the characteristics of memory hierarchies and
then concentrated on secondary storage devices. In particular, we focused on mag-
netic disks because they are still the preferred medium to store online database files.
Table 16.1 presented a perspective on the memory hierarchies and their current
capacities, access speeds, transfer rates, and costs.

Data on disk is stored in blocks; accessing a disk block is expensive because of the
seek time, rotational delay, and block transfer time. To reduce the average block
access time, double buffering can be used when accessing consecutive disk blocks.
(Other disk parameters are discussed in Appendix B.) We introduced the various
interface technologies in use today for disk drives and optical devices. We presented
a list of strategies employed to improve access of data from disks. We also intro-
duced solid-state drives, which are rapidly becoming popular, and optical drives,
which are mainly used as tertiary storage. We discussed the working of the buffer
manager, which is responsible for handling data requests and we presented various
buffer replacement policies. We presented different ways of storing file records on
disk. File records are grouped into disk blocks and can be fixed length or variable
length, spanned or unspanned, and of the same record type or mixed types. We dis-
cussed the file header, which describes the record formats and keeps track of the disk
addresses of the file blocks. Information in the file header is used by system software
accessing the file records.

Then we presented a set of typical commands for accessing individual file records
and discussed the concept of the current record of a file. We discussed how com-
plex record search conditions are transformed into simple search conditions that
are used to locate records in the file.

Three primary file organizations were then discussed: unordered, ordered, and
hashed. Unordered files require a linear search to locate records, but record
