P shortest Path

The shortest path arboresence formed by these arcs is shown below:

Figure 4.54

From the above Figure, we note that the following are the shortest paths Gud their weighs)
from vertex 1 to all other vertices:

(1) Path from 1 to 2: 1 — 2; weight 4.
(2) Path from 1 to 3 : 1 + 2 — 3; weight 5.
(3) Path from 1 to 4: 1 2 — 3’ 4; weight’7.

(4) Path from 1 to5: 1 > 233 > 6 — S; weight 10.

(5) Path from 1 to 6: 1 > 2 > 3 — 6; weight 9.

(6) Path from 1 107: 13 2 3 6 > 5 — 7; weight 16. .

Example 2| Apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to the weighted digraph shown in Figure 4. 55 in or-

dtr 10 find the shortest @istance from the vertex c to each of the other v vertices.
