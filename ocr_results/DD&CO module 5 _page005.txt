Input & Output Gating for one Register Bit
¢A 2-input multiplexer is used to select the data applied to the input of an edge-
triggered D flip-flop.
. Riin=1 0 mux selects data on bus. This data will be loaded into flip-flop at rising-edge
of clock. Riin=0 4 mux feeds back the value currently stored in flip-flop (Figure 7.3).
. Q output of flip-flop is connected to bus via a tri-state gate. Riout=0 1 gate's output is
in the high-impedance state.
Riout=1 [1 the gate drives the bus to 0 or 1, depending on the value of Q
