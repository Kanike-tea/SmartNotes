1004 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

It can be shown that any formula can be converted into clausal form. For our pur-
poses, we are mainly interested in the form of the individual clauses, each of which
is a disjunction of literals. Recall that literals can be positive literals or negative liter-
als. Consider a clause of the form:

NOT(P,) OR NOT(P3) OR ... OR NOT(P,,) OR Q; OR Q; OR... OR Quy ()

This clause has n negative literals and m positive literals. Such a clause can be trans-
formed into the following equivalent logical formula:

P, AND P; AND ... AND P,, = Q, OR Q; OR... OR Q,, (2)

where = is the implies symbol. The formulas (1) and (2) are equivalent, meaning
that their truth values are always the same. This is the case because if all the P;

literals (i = 1, 2, ... , n) are true, the formula (2) is true only if at least one of the
Qs is true, which is the meaning of the > (implies) symbol. For formula (1), ifall
the P; literals (i = 1, 2, ... , n) are true, their negations are all false; so in this case

formula (1) is true only if at least one of the Q;’s is true. In Datalog, rules are
expressed as a restricted form of clauses called Horn clauses, in which a clause
can contain at most one positive literal. Hence, a Horn clause is either of the form

NOT (P,) OR NOT(P2) OR ... OR NOT(P,,) OR Q (3)
or of the form

NOT (P,) OR NOT(P3) OR ... ORNOT(P,,) (4)
The Horn clause in (3) can be transformed into the clause

P, AND P; AND ... AND P,, > Q (5)
which is written in Datalog as the following rule:

Qe Pyy Pay ves Pre (6)
The Horn clause in (4) can be transformed into

P, AND P AND ... AND P,, > (7)
which is written in Datalog as follows:

Py, Py... Pye (8)

A Datalog rule, as in (6), is hence a Horn clause, and its meaning, based on form-
ula (5), is that if the predicates P; AND P) AND ... AND P,, are all true for a particular
binding to their variable arguments, then Q is also true and can hence be inferred.
The Datalog expression (8) can be considered as an integrity constraint, where all
the predicates must be true to satisfy the query.

In general, a query in Datalog consists of two components:

= A Datalog program, which is a finite set of rules
= A literal P(X), Xo, ... ,X,), where each X; is a variable or a constant

A Prolog or Datalog system has an internal inference engine that can be used to
process and compute the results of such queries. Prolog inference engines typically
