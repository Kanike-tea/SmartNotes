Thus we have pT2Sh ; of=3 and ‘6/1 = 7 3

Case - (ii) Random sample of size 2 without replacement.

Wehave 3, = 3 samples. The three samples are (1,2), (2,3), (3,1):
2

The associated means are 1.5, 2.5, 2. Further we have,

15+25+2

Variance =-02 = = {(15-2)°+(25-27+(2-2) Las = 5

Here we note that Hy =H=2

Note : Suppose N is large say 500 and n is small say 5 then the correction factor (C) becomes

N=-n 500-5 495 _
“N=1~ 500-1 ~ 49g = 9872 ™ EO

5.14] Testing of Hypothesis ; . .
In order to arrive at a decision regarding the population throu;
population we have to make certain assumption referred to as hypothesis which may
or may not be true, Much depends on the framing of hypothesis. "

The hypothesis formulated for the purpose of its rejection und
it is true is called the Null Hypothesis denoted by Hy :

Any hypothesis which is complimentary to the null hypothesis is called Alternative
Hypothesis denoted by Ay. :
