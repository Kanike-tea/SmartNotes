Database Management System [BCS403]

1.3. Update Operations, Transactions, and Dealing with Constraint Violations
The operations of the relational model can be categorized into retrievals and updates
There are three basic operations that can change the states of relations in the database:
1. Insert - used to insert one or more new tuples in a relation
2. Delete- used to delete tuples
3. Update (or Modify)- used to change the values of some attributes in existing tuples
Whenever these operations are applied, the integrity constraints specified on the relational database

schema should not be violated.

1.3.1 The Insert Operation
The Insert operation provides a list of attribute values for a new tuple ¢ that is to be inserted into a

elation R. Insert can violate any of the four types of constraints

1. Domain constraints : if an attribute value is given that does not appear in the corresponding
domain or is not of the appropriate data type

2. Key constraints : if a key value in the new tuple ¢ already exists in another tuple in the
relation r(R)

3. Entity integrity: if any part of the primary key of the new tuple t is NULL

4. Referential integrity : ifthe value of any foreign key in ¢ refers to a tuple that does not exist

in the referenced relation

Examples:
1. Operation:
Insert <‘Cecilia’, “F’y ‘Kolonsky’, NULL, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’,
F, 28000, NULL, 4>
Result: This insertion violates the entity integrity constraint (NULL for the primary key
Ssn), so it is rejected
2. Operation:
Insert <‘Alicia’, ‘J’, ‘Zelaya’, ‘999887777’, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’,
F, 28000, ‘987654321’, 4>
Result: This insertion violates the key constraint because another tuple with the same Ssn
value already exists in the EMPLOYEE relation, and so it is rejected.
3.Operation:
Insert <‘Cecilia’, ‘F’, ‘Kolonsky’, ‘677678989’, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windswept, Katy,
TX’, F, 28000, ‘987654321’, 7>
