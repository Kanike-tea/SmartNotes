Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

step is called conceptual design. The conceptual schema is a concise description of
the data requirements of the users and includes detailed descriptions of the entity
types, relationships, and constraints; these are expressed using the concepts pro-
vided by the high-level data model. Because these concepts do not include imple-
mentation details, they are usually easier to understand and can be used to
communicate with nontechnical users. The high-level conceptual schema can also
be used as a reference to ensure that all users’ data requirements are met and that
the requirements do not conflict. This approach enables database designers to con-
centrate on specifying the properties of the data, without being concerned with
storage and implementation details, which makes it is easier to create a good con-
ceptual database design.

During or after the conceptual schema design, the basic data model operations can
be used to specify the high-level user queries and operations identified during
functional analysis. This also serves to confirm that the conceptual schema meets
all the identified functional requirements. Modifications to the conceptual schema
can be introduced if some functional requirements cannot be specified using the
initial schema.

The next step in database design is the actual implementation of the database, using
a commercial DBMS. Most current commercial DBMSs use an implementation
data model—such as the relational (SQL) model—so the conceptual schema is
transformed from the high-level data model into the implementation data model.
This step is called logical design or data model mapping; its result is a database
schema in the implementation data model of the DBMS. Data model mapping is
often automated or semiautomated within the database design tools.

The last step is the physical design phase, during which the internal storage struc-
tures, file organizations, indexes, access paths, and physical design parameters for
the database files are specified. In parallel with these activities, application pro-
grams are designed and implemented as database transactions corresponding to the
high-level transaction specifications.

We present only the basic ER model concepts for conceptual schema design in this
chapter. Additional modeling concepts are discussed in Chapter 4, when we intro-
duce the EER model.

3.2 A Sample Database Application

In this section we describe a sample database application, called COMPANY, which
serves to illustrate the basic ER model concepts and their use in schema design. We
list the data requirements for the database here, and then create its conceptual
schema step-by-step as we introduce the modeling concepts of the ER model. The
COMPANY database keeps track of a company’s employees, departments, and
projects. Suppose that after the requirements collection and analysis phase, the
database designers provide the following description of the miniworld—the part of
the company that will be represented in the database.
