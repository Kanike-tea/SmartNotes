Lab Manual BCS358D-Data Visualization with Python Laboratory

7. Create a legend: This code creates a legend using Legend and LegendItem objects. It
associates each legend item with a specific renderer (in this case, the line objects line1
and “line2) and assigns labels for the legend items.

8. Finally, show the plot in a web browser: The show function displays the Bokeh plot in a
web browser, and you can interact with the plot, including zooming and panning, as well
as seeing the legend and annotation. The plot is also saved in the HTML file specified

earlier using output_file.
PROGRAM

from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show
from bokeh.models import Legend, LegendItem, Title, Span

# Output to an HTML file
output_file("line_graph_with_annotations.html")

# Sample data

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
yl = (2, 5, 7, 2, 8]
y2 = (1, 4, 5, 3, 6]

# Create a Bokeh figure
p = figure(title="Line Graph with Annotations and Legends",
x_axis_label='X-axis', y_axis_label='Y-axis')

# Add lines to the figure

linel = p.line(x, yl, line_width=2, color="blue", legend_label="Line
i")

line2 = p.line(x, y2, line_width=2, color="red", legend_label="Line
2")

# Add annotations (vertical line and a text label)
annotation = Span(location=3, dimension='width', line_color='black',
line_width=8)

# Add the annotation to the figure
p.add_layout (annotation)

# Create a legend

legend = Legend (items=[
LegendItem(label="Line 1", renderers=[linel]),
LegendItem(label="Line 2", renderers=[line2]),

])
