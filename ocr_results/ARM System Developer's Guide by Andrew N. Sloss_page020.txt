Figure 1.2 An example of an ARM-based embedded device, a microcontroller.

Figure 1.2 shows a typical embedded device based on an ARM core. Each box represents
a feature or function. The lines connecting the boxes are the buses carrying data. We can
separate the device into four main hardware components:

= The ARM processor controls the embedded device. Different versions of the ARM pro-
cessor are available to suit the desired operating characteristics. An ARM processor
comprises a core (the execution engine that processes instructions and manipulates
data) plus the surrounding components that interface it with a bus. These components
can include memory management and caches.

= Controllers coordinate important functional blocks of the system. Two commonly
found controllers are interrupt and memory controllers.

= The peripherals provide all the input-output capability external to the chip and are
responsible for the uniqueness of the embedded device.

= A busis used to communicate between different parts of the device.
