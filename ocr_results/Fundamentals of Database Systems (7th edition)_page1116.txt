Algorithm 28.3. Algorithm for Decision Tree Induction

Input: Set of training data records: Rj, Ro, ... , R,, and set of attributes: Aj,
Ay 5 An

Output: Decision tree

procedure Build_tree (records, attributes);
Begin
create a node N;
if all records belong to the same class C, then
return N as a leaf node with class label C;
if attributes is empty then
return N as a leaf node with class label C, such that the majority of
records belong to it;
select attribute A; (with the highest information gain) from attributes;
label node N with Aj
for each known value, vj of Aj do
begin
add a branch from node N for the condition A;
Sj = subset of records where A; = vp
if S| is empty then
add a leaf, L, with class label C, such that the majority of
records belong to it and return L
else add the node returned by Build_tree(S;, attributes — A;);
end;

Before we illustrate Algorithm 28.3, we will explain the information gain measure
in more detail. The use of entropy as the information gain measure is motivated by
the goal of minimizing the information needed to classify the sample data in the
resulting partitions and thus minimizing the expected number of conditional tests
needed to classify a new record. The expected information needed to classify train-
ing data of s samples, where the Class attribute has n values (vj, ... , v,) and s; is the
number of samples belonging to class label v;, is given by

1(S,)Sy--5, )=—>P; log, P;
a

where p; is the probability that a random sample belongs to the class with label v;. An
estimate for p; is s;/s. Consider an attribute A with values {v;, ... , v,;,} used as the test
attribute for splitting in the decision tree. Attribute A partitions the samples into the
subsets Sj), ... , S,,, where samples in each S; have a value of v; for attribute A. Each S,
may contain samples that belong to any of the classes. The number of samples in S; that
belong to class i can be denoted as s;. The entropy associated with using attribute A as
the test attribute is defined as
