the interrupt handling is complete. Once a nested interrupt has been serviced, then control is

relinquished to the original interrupt service routine.

The second method involves prioritization. You program the interrupt controller to ignore
interrupts of the same or lower priority than the interrupt you are handling, so only a higher-

priority task can interrupt your handler. You then reenable interrupts.

The processor spends time in the lower-priority interrupts until a higher-priority interrupt occurs.
Therefore higher-priority interrupts have a lower average interrupt latency than the lower-
priority interrupts, which reduces latency by speeding up the completion time on the critical

time-sensitive interrupts.

2.3 IRQ and FIQ Exceptions

IRQ and FIQ exceptions only occur when a specific interrupt mask is cleared in the cpsr. The
ARM processor will continue executing the current instruction in the execution stage of the
pipeline before handling the interrupt—an important factor in designing a deterministic interrupt

handler since some instructions require more cycles to complete the execution stage.

An IRQ or FIQ exception causes the processor hardware to go through a standard procedure

(provided the interrupts are not masked):
