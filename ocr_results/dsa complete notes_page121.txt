b=26, s=2

n=10 distinct identifiers- each representing a C library function

Loading factor a = n/(sb) = 10/52=0.19

f(x)= first character of x

x: acos, define, float, exp, char,atan, ceil, floor, clock, ctime
f(x) :0, 3, 5, 4, 2, 0, 2, 5, 2, 2

DiViSiGh : Chose a number m larger than the number n of keys in K. The number m is chosen to be a
prime number or a number without small divisors to reduce collisions. The function is defined as

Bucket addresses range from 0 to m-1 and the hash table must have m buckets

Mid)Sqware: In this method the square of the key is found and appropriate number of bits are used
from the middle of the square to obtain the bucket address
