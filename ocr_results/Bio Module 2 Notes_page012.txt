However, it is important to note that not all whey protein products are equal in terms
of quality, purity, and nutrient content. Some whey protein supplements may contain added
sugars, artificial sweeteners, or other ingredients that can be harmful to health. It is therefore
important to choose a reputable brand and to carefully read the ingredient list before

purchasing.

Preparation of Whey Protein

Whey protein is extracted from milk during the cheese-making process. Here’s how it is

prepared step by step:
1. Milk Separation (Cheese Production Process)

e Fresh cow’s milk is pasteurized to remove harmful bacteria.
¢ A coagulant (such as rennet or an acid like lemon juice) is added to the milk, causing
the casein (solid part) to separate from the whey (liquid part).

¢ The solid curds are used to make cheese, while the leftover liquid is whey.
2. Filtration and Purification

¢ The whey is filtered through microfiltration or ultrafiltration to remove fats, lactose,
and excess water.
¢ Different levels of filtration determine the type of whey protein:
o Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC): Lightly filtered, retains some fats and
lactose.
o Whey Protein Isolate (WPI): More refined, removing most fats and lactose.

o Whey Protein Hydrolysate (WPH): Pre-digested for faster absorption.
3. Drying (Powder Formation)

¢ The purified whey is dried using spray drying to turn it into a fine powder.
