Then the contents of RI are transferred to register Y in step 5, to prepare for the addition operation. When
the Read operation is completed, the memory operand is available in register MDR, and the addition
operation is performed in step 6. The contents of MDR are gated to the bus, and thus also to the B input of
the ALU, and register Y is selected as the second input to the ALU by choosing Select Y. The sum is
stored in register Z, then transferred to RI in step 7.

This discussion accounts for all control signals in Figure 7.6 except Y in step 2. There is no need to copy
the updated contents of PC into register Y when executing the Add instruction. But, in Branch
instructions the updated value of the PC is needed to compute the Branch target address. To speed up the
execution of Branch instructions, this value is copied into register Y in step 2. Since step 2 is part of the
fetch phase, the same action will be performed for all instructions. This does not cause any harm because
register Y is not used for any other purpose at that time. Branch Instructions: A branch instruction
replaces the contents of the PC with the branch target address. This address is usually obtained by adding
an offset X, which is given in the branch instruction, to the updated value of the PC. Listing in figure 8
below gives a control sequence that implements an unconditional branch instruction. Processing starts, as
usual, with the fetch phase. This phase ends when the instruction is loaded into the IR in step 3. The offset
value is extracted from the IR by the instruction decoding circuit, which will also perform sign extension
if required. Since the value of the updated PC is already available in register Y, the offset X is gated onto
the bus in step 4, and an addition operation is performed. The result, which is the branch target address, is
loaded into the PC in step 5. The offset X used in a branch instruction is usually the difference between
the branch target address and the address immediately following the branch instruction.

For example, if the branch instruction is at location 2000 and if the branch target address is 2050, the value
of X must be 46. The reason for this can be readily appreciated from the control sequence in Figure 7. The
PC is incremented during the fetch phase, before knowing the type of instruction being executed. Thus,
when the branch address is computed in step 4, the PC value used is the updated value, which points to
the instruction following the branch instruction in the memory. Consider now a conditional branch. In this
case, we need to check the status of the condition codes before loading a new value into the PC. For
example, for a Branch-nonnegative

Hardwired Control

To execute instructions, the processor must have some means of generating the control signals needed in
the proper sequence.

Two categories: hardwired control and micro programmed control

Hardwired system can operate at high speed; but with little flexibility

Control Unit Organization

Pipelining

Pipelining is widely used in modern processors.
Pipelining improves system performance in terms of throughput.
Pipelined organization requires sophisticated compilation techniques.

Making the Execution of Programs Faster

Use faster circuit technology to build the processor and the main memory.
Arrange the hardware so that more than one operation can be performed at the same time.

In the latter way, the number of operations performed per second is increased even though the elapsed
time needed to perform any one operation is not changed.
