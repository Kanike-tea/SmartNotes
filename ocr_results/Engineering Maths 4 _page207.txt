Now, as a consequence of Cauchy's theorem,

1 .
The equation of ‘C, (circle with centre ‘a’ and radius r) can be written in the form
|z-al| =r. Thatis equivalent to,
z-a=ré® o z=atre®, 0<0<2n dz=ire dO.

Using these results in the RHS of (1) we have,

This is true for any r > 0 however see Hence as r > 0 we get,

Thus f(a) = i deck dz { Cauchy's integral formula}

Applying Leibnitz rule for differentiation under the integral sign we have,
