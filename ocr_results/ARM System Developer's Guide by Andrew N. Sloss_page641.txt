628 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

GET
See INCLUDE.

GLOBAL
See EXPORT.

IF (alias [), ELSE (alias |), ENDIF (alias ])

‘These directives provide for conditional assembly. They are similar to #if, #e1se, #endif,
available in C. The IF directive is followed by a logical expression. The ELSE directive may
be omitted. For example:

IF ARCHITECTURE="5TE"
SMULBB r0, rl, rl
ELSE
MUL r0, rl, rl
ENDIF

IMPORT
See EXTERN.

INCBIN
INCBIN <filename>

This directive includes the raw data contained in the binary file <filename> at the current
point in the assembly. For example, INCBIN table.dat.

INCLUDE (alias GET)
INCLUDE <filename>

Use this directive to include another assembly file. It is similar to the #include command in
C. For example, INCLUDE header.h.

INFO (alias !)

INFO <numeric_expression>, <string_expression>

If <numeric_expresssion> is nonzero, then assembly terminates with error <string_expresssion>.
Otherwise the assembler prints <string_expression> as an information message.
