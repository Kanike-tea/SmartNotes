Specifying the object
types EMPLOYEE,

type constructors.

define type EMPLOYEE

tuple ( Fname: string;
Minit : char;
Lname: string;
Ssn: string;
Birth_date: DATE;
Address: string;
Sex: char;
Salary: float;
Supervisor: EMPLOYEE;
Dept: DEPARTMENT;

define type DATE

Month: integer;
Day: integer; );

define type DEPARTMENT

of EMPLOYEE is of type DEPARTMENT and hence is used to refer to a specific
DEPARTMENT object (the DEPARTMENT object where the employee works). The
value of such an attribute would be an OID for a specific DEPARTMENT object. A
binary relationship can be represented in one direction, or it can have an inverse
reference. The latter representation makes it easy to traverse the relationship in both
directions. For example, in Figure 12.1 the attribute Employees of DEPARTMENT has
as its value a set of references (that is, a set of OIDs) to objects of type EMPLOYEE;
these are the employees who work for the DEPARTMENT. The inverse is the refer-
ence attribute Dept of EMPLOYEE. We will see in Section 12.3 how the ODMG stan-
dard allows inverses to be explicitly declared as relationship attributes to ensure
that inverse references are consistent.

12.1.4 Encapsulation of Operations
and Persistence of Objects

Encapsulation of Operations. The concept of encapsulation is one of the main
characteristics of OO languages and systems. It is also related to the concepts of
abstract data types and information hiding in programming languages. In tradi-
tional database models and systems this concept was not applied, since it is cus-
tomary to make the structure of database objects visible to users and external
programs. In these traditional models, a number of generic database operations
