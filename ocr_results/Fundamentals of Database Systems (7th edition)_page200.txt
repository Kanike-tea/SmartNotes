170 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

discussed the schema constraints pertaining to the relational model, starting with
domain constraints, then key constraints (including the concepts of superkey,
key, and primary key), and the NOT NULL constraint on attributes. We defined
relational databases and relational database schemas. Additional relational con-
straints include the entity integrity constraint, which prohibits primary key attri-
butes from being NULL. We described the interrelation referential integrity
constraint, which is used to maintain consistency of references among tuples
from various relations.

The modification operations on the relational model are Insert, Delete, and Update.
Each operation may violate certain types of constraints (refer to Section 5.3). When-
ever an operation is applied, the resulting database state must be a valid state.
Finally, we introduced the concept of a transaction, which is important in relational
DBMSs because it allows the grouping of several database operations into a single
atomic action on the database.

Review Questions

5.1. Define the following terms as they apply to the relational model of data:
domain, attribute, n-tuple, relation schema, relation state, degree of a rela-
tion, relational database schema, and relational database state.

5.2. Why are tuples in a relation not ordered?
5.3. Why are duplicate tuples not allowed in a relation?
5.4. What is the difference between a key and a superkey?

5.5. Why do we designate one of the candidate keys of a relation to be the pri-
mary key?

5.6. Discuss the characteristics of relations that make them different from ordi-
nary tables and files.

5.7. Discuss the various reasons that lead to the occurrence of NULL values in
relations.

5.8. Discuss the entity integrity and referential integrity constraints. Why is each
considered important?

5.9. Define foreign key. What is this concept used for?

5.10. What is a transaction? How does it differ from an Update operation?

Exercises

5.11. Suppose that each of the following Update operations is applied directly to
the database state shown in Figure 5.6. Discuss all integrity constraints
