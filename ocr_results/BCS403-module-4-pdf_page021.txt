Database Management System [BCS403]

SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM WORKS_ON1
WHERE Pname='‘ProductX’;

The same query would require the specification of two joins if specified on the base relations
directly. one of the main advantages of a view is to simplify the specification of certain queries.
Views are also used as a security and authorization mechanism.

A view is supposed to be always up-to-date; if we modify the tuples in the base tables on which the
view is defined, the view must automatically reflect these changes. Hence, the view is not realized
or materialized at the time of view definition but rather at the time when we specify a query on the
view. It is the responsibility of the DBMS and not the user to make sure that the view is kept up-to-
date.

If we do not need a view any more, we can use the DROP VIEW command to dispose of it. For
example : DROP VIEW WORKS_ON1;

1.3.3 View Implementation, View Update and Inline Views
The problem of efficiently implementing a view for querying is complex. Two main approaches have
been suggested.
= One strategy, called query modification, involves modifying or transforming the view query
(submitted by the user) into a query on the underlying base tables. For example, the query
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM WORKS_ON1
WHERE Pname='ProductX’;

would be automatically modified to the following query by the DBMS:
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON
WHERE Ssn=Essn AND Pno=Pnumber
AND Pname=‘Productx’;

The disadvantage of this approach is that it is inefficient for views defined via complex queries that
are time-consuming to execute, especially if multiple queries are going to be applied to the same
view within a short period of time.

= The second strategy, called view materialization, involves physically creating a temporary view
table when the view is first queried and keeping that table on the assumption that other queries
on the view will follow. In this case, an efficient strategy for automatically updating the view table
when the base tables are updated must be developed in order to keep the view up-to-date.
