COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21834) Module 3
a) Data transfer between two registers.

Format: Opcode Sourcel , Destination
The processor uses MOV instruction to perform data transfer operation between two registers
The mathematical representation of this instruction is Rl > R2.
Ex: MOV R1i,R2: Rl and R2 are the registers.
Where MOV is the operation code, R1 is the source operand and R2 is the destination operand.
This instruction transfers the contents of R1 to R2.
EX: Before the execution of MOV R1,R2, the contents of RI’and R2 are as follows
R1=34h and R2=65h
After the execution of MOV R1, R2, the contents of R1_and R2 are as follows
R1=34H and R2=34H

b) Data transfer from memory to register
The processor uses LOAD instruction to perform data transfer operation from memory to
register. The mathematical representation of this instruction is
[LOCA] — ACC. Where ACC is the Accumulator.
Format: opcode operand
Ex: LOAD LOCA
For this instruction Memory Location is the source and Accumulator is the destination.

c) Data transfer from Aceumulator register to memory
The processonuses STORE instruction to perform data transfer operation from
Accumulator register to memory,location. The mathematical representation of this instruction is
[ACC] — LOCA. Where, ACC is the Accumulator.
Format: opcode, operand
Ex: STORE LOCA
For this instruction accumulator is the source and memory location is the destination.

2. ALU Operations

The instructions are designed to perform arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction,
Multiplication and Division as well as logical operations such as AND, OR and NOT operations.
Ex1: ADD Ro, Ri

The mathematical representation of this instruction is as follows:

Ri [Ro] + [Ri]; Adds the content of Ro with the content of Ri and result is placed in Ri.
Ex2: SUB Ro, Ri

The mathematical representation of this instruction is as follows:

Ri< [Ro] - [Ri] ; Subtracts the content of Ro from the content of Ri and result is placed

inR.
EX3: AND Ro,R1 ; It Logically multiplies the content of Ro with the content of Ri and result is
stored in Ri, (Ri= Ro AND R1)
Ex4: NOT Ro ; It performs the function of complementation.
