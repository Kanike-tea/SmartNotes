JOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

[42] Joint Probability Distributions

“Wehave discussed probability distributions associated witha single random variable.
The same can be generalized for two or more random variables. We discuss probability
ae associated. with two random variables referred to as joint distributions.

"Joint probability: ‘and Joint probability distribution

If X and Y are two discreté random variables, we define the joint probability function of

X and Y by

P(X='x, Y=y) =f(%y) .
where f (x; y) satisfy the conditions
f(x, ”) > 0 and +. fy) =1
ig second condition means that the. sum over all the values of x and y is equal to
ne,

Suppose X = [a2 wiv) and Y= [45s tgs 4g} then

P(X =x, Y= UY = f(x, Yj) denoted by Jj;

It should be observed that f isa function on the cartesian scl of the sets X and

Y as we have

xXxY= {we (Xr Yd (% mn}

f is also referied to as joint probability density function of X and Y inthe con

. order. The set of values of this function f(x;, y;) = hi; fr 24,2,

j=1,2,.+++n is‘called the joint probability disteibution of X and Y. ra

_ Values are presented | in the form of a two way table called the joint probability table.
