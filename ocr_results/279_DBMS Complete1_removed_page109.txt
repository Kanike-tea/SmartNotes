How Data is Stored

Two basic methods are used to store objects by different database vendors.

e Each object has a unique ID and is defined as a subclass of a base class, using inheritance to
determine attributes.
e Virtual memory mapping is used for object storage and management.

Data

Warehouse

A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile
collection of data in support of management's decision making process.
Subject-Oriented: A data warehouse can be used to analyze a particular subject area.
For example, "sales" can be a particular subject.

Integrated: A data warehouse integrates data from multiple data sources. For example,
source A and source B may have different ways of identifying a product, but in a data
warehouse, there will be only a single way of identifying a product.

Time-Variant: Historical data is kept in a data warehouse. For example, one can
retrieve data from 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, or even older data from a data
warehouse. This contrasts with a transactions system, where often only the most recent
data is kept. For example, a transaction system may hold the most recent address of a
customer, where a data warehouse can hold all addresses associated with a customer.
Non-volatile: Once data is in the data warehouse, it will not change. So, historical data
in a data warehouse should never be altered.
