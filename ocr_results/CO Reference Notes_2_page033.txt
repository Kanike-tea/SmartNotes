¢ In parallel-port, the connection between the device and the computer uses
— a multiple-pin connector and
— acable with as many wires.
© This arrangement is suitable for devices that are physically close to the computer.
¢ In serial port, it is much more convenient and cost-effective where longer cables are needed.

Functions of I/O Interface
1) Provides a storage buffer for at least one word of data.

2) Contains status-flags that can be accessed by the processor to determine whether the buffer
is full or empty.

3) Contains address-decoding circuitry to determine when it is being addressed by

the processor.

4) Generates the appropriate timing signals required by the bus control scheme.

5) Performs any format conversion that may be necessary to transfer data between the bus and
the I/O device (such as parallel-serial conversion in the case of a serial port).

¢ The output of the encoder consists of

— bits representing the encoded character and

— one signal called valid, which indicates the key is pressed.
¢ The information is sent to the interface-circuits (Figure 7.10).
¢ Interface-circuits contain

1) Data register DATAIN &

2) Status-flag SIN.
© When a key is pressed, the Valid signal changes from 0

tol. Then, SIN=1 > when ASCII code is loaded

into DATAIN.

SIN = 0 > when processor reads the contents of the DATAIN.

¢ The interface-circuit is connected to the asynchronous bus.
¢ Data transfers on the bus are controlled using the handshake signals:

1) Master ready &

2) Slave ready.
