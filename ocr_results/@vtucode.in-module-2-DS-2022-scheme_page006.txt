DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 2

Implementation of Circular Queue Operations

When the array is viewed as a circle, each array position has a next and a previous
position. The position next to MAX-QUEUE-SIZE -1 is 0, and the position that
precedes 0 is MAX-QUEUE-SIZE -1.

When the queue rear is at MAX_QUEUE_SIZE-1, the next element is inserted at
position 0.

In circular queue, the variables front and rear are moved from their current
position to the next position in clockwise direction. This may be done using code

if (rear =

MAX_QUEUE_SIZE-1)
rear =0;
else rear++;

Addition & Deletion

To add an element, increment rear one position clockwise and. insert at the new
position. Here the MAX_QUEUE_SIZE is 8 and if all 8 elements are added into
queue and that can be represented in below figure (a).

To delete an element, increment front one position clockwise. The element A is
deleted from queue and if we perform 6 deletions from the queue of Figure (b) in
this fashion, then queue becomes empty and that front =rear.

If the element I is added into the queue as in figure (c), then rear needs to
increment by | and the value of rear is 8. Since queue is circular, the next

position should be 0 instead of 8.

This can be done by using the modulus operator, which computes remainders.
