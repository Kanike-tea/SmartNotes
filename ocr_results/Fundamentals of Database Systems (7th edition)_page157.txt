4.6 Example of Other Notation: Representing Specialization and Generalization in UML Class Diagrams 127

A predicate p; on the attributes of D; can be used to specify the members of each D;
that are members of T. If a predicate is specified on every Dj, we get

T= (Dlpil V Dalp2] -- V Dal Pnl)

We should now extend the definition of relationship type given in Chapter 3 by
allowing any class—not only any entity type—to participate in a relationship.
Hence, we should replace the words entity type with class in that definition. The
graphical notation of EER is consistent with ER because all classes are represented
by rectangles.

Specialization and Generalization in UML
Class Diagrams

We now discuss the UML notation for generalization/specialization and inheri-
tance. We already presented basic UML class diagram notation and terminology
in Section 3.8. Figure 4.10 illustrates a possible UML class diagram corresponding
to the EER diagram in Figure 4.7. The basic notation for specialization/generaliza-
tion (see Figure 4.10) is to connect the subclasses by vertical lines to a horizontal
line, which has a triangle connecting the horizontal line through another vertical
line to the superclass. A blank triangle indicates a specialization/generalization
with the disjoint constraint, and a filled triangle indicates an overlapping con-
straint. The root superclass is called the base class, and the subclasses (leaf nodes)
are called leaf classes.

The preceding discussion and the example in Figure 4.10, as well as the presenta-
tion in Section 3.8, gave a brief overview of UML class diagrams and terminology.
We focused on the concepts that are relevant to ER and EER database modeling
rather than on those concepts that are more relevant to software engineering. In
UML, there are many details that we have not discussed because they are outside
the scope of this text and are mainly relevant to software engineering. For example,
classes can be of various types:

= Abstract classes define attributes and operations but do not have objects
corresponding to those classes. These are mainly used to specify a set of
attributes and operations that can be inherited.

= Concrete classes can have objects (entities) instantiated to belong to the
class.

= Template classes specify a template that can be further used to define
other classes.

In database design, we are mainly concerned with specifying concrete classes whose
collections of objects are permanently (or persistently) stored in the database. The
bibliographic notes at the end of this chapter give some references to books that
describe complete details of UML.
