Quadruple two-to-one-line multiplexer

Multiplexer circuits can be combined with common selection inputs to provide multiple-bit selection
logic. As an illustration, a quadruple 2-to-1-line multiplexer is shown in Fig below. The circuit has four
multiplexers, each capable of selecting one of two input lines. Output Yo can be selected to come from
either input Ao or input Bo. Similarly, output Y1 may have the value of Aj or Bi, and so on. Input selection
line S selects one of the lines in each of the four multiplexers. The enable input E must be active (i.e.,
asserted) for normal operation. Although the circuit contains four 2-to-1-line multiplexers, we are more
likely to view it as a circuit that selects one of two 4-bit sets of data lines. As shown in the function table,
the unit is enabled when E = 0. Then, if S = 0, the four A inputs have a path to the four outputs. If, by
contrast, S = 1, the four B inputs are applied to the outputs. The outputs have all 0’s when E = 1,
regardless of the value of S.

Quadruple two-to-one-line multiplexer

Boolean Function Implementation using MUX
1. Consider the Boolean function F (x, y, z) = X(1, 2, 6, 7).

This function of three variables can be implemented with a four-to-one-line multiplexer as shown in fig
below. The two variables x and y are applied to the selection lines in that order; x is connected to the S;
input and y to the So input. The values for the data input lines are determined from the truth table of the
function. When xy = 00, output F is equal to z because F = 0 when z = 0 and F = 1 when z = 1. This
requires that variable z be applied to data input 0. The operation of the multiplexer is such that when
xy = 00, data input 0 has a path to the output, and that makes F equal to z . In a similar fashion, we can
determine the required input to data lines 1, 2, and 3 from the value of F when xy = 01, 10, and 11,
respectively. This particular example shows all four possibilities that can be obtained for the data inputs.
