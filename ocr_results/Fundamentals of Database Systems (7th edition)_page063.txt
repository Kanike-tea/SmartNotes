2.1. Data Models, Schemas, and Instances

2.1.1 Categories of Data Models

Many data models have been proposed, which we can categorize according to
the types of concepts they use to describe the database structure. High-level or
conceptual data models provide concepts that are close to the way many users per-
ceive data, whereas low-level or physical data models provide concepts that describe
the details of how data is stored on the computer storage media, typically magnetic
disks. Concepts provided by physical data models are generally meant for computer
specialists, not for end users. Between these two extremes is a class of representational
(or implementation) data models,’ which provide concepts that may be easily
understood by end users but that are not too far removed from the way data is orga-
nized in computer storage. Representational data models hide many details of data
storage on disk but can be implemented on a computer system directly.

Conceptual data models use concepts such as entities, attributes, and relationships.
An entity represents a real-world object or concept, such as an employee or a project
from the miniworld that is described in the database. An attribute represents some
property of interest that further describes an entity, such as the employee’s name or
salary. A relationship among two or more entities represents an association among
the entities, for example, a works-on relationship between an employee and a
project. Chapter 3 presents the entity-relationship model—a popular high-level
conceptual data model. Chapter 4 describes additional abstractions used for advanced
modeling, such as generalization, specialization, and categories (union types).

Representational or implementation data models are the models used most fre-
quently in traditional commercial DBMSs. These include the widely used relational
data model, as well as the so-called legacy data models—the network and
hierarchical models—that have been widely used in the past. Part 3 of the text is
devoted to the relational data model, and its constraints, operations, and languages.°
The SQL standard for relational databases is described in Chapters 6 and 7. Repre-
sentational data models represent data by using record structures and hence are
sometimes called record-based data models.

We can regard the object data model as an example of a new family of higher-level
implementation data models that are closer to conceptual data models. A standard
for object databases called the ODMG object model has been proposed by the
Object Data Management Group (ODMG). We describe the general characteristics
of object databases and the object model proposed standard in Chapter 12. Object
data models are also frequently utilized as high-level conceptual models, particu-
larly in the software engineering domain.

Physical data models describe how data is stored as files in the computer by repre-
senting information such as record formats, record orderings, and access paths. An

“The term implementation data model is not a standard term; we have introduced it to refer to the avail-
able data models in commercial database systems.
