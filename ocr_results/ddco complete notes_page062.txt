Donecice D flip-flop

The construction of a D flip-flop with two D latches and an inverter is shown in
Fig. 5.9 . The first latch is called the master and the second the slave. The
circuit samples the D input and changes its output Q only at the negative edge
of the synchronizing or controlling clock (designated as Clk ). When the clock is
0, the output of the inverter is 1. The slave latch is enabled, and its output Q is
equal to the master output Y . The master latch is disabled because Clk = 0.
When the input pulse changes to the logic-1 level, the data from the external D
input are transferred to the master. The slave, however, is disabled as long as
the clock remains at the 1 level, because its enable input is equal to 0. Any
change in the input changes the master output at Y, but cannot affect the slave
output. When the clock pulse returns to 0, the master is disabled and is isolated
from the D input. At the same time, the slave is enabled and the value of Y is
transferred to the output of the flip-flop at Q . Thus, a change in the output of
the flip-flop can be triggered only by and during the transition of the clock from
1 to 0.

Comparison between Latch and Flipflop

LATCH

FLIP — FLOP

Latches do not require clock signal_

Flip — flops have clock signals

‘A latch is an asynchronous device

‘A flip — flop is a synchronous
device.

Latches are transparent devicesie.

when they are enabled, the output

changes immediately if the input
changes

A latch is a Level Sensitive device
(Level Triggering is involved)

‘A transition from low to high or high
to low of the clock signal will cause
the flip — flop to either change its
output or retain it depending on the
input signal
‘A flip — flop is an edge sensitive
device (Edge Triggering is
involved).

Latches are simpler to design as
there is no clock signal (ne careful
routing of clock signal is required),

‘The operation of a latch is faster as
they do not have to wait for any
clock signal

‘When compare to latches, flip —
flops are more complex to design as
they have clock signal and it has to
be carefully routed. This is because
all the flip — flops in a design should
have a clock signal and the delay in
the clock reaching each flip — flop
must be minimum or negligible.
Flip - flops are comparatively slower
than latches due te clock signal.

The power requirement of a lateh is
less.

Power requirement of a flip — flop is
more,

A latch works based on the enable
signal
