. A software engineer goes to his office everyday by motorbike or by car. He never

goes by bike on two consecutive days, but if he goes by car ona day then he is
equally likely to go by car or by bike the next day. Find the t- P-m ofthe Markov
chain: If car is used on the first day of the week find the probability that after 4
days (a). bike is used (b) car is used.

. Asalesman’s territory consists of 3 cities A, B, C. Henever sells in the same city

for 2 consecutive days. If he sells in city A, then the next day he sells in city B,

- However if he sells in either B or C, then the next day he is twice as likely to

sell in city A (as in the other city. In the long run how often does he sell in each
ofthecities?- 7.
