Pulses are a large group of plants, which include chickpeas, lentils, beans (such as black,
kidney and adzuki beans) and split peas.

Plant proteins are highly nutritious — not only as good sources of protein, but also because
they provide other nutrients such as fibre, vitamins and minerals. Our intake of fibre tends to
be too low, however by incorporating certain plant proteins into your diet, such as pulses,

peas and nuts, you can easily boost your fibre intake.

8. What are lipids? Briefly explain the different types of lipids.

Answer:

“Lipids are organic compounds that contain hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms, which
form the framework for the structure and function of living cells.”

Properties:

Lipids are oily or greasy nonpolar molecules, stored in the adipose tissue of the body.
Lipids are a heterogeneous group of compounds, mainly composed of hydrocarbon
chains.

Lipids are energy-rich organic molecules, which provide energy for different life
processes.

Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the
amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles,
multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment.
Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical
subunits or "building-blocks": ketoacyl and isoprene groups.Using this approach,
lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acyls, glycerolipids,
glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from
condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids.

Lipids as cleansing agents/detergents:

Soap is a form of lipid which is a mixture of sodium salts of various naturally
occurring fatty acids.

When air bubbles are added to a molten soap, the density of the soap decreases thus
making it float on water.

A softer soap results when the fatty acid salt contains potassium rather than sodium.
Soap is the product of a saponification or basic hydrolysis reaction of a fat or oil.
Sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide is currently used to neutralize the fatty acid
and convert it to the salt.

The basic hydrolysis reaction is as follows:

Fat + NaOH — sodium salt of fatty acid + glycerol
