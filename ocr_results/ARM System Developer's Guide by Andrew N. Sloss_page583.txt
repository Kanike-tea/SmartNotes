570 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

Table A.1 Instruction types.

Type Meaning

ARMvX 32-bit ARM instruction first appearing in ARM architecture version X
THUMBvX 16-bit Thumb instruction first appearing in Thumb architecture version X
MACRO Assembler pseudoinstruction

condition <cond> is passed. Each entry also describes the action of the instruction if it is
executed.

The {S} denotes that you may apply an optional $ suffix to the instruction. Finally,
the right-hand column specifies that the instruction is available from the listed ARM
architecture version onwards. Table A.1 shows the entries possible for this column.

Note that there is no direct correlation between the Thumb architecture number and
the ARM architecture number. The THUMBv1 architecture is used in ARMvA4T processors;
the THUMBv2 architecture, in ARMv5T processors; and the THUMBv3 architecture, in
ARMv6 processors.

Each instruction definition is followed by a notes section describing restrictions on the
use of the instruction. When we make a statement such as “Rd must not be pc,” we mean
that the description of the function only applies when this condition holds. If you break
the condition, then the instruction may be unpredictable or have predictable effects that we
haven’t had space to describe here. Well-written programs should not need to break these
conditions.

A.2 SYNTAX

We use the following syntax and abbreviations throughout this appendix.

A.2.1 OPTIONAL EXPRESSIONS

= {<expr>} is an optional expression. For example, LDR{B} is shorthand for LDR or LDRB.
= {<exp1>|<exp2>l...l<expN>}, including at least one “|” divider, is a list of expressions.
One of the listed expressions must appear. For example LDR{B|H} is shorthand for
LDRB or LDRH. It does not include LDR. We would represent these three possibilities by

LDR{ |B] H}.

A.2.2. REGISTER NAMES

= Rd, Rn, Rm, Rs, RHi, RdLo represent ARM registers in the range r0 to r15.

= Ld, Ln, Lm, Ls represent low-numbered ARM registers in the range r0 to 17.
