16.11 Modern Storage Architectures

elements of SCSI and FC (just like iSCSI), but it does not include TCP/IP compo-
nents. FCoE has been successfully productized by CISCO (termed “Data Center
Ethernet”) and Brocade. It takes advantage of a reliable ethernet technology that
uses buffering and end-to-end flow control to avoid dropped packets. This prom-
ises excellent performance, especially on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE), and is
relatively easy for vendors to add to their products.

16.11.4 Automated Storage Tiering

Another trend in storage is automated storage tiering (AST), which automati-
cally moves data between different storage types such as SATA, SAS, and solid-
state drives (SSDs) depending on the need. The storage administrator can set up
a tiering policy in which less frequently used data is moved to slower and cheaper
SATA drives and more frequently used data is moved up to solid-state drives
(see Table 16.1 for the various tiers of storage ordered by increasing speed of
access). This automated tiering can improve database performance tremendously.

EMC has an implementation of this technology called FAST (fully automated stor-
age tiering) that does continuous monitoring of data activity and takes actions to
move the data to the appropriate tier based on the policy.

16.11.5 Object-Based Storage

During the last few years, there have been major developments in terms of rapid
growth of the cloud concept, distributed architectures for databases and for analyt-
ics, and development of data-intensive applications on the Web (see Chapters 23,
24, and 25). These developments have caused fundamental changes in enterprise
storage infrastructure. The hardware-oriented file-based systems are evolving into
new open-ended architectures for storage. The latest among these is object-based
storage. Under this scheme, data is managed in the form of objects rather than files
made of blocks. Objects carry metadata that contains properties that can be used for
managing those objects. Each object carries a unique global identifier that is used to
locate it. Object storage has its origins in research projects at CMU (Gibson et al.,
1996) on scaling up of network attached storage and in the Oceanstore system at
UC Berkeley (Kubiatowicz et al., 2000), which attempted to build a global infra-
structure over all forms of trusted and untrusted servers for continuous access to
persistent data. There is no need to do lower level storage operations in terms of
capacity management or making decisions like what type of RAID architecture
should be used for fault protection.

Object storage also allows additional flexibility in terms of interfaces—it gives con-
trol to applications that can control the objects directly and also allows the objects
to be addressable across a wide namespace spanning multiple devices. Replication
and distribution of objects is also supported. In general, object storage is ideally
suited for scalable storage of massive amounts of unstructured data such as Web
pages, images, and audio/video clips and files. Object-based storage device com-
mands (OSDs) were proposed as part of SCSI protocol a long time ago but did not
