Database Management System [BCS403]

1.1.1 Domains, Attributes, Tuples, and Relations

Domain
A domain D is a set of atomic values. By atomic we mean that each value in the domain is
indivisible as far as the formal relational model is concerned. A common method of specifying
a domain is to specify a data type from which the data values forming the domain are drawn. It
is also useful to specify a name for the domain, to help in interpreting its values.
Some examples of domains follow:

= Usa_phone_numbers: The set of ten-digit phone numbers valid in the United States.

= Social_security_numbers: The set of valid nine-digit Social Security numbers.

= Names: The set of character strings that represent names of persons.

= Employee_ages. Possible ages of employees in a company; each must be an integer

value between 15 and 80.

The preceding are called logical definitions of domains. A data type or format is also specified
for each domain. For example, the data type for the domain Usa_phone_numbers can be
declared as a character string of the form (ddd)ddddddd, where each d is a numeric (decimal)
digit and the first three digits form a valid telephone area code. The data type for

Employee_ages is an integer number between 15 and 80.

Attribute

An attribute Aj is the name of a role played by some domain D in the relation schema R. D is

called the domain of Aj and is denoted by dom(ai).

Tuple
Mapping from attributes to values drawn from the respective domains of those attributes. Tuples
are intended to describe some entity (or relationship between entities) in the miniworld
Example: a tuple fora PERSON entity might be

{ Name --> “smith", Gender --> Male, Age --> 25 }

Relation

A named set of tuples all of the same form i.e., having the same set of attributes.
