Selected Bibliography

STARBURST rules are described in Widom and Finkelstein (1990). Early work on
active databases includes the HiPAC project, discussed in Chakravarthy et al. (1989)
and Chakravarthy (1990). A glossary for temporal databases is given in Jensen et al.
(1994). Snodgrass (1987) focuses on TQuel, an early temporal query language.

Temporal normalization is defined in Navathe and Ahmed (1989). Paton (1999) and
Paton and Diaz (1999) survey active databases. Chakravarthy et al. (1994) describe
SENTINEL and object-based active systems. Lee et al. (1998) discuss time series
management.

The book by Shekhar and Chawla (2003) consists of all aspects of spatial databases includ-
ing spatial data models, spatial storage and indexing, and spatial data mining. Scholl et al.
(2001) is another textbook on spatial data management. Albrecht (1996) describes in
detail the various GIS analysis operations. Clementini and Di Felice (1993) give a detailed
description of the spatial operators. Giiting (1994) describes the spatial data structures and
querying languages for spatial database systems. Guttman (1984) proposed R-trees for
spatial data indexing. Manolopoulos et al. (2005) is a book on the theory and applications
of R-trees. Papadias et al. (2003) discuss query processing using R-trees for spatial net-
works. Ester et al. (2001) provide a comprehensive discussion on the algorithms and appli-
cations of spatial data mining. Koperski and Han (1995) discuss association rule discovery
from geographic databases. Brinkhoff et al. (1993) provide a comprehensive overview of
the usage of R-trees for efficient processing of spatial joins. Rotem (1991) describes spatial
join indexes comprehensively. Shekhar and Xiong (2008) is a compilation of various
sources that discuss different aspects of spatial database management systems and GIS.
The density-based clustering algorithms DBSCAN and DENCLUE are proposed by Ester
et al. (1996) and Hinnenberg and Gabriel (2007), respectively.

Multimedia database modeling has a vast amount of literature—it is difficult to point
to all important references here. IBM’s QBIC (Query By Image Content) system
described in Niblack et al. (1998) was one of the first comprehensive approaches for
querying images based on content. It is now available as a part of IBM’s DB2 data-
base image extender. Zhao and Grosky (2002) discuss content-based image retrieval.
Carneiro and Vasconselos (2005) present a database-centric view of semantic image
annotation and retrieval. Content-based retrieval of subimages is discussed by Luo
and Nascimento (2004). Tuceryan and Jain (1998) discuss various aspects of texture
analysis. Object recognition using SIFT is discussed in Lowe (2004). Lazebnik et al.
(2004) describe the use of local affine regions to model 3D objects (RIFT). Among
other object recognition approaches, G-RIF is described in Kim et al. (2006). Bay et
al. (2006) discuss SURF, Ke and Sukthankar (2004) present PCA-SIFT, and Mikola-
jezyk and Schmid (2005) describe GLOH. Fan et al. (2004) present a technique for
automatic image annotation by using concept-sensitive objects. Fotouhi et al. (2007)
was the first international workshop on many faces of multimedia semantics, which
is continuing annually. Thuraisingham (2001) classifies audio data into different cat-
egories and, by treating each of these categories differently, elaborates on the use of
metadata for audio. Prabhakaran (1996) has also discussed how speech processing
techniques can add valuable metadata information to the audio piece.

The early developments of the logic and database approach are surveyed by Gallaire
et al. (1984). Reiter (1984) provides a reconstruction of relational database theory,
