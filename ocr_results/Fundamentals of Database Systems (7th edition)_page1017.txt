26.3 Spatial Database Concepts

time series involve temporal aggregation over higher granularity intervals—for
example, finding the average or maximum weekly closing stock price or the maxi-
mum and minimum monthly closing stock price from the daily information.

As another example, consider the daily sales dollar amount at each store of a chain
of stores owned by a particular company. Again, typical temporal aggregates would
be retrieving the weekly, monthly, or yearly sales from the daily sales information
(using the sum aggregate function), or comparing same store monthly sales with
previous monthly sales, and so on.

Because of the specialized nature of time series data and the lack of support for it in
older DBMSs, it has been common to use specialized time series management
systems rather than general-purpose DBMSs for managing such information. In
such systems, it has been common to store time series values in sequential order in
a file and apply specialized time series procedures to analyze the information. The
problem with this approach is that the full power of high-level querying in languages
such as SQL will not be available in such systems.

More recently, some commercial DBMS packages began offering time series exten-
sions, such as the Oracle time cartridge and the time series data blade of Informix
Universal Server. In addition, the TSQL2 language provides some support for time
series in the form of event tables.

26.3.1 Introduction to Spatial Databases

Spatial databases incorporate functionality that provides support for databases that
keep track of objects in a multidimensional space. For example, cartographic data-
bases that store maps include two-dimensional spatial descriptions of their objects—
from countries and states to rivers, cities, roads, seas, and so on. The systems
that manage geographic data and related applications are known as geographic
information systems (GISs), and they are used in areas such as environmental
applications, transportation systems, emergency response systems, and battle man-
agement. Other databases, such as meteorological databases for weather information,
are three-dimensional, since temperatures and other meteorological information are
related to three-dimensional spatial points. In general, a spatial database stores
objects that have spatial characteristics that describe them and that have spatial rela-
tionships among them. The spatial relationships among the objects are important,
and they are often needed when querying the database. Although a spatial database
can in general refer to an n-dimensional space for any n, we will limit our discussion
to two dimensions as an illustration.

A spatial database is optimized to store and query data related to objects in space,
including points, lines and polygons. Satellite images are a prominent example of
