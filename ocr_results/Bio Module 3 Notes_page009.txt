brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes atypical brain activity, leading
to impaired movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease can't be cured, but medications can help control the symptoms, often
dramatically. In some more advanced cases, surgery may be advised. Your health care provider
may also recommend lifestyle changes, especially ongoing aerobic exercise.

Engineering Solutions for Parkinson’s Disease

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and motor function.
There are several engineering solutions aimed at improving the quality of life for individuals with
Parkinson's disease, including:

O Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): DBS involves the implantation of electrodes into specific
regions of the brain to deliver electrical stimulation, which can help to relieve symptoms such as
tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement.

0 Exoskeletons: Exoskeletons are wearable devices that provide support and assistance for
individuals with mobility issues. Some exoskeletons have been developed specifically for people
with Parkinson's disease, and can help to improve balance, reduce tremors, and increase overall
mobility.

O Telerehabilitation: Telerehabilitation involves the use of telecommunication technology to
provide physical therapy and rehabilitation services to individuals with Parkinson's disease,
without the need for in-person visits to a therapist.

0 Smartwatch Applications: Smartwatch applications can be used to monitor symptoms of
Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, and provide reminders and prompts for medication and
exercise.

O Virtual Reality: Virtual reality systems can be used for rehabilitation and therapy for
individuals with Parkinson's disease, providing interactive and engaging environments for patients
to practice movements and improve coordination and balance.

These engineering solutions have the potential to significantly improve the quality of life
for individuals with Parkinson's disease, and ongoing research and development is aimed at
improving their effectiveness and accessibility. However, it is important to note that these
technologies are not a cure for Parkinson's disease and should be used in conjunction with other
forms of treatment and care.
