LECTURE-10: RELATIONAL MODEL

RELATIONAL MODEL
Relational model is simple model in which database is represented as a collection of “relations”
where each relation is represented by two-dimensional table.

account—number | branch_name | balance
‘A-101 Downtown | 500
A-102 Perryridge 400
A-201 Brighton 900
A-215 Mianus 700
A-217 Brighton 750
A-222 Redwood 700
A-305 Round Hill 350

The relational model was founded by E. F. Codd of the IBM in 1972. The basic concept in the
relational model is that of a relation.

Properties:

o It is column homogeneous. In other words, in any given column of a table, all items are of
the same kind.

o Each item is a simple number or a character string. That is a table must be in first normal
form.

o Allrows of a table are distinct.

o The ordering of rows with in a table is immaterial.

o The column of a table are assigned distinct names and the ordering of these columns is
immaterial.

Domain, attributes tuples and relational:

Tuple:
Each row in a table represents a record and is called a tuple .A table containing ‘n’ attributes in a
record is called is called n-tuple.

Attributes:

The name of each column in a table is used to interpret its meaning and is called an attribute Each
table is called a relation. In the above table, account_number, branch name, balance are the
attributes.

Domain:
A domain is a set of values that can be given to an attributes. So every attribute in a table has a
specific domain. Values to these attributes can not be assigned outside their domains.

Relation:

Arelation consist of

o Relational schema
o Relation instance

Relational Schema:
A relational schema specifies the relation’s name, its attributes and the domain of each attribute. If
