>The given graph has 6 vertices. Therefore, a minimal spanning tree thereof has 5 eg ese
first prepare the following table of weights of edges:

Now, we examine the A-row and pick the smallest entry 2 which corresponds to two edges
{A, B} and {A, F}. Let us choose the first of these, namely {A, B}. By examining the A- and B.
tows, we find that the vertex other than A and B which corresponds to the smallest entry is C.
Let us connect C to {A, B} at B.

Next, we examine the C-row and pick the smallest entry 1 which corresponds to edges
{C, B} and {C, F}. Since the edge {C, B} has already been chosen, let us choose the edge {C, F}.
By examining the C- and F- rows, we find that the vertex other than C and F which corresponds
to the smallest entry and which does not produce a cycle is D or E. Let us choose D and connect
Dto{C, F} at C. .

The construction at this stage shows that the edges {A, B), {B,C}, {C, F}, {C, D} belong toa
minimal tree. The vertex left over is E which is Joined to B, C, D, F in the given graph. Among
the edges that contain E, the edges EC and ED‘have equal minimum weights, 3. Therefore,
we can include either of these edges in the minimal spanning tree.

Thus, for the given graph we get two minimal spanning trees shown in Figures 4.16(a), (0)

Figure 4.16

We note that the weight of each of the above trees is 10 units
