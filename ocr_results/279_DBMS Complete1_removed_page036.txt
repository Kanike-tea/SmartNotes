LECTURE-11: CONSTRAINTS

RELATIONAL CONSTRAINTS:

There are three types of constraints on relational database that include
o DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS
o KEY CONSTRAINTS
o INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS

DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS:
It specifies that each attribute in a relation an atomic value from the corresponding domains. The
data types associated with commercial RDBMS domains include:

o Standard numeric data types for integer

o Real numbers

o Characters

o Fixed length strings and variable length strings

Thus, domain constraints specifies the condition that we to put on each instance of the relation.

So the values that appear in each column must be drawn from the domain associated with that
column.

Key Constraints:

This constraints states that the key attribute value in each tuple msut be unique .i.e, no two tuples
contain the same value for the key attribute.(null values can allowed)

Emp(empcode,name,address) . here empcode can be unique

Integrity CONSTRAINTS:

There are two types of integrity constraints:
o Entity Integrity Constraints
o Referential Integrity constraints

Entity Integrity Constraints:

It states that no primary key value can be null and unique. This is because the primary key is used to
identify individual tuple in the relation. So we will not be able to identify the records uniquely
containing null values for the primary key attributes. This constraint is specified on one individual
relation.

Referential Integrity Constraints:

It states that the tuple in one relation that refers to another relation must refer to an existing tuple in
that relation. This constraints is specified on two relations. If a column is declared as foreign key
that must be primary key of another table.

Department (deptcode, dname)
Here the deptcode is the primary key.

Emp (empcode, name, city, deptcode).
Here the deptcode is foreign key.
