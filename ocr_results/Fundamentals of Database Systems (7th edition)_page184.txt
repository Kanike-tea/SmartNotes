154 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

Ordering of Tuples in a Relation. A relation is defined as a set of tuples. Math-
ematically, elements of a set have no order among them; hence, tuples in a relation
do not have any particular order. In other words, a relation is not sensitive to the
ordering of tuples. However, in a file, records are physically stored on disk (or in
memory), so there always is an order among the records. This ordering indicates
first, second, ith, and last records in the file. Similarly, when we display a relation as
a table, the rows are displayed in a certain order.

Tuple ordering is not part of a relation definition because a relation attempts to rep-
resent facts at a logical or abstract level. Many tuple orders can be specified on the
same relation. For example, tuples in the STUDENT relation in Figure 5.1 could be
ordered by values of Name, Ssn, Age, or some other attribute. The definition of a rela-
tion does not specify any order: There is no preference for one ordering over another.
Hence, the relation displayed in Figure 5.2 is considered identical to the one shown in
Figure 5.1. When a relation is implemented as a file or displayed as a table, a particular
ordering may be specified on the records of the file or the rows of the table.

Ordering of Values within a Tuple and an Alternative Definition of a Relation.
According to the preceding definition of a relation, an n-tuple is an ordered list of n
values, so the ordering of values in a tuple—and hence of attributes in a relation
schema—is important. However, at a more abstract level, the order of attributes
and their values is not that important as long as the correspondence between attri-
butes and values is maintained.

An alternative definition of a relation can be given, making the ordering of values
ina tuple unnecessary. In this definition, a relation schema R = {A}, Ap, ..., Ay} isa
set of attributes (instead of an ordered list of attributes), and a relation state r(R) is
a finite set of mappings r = {f), t, ... , fm}, where each tuple f; is a mapping from R
to D, and D is the union (denoted by V) of the attribute domains; that is, D =
dom(A;) U dom(A2) U ... U dom(A,). In this definition, t{A;] must be in dom(A;)
for 1 <$i<n for each mapping ¢ in r. Each mapping f; is called a tuple.

According to this definition of tuple as a mapping, a tuple can be considered as a
set of (<attribute>, <value>) pairs, where each pair gives the value of the mapping
from an attribute A; to a value v; from dom(A)). The ordering of attributes is not
important, because the attribute name appears with its value. By this definition, the
