LAB PROGRAM 03 (a)

3 a) Write a Python program that accepts a sentence and find the number of words, digits,

uppercase letters and lowercase letters.

Aim: Demonstration of manipulation of strings using string methods.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION
The below program prompts the user to enter a sentence and then performs various calculations

on the input sentence. Let's go through the program step by step:

1.

The program starts by prompting the user to enter a sentence using the input() function.

The entered sentence is stored in the variable sentence.

The program calculates the number of words in the sentence by splitting the sentence into
a list of words using the split() method. The split() method separates the sentence into
words based on whitespace. The number of words is determined by taking the length of

the resulting list using len(), and it is stored in the variable word_count.

The program initializes three variables: digit_count, upper_count, and lower_count, to
keep track of the number of digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters in the

sentence. These variables are initially set to 0.

The program then iterates over each character in the sentence using a for loop. For each
character, it checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method. If it is, the digit_count
variable is incremented by 1.

Similarly, the program checks if the character is an uppercase letter using the isupper()
method, and if it is, the upper_count variable is incremented by 1.

Finally, the program checks if the character is a lowercase letter using the islower()
method, and if it is, the lower_count variable is incremented by 1.

After iterating through all the characters in the sentence, the program prints the results. It
displays the number of words, number of digits, number of uppercase letters, and number

of lowercase letters in the sentence.

The program provides a simple way to analyze a sentence and count the occurrences of words,

digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase lette

. By using built-in string methods and looping

constructs, you can perform various calculations and analysis on text data.
