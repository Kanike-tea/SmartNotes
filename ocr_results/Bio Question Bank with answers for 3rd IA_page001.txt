Sunlight is captured and directed to the bionic leaf

The bionic leaf contains a catalyst (typically a special type of bacteria or an artificial catalyst)
and a water-splitting enzyme.

Sunlight energy is used to split water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen ions (H+) and oxygen
(O2) through a process called photolysis.

The hydrogen ions (H+) generated from water splitting combine with electrons from an
external source (e.g., a wire) to form hydrogen gas (H2).

The oxygen gas (O2) produced during water splitting is released into the atmosphere.

The generated hydrogen gas (H2) can be collected and stored for later use as a clean and
renewable energy source.

The bionic leaf also absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air or a supplied source.

The absorbed carbon dioxide (CO2) is converted into carbon-based compounds, such as
formic acid or methane, through a reduction reaction.

The carbon-based compounds can be used as a fuel or converted into other useful chemicals.

The bionic leaf operates in a closed-loop system, where the produced oxygen (O2) during
water splitting is reused by the catalyst in subsequent cycles.

Applications of Bionic Leaf Technology

: Renewable Energy Production: One of the primary applications of bionic leaf
technology is in the production of renewable energy
