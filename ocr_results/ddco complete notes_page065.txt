(b) From D flip-flop

>» Characteristic tablesA characteristic table defines the logical properties ofa flip-flop by
describing its operation in tabular form. They define the next state (i.e., the state that

results from a clock transition) as a function of the inputs and the present state

> Q(t) denotes the state of the flip-flop immediately before the clock edge, and

> Q(t + 1) denotes the state that results from the clock transition.
