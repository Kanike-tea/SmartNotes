DIGITAL LOGIC GATES

>

Since Boolean functions are expressed in terms of AND, OR, and NOT operations,
it is easier to implement a Boolean function with these type of gates.

Factors to be weighed in considering the construction of other types of logic
gates are (1) the feasibility and economy of producing the gate with physical
components, (2) the possibility of extending the gate to more than two inputs, (3)
the basic properties of the binary operator, such as commutativity and
associativity, and (4) the ability of the gate to implement Boolean functions alone
or in conjunction with other gates.

The graphic symbols and truth tables of the eight gates are shown in Fig. 2.5.
Each gate has one or two binary input variables, designated by x and y, and one
binary output variable, designated by F.

The inverter circuit inverts the logic sense of a binary variable, producing the
NOT, or complement, function. The small circle in the output of the graphic
symbol of an inverter (referred to as a bubble) designates the logic complement.
The NAND function is the complement of the AND function, as indicated by a
graphic symbol that consists of an AND graphic symbol followed by a small circle.
The NOR function is the complement of the OR function and uses an OR graphic
symbol followed by a small circle.

NAND and NOR gates are used extensively as standard logic gates and are in fact

far more popular than the AND and OR gates. This is because NAND and NOR
gates are easily constructed with transistor circuits and because digital circuits
can be easily implemented with them.
The exclusive-OR gate has a graphic symbol similar to that of the OR gate,
except for the additional curved line on the input side. The equivalence, or
exclusive-NOR, gate is the complement of the exclusive-OR, as indicated by the
small circle on the output side of the graphic symbol.
