Combinational Logic
Introduction

A combinational circuit consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are determined from only the
present combination of inputs. A combinational circuit performs an operation that can be specified
logically by a set of Boolean functions.

Combinational Circuits

A combinational circuit consists of an interconnection of logic gates. Combinational logic gates react to
the values of the signals at their inputs and produce the value of the output signal, transforming binary
information from the given input data to a required output data. A block diagram of a combinational
circuit is shown in Fig. The n input binary variables come from an external source; the m output variables
are produced by the internal combinational logic circuit and go to an external destination.

Block Diagram of Combinational Circuit

For n input variables, there are 2n possible combinations of the binary inputs. For each possible input
combination, there is one possible value for each output variable. Thus, a combinational circuit can be
specified with a truth table that lists the output values for each combination of input variables. A
combinational circuit also can be described by m Boolean functions, one for each output variable. Each
output function is expressed in terms of the n input variables.

There are several combinational circuits that are employed extensively in the design of digital systems.
These circuits are available in integrated circuits and are classified as standard components. They
perform specific digital functions commonly needed in the design of digital systems.

Examples of Combinational Logic Circuits: Adders, Subtractors, Decoders, Encoders, Multipliers,
Dividers, Display Drivers, Keyboard Encoders, Etc...

Design Procedure

The design of combinational circuits starts from the specification of the design objective and culminates
in a logic circuit diagram or a set of Boolean functions from which the logic diagram can be obtained.
The procedure involves the following steps:

1. From the specifications of the circuit, determine the required number of inputs and outputs and
assign a symbol to each.

2. Derive the truth table that defines the required relationship between inputs and outputs.

3. Obtain the simplified Boolean functions for each output as a function of the input variables.

4. Draw the logic diagram and verify the correctness of the design (manually or by simulation).

A truth table for a combinational circuit consists of input columns and output columns. The input
columns are obtained from the 2n binary numbers for the n input variables. The binary values for the
outputs are determined from the stated specifications. The output functions specified in the truth table
