Advantages of array representation(static allocation)
1. Data accessing is faster: Using static allocation, we can access any data element in the array
efficiently by specifying the array index for the required element. The accessing time for a[0]
is equal to a[ 1000].
2. Array’s are simple: Arrays are very simple to understand and it is simple to use arrays in
programming.

Disadvantages of Arrays (Static allocation)
1, Array size is fixed: In static allocation method, it is required to declare in advance the amount
of memory to be utilized.
2. The array elements are stored continuously so the size of the array cannot be increased.
3. Insertion and deletion of elements in an array is expensive as more time is spent shifting the
