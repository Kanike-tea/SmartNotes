12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL

a persistent collection (extent) or by explicit naming (assigning a unique
name by which the object can be referenced/retrieved).

= Type hierarchies and inheritance. Object types can be specified by using a
type hierarchy, which allows the inheritance of both attributes and methods
(operations) of previously defined types. Multiple inheritance is allowed in
some models.

= Extents. All persistent objects of a particular class/type C can be stored in an
extent, which is a named persistent object of type set(C). Extents corre-
sponding to a type hierarchy have set/subset constraints enforced on their
collections of persistent objects.

= Polymorphism and operator overloading. Operations and method names
can be overloaded to apply to different object types with different imple-
mentations.

In the following sections we show how these concepts are realized, first in the SQL
standard (Section 12.2) and then in the ODMG standard (Section 12.3).

12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL

We introduced SQL as the standard language for RDBMSs in Chapters 6 and 7. As
we discussed, SQL was first specified by Chamberlin and Boyce (1974) and under-
went enhancements and standardization in 1989 and 1992. The language continued
its evolution with a new standard, initially called SQL3 while being developed and
later known as SQL:99 for the parts of SQL3 that were approved into the standard.
Starting with the version of SQL known as SQL3, features from object databases
were incorporated into the SQL standard. At first, these extensions were known as
SQL/Object, but later they were incorporated in the main part of SQL, known as
SQL/Foundation in SQL:2008.

The relational model with object database enhancements is sometimes referred to
as the object-relational model. Additional revisions were made to SQL in 2003 and
2006 to add features related to XML (see Chapter 13).

The following are some of the object database features that have been included in SQL:

= Some type constructors have been added to specify complex objects. These
include the row type, which corresponds to the tuple (or struct) constructor.
An array type for specifying collections is also provided. Other collection
type constructors, such as set, list, and bag constructors, were not part of the
original SQL/Object specifications in SQL:99 but were later included in the
standard in SQL:2008.

= A mechanism for specifying object identity through the use of reference
type is included.

= Encapsulation of operations is provided through the mechanism of

user-defined types (UDTs) that may include operations as part of their
declaration. These are somewhat similar to the concept of abstract data
