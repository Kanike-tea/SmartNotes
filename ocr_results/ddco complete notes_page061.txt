If D = 1, the Q output goes to 1, placing the circuit in the set state. If D = 0,

output Q goes to 0, placing the circuit in the reset state.

The graphic symbols for the various latches are shown in Fig. 5.7 . A latch is
designated by a rectangular block with inputs on the left and outputs on the
right. One output designates the normal output, and the other (with the bubble

designation) designates the complement output

STORAGE ELEMENTS : FLIP - FLOPS

» Flip-flops are fundamental building blocks in digital electronics and
sequential logic circuits.

» They are bistable multivibrators, like latches, but they are edge-

triggered and use a clock signal to control the timing of state changes.

» Flip-flops are widely used for storing binary information in electronic
systems.
