system contains the tendons which attach the muscles to the bones.

Skeletal system, whose main component is the bone. Bones articulate with each other and
form the joints, providing our bodies with a hard-core, yet mobile, skeleton. The integrity and
function of the bones and joints are supported by the accessory structures of the skeletal
system; articular cartilage, ligaments, and bursae.

13. Explain the engineering solutions for Osteoporosis and Muscular Dystrophy
Answer:

Awareness is increasing that bone morbidity due to osteoporosis is a major complication of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its treatment and that it requires monitoring for
early diagnosis and intervention to prevent clinically important sequelae.

The traditional method of fabricating 3D muscle constructs first developed more than 25
years ago involves casting myogenic cells within a cylindrically shaped collagen-I gel that is
anchored at the ends to porous felts. In this system, cell-mediated gel compaction and
remodeling result in the generation of uniaxial passive stress within the gel, which, in turn,
promotes the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes and also myotube alignment.

Alternatively, myoblasts, or mixtures of myogenic precursors and fibroblasts, can be cultured
on laminin- or hydrogel-coated dishes until spontaneous contractions of formed myotubes
detach the entire cell layer, allowing it to self- assemble into a cylindrical tissue construct
attached at the ends to premade suture anchors.

Although cell alignment within 3D constructs is not required for the formation of contractile
myotubes, it increases fusion efficiency while passive stress promotes both cell survival and
myogenesis. In addition to collagen I, different natural hydrogels and their chemically
modified derivatives can support the 3D growth and fusion of myogenic cells; the most
functional results have been achieved using fibrin-based gels. Carefully optimizing the
composition of the fibrin gel to enhance cell-matrix interactions as well as optimizing the
starting cell population to improve myogenic fusion and SC maintenance and providing
dynamic culture conditions to improve cell survival and maturation have enabled rodent
skeletal muscle tissues to be engineered with contractile properties comparable to those of
native muscle (e.g., twitch and tetanus-force amplitudes).

Rapid-prototyping techniques for hydrogel molding can be further used to vary local
myofiber alignment and to design complex muscle structures, and advanced biomaterials can
deliver angiogenic, myogenic, and pro-survival factors to cells in a spatiotemporally
controlled fashion. In addition to using biomaterial scaffolds, scaffold-free muscle tissue
constructs have been
