Architecture

The architecture of the

juman brain as a CPU system can be compared to that of a parallel

distributed processing system, as opposed to the Von Neumann architecture of traditional

computers.

In the human brain, information is processed in a distributed manner across multiple regions, each
with specialized functions, rather than being processed sequentially in a single centralized location.
Just like how a computer's CPU has an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to perform mathematical
calculations, the human brain has specialized regions for processing mathematical and logical
operations. The prefrontal cortex, for example, is responsible for higher-level cognitive functions
such as decision making and problem solving.
