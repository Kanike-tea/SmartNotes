4.1 THUMB REGISTER USAGE

In Thumb state, you do not have direct access to all registers. Only the low registers r0
to r7 are fully accessible, as shown in Table 4.2. The higher registers r8 to r12 are only
accessible with MOV, ADD, or CMP instructions. CMP and all the data processing instructions
that operate on low registers update the condition flags in the cpsr.
