= 1000 x (1 — 0.06472) = 352.8
= 353
Therefore 353 drivers out of 1000 have done more than 3 accidents in the year.

2) In a certain factory turning out razor blades there is a small probability of aw for any blade to be
defective. The blades are supplied in a packets of 10. Use poisson distribution to calculate
approximate number of packets containing,
i)No defective
ii)2 defective
iii)3 defective
in the consignment of 10000 packets.

Sol": Let X be the poisson variant follows the blades to be defective of the poisson distribution.

The probability mass function of the poisson distribution is P(X = x) = ae

Given, art = 0.002 , n=10, w = np = 0.002 x10 = 0.02 =A
-0.02 0.02)*
uP(X=x)= or
i) No blades are defective out 10000 packets = 10000 x P(x =0)
-0.02 0
e~°92(9,02)'
= 10000 x —7
= 10000 x 0.9802
= 9802
..9802 packet blades are not defective out of 10000 packets.

ii) 2 defective blades out of 10000 packets = 10000 x P(x = 2)
e992(9,92)2

= 10000 x Fl
= 10000 x 0.0002,

-.2 packets blades are 2 defective out of 10000 packets.

iii) 3 defective blades out of 10000 packets = 10000 x P(x = 3)
e~92(9,92)3
= 10000 x a
= 10000 x 0.0000.
=0
..No packets blades are 3 defective out of 10000 packets.

3) If the probability of bad reaction from a certain injection is 0.001, determine the probability that out
of 2000 individuals more than 2 will get a bad reaction.

Sol": Let X be the poisson variant follows the bad reaction of the injection.
