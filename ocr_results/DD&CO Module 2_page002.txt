The logic diagram that implements these expressions is shown in Fig below. Note that the OR gate
whose output is C + D has been used to implement partially each of three outputs. Not counting input
inverters, the implementation in sum-of-products form requires seven AND gates and three OR gates.
The implementation of Fig. requires four AND gates, four OR gates, and one inverter. Thus, the three-
level logic circuit requires fewer gates, all of which in turn require no more than two inputs.

Binary Adder — Subtractor

Digital computers perform a variety of information-processing tasks. Among the functions encountered
are the various arithmetic operations. The most basic arithmetic operation is the addition of two binary
digits. This simple addition consists of four possible elementary operations:

0+0=0,0+1=1,1+0=1,and1+1=10

The first three operations produce a sum of one digit, but when both augend and addend bits are equal
to 1, the binary sum consists of two digits. The higher significant bit of this result is called a carry. When
the augend and addend numbers contain more significant digits, the carry obtained from the addition of
two bits is added to the next higher order pair of significant bits. A combinational circuit that performs
the addition of two bits is called a half adder. One that performs the addition of three bits (two significant
bits and a previous carry) is a full adder. The names of the circuits stem from the fact that two half adders
can be employed to implement a full adder.

Half Adder

From the verbal explanation of a half adder, we find that this circuit needs two binary inputs and two
binary outputs. The input variables designate the augend and addend bits; the output variables produce
