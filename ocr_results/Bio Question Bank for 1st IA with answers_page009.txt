increasing the risk of contamination.

May clog easily: Cellulose-based water filters may clog easily when exposed to high levelsof
contaminants, reducing their filtration efficiency and requiring frequent replacement.

May affect water taste: Cellulose-based water filters may affect the taste of water by absorbing or

releasing certain chemicals or minerals, reducing the quality of the purified water.

6. What are Bioplastics? Illustrates the properties and applications of PHAs.

Ans. Bioplastics are biodegradable materials that come from renewable sources and can be used to
reduce the problem of plastic waste that is suffocating the planet and contaminating the

environment.

Properties of PHA
PHAs have several properties that make them ideal for use as bioplastics, including:

Biodegradability: PHAs are biodegradable and can break down into water and carbondioxide,
reducing their impact on the environment.

Biocompatibility: PHAs are biocompatible and can be used in medical devices, such assutures
and implants, without causing adverse reactions in the body.

Mechanical properties: PHAs have similar mechanical properties to traditional petroleum-based
plastics, making them suitable for various applications.

Processing: PHAs can be processed using conventional plastic processing techniques, suchas

injection molding, blow molding, and extrusion.

Engineering applications of PHA bioplastic

Packaging: PHA is used in various forms of packaging such as food containers, beveragecups,
and clamshell containers.

Medical Devices: PHA is biocompatible and can be used in the manufacture of medicaldevices
such as sutures, implants, and drug delivery systems.

Textiles: PHA is used in the production of biodegradable textiles, as well as for theproduction of
biodegradable composites for use in construction and furniture.

Agricultural Mulch Films: PHA is used in the production of biodegradable mulch films for
agriculture to reduce soil erosion and conserve moisture.

Consumer Goods: PHA is used in the production of various consumer goods, such as toys,phone

cases, and water bottles.
