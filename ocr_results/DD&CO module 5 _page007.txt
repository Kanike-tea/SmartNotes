FETCHING A WORD FROM MEMORY
. To fetch instruction/data from memory, processor transfers required address to MAR.
At the same time, processor issues Read signal on control-lines of memory-bus.
e When requested-data are received from memory, they are stored in MDR. From
MDR, they are transferred to other registers.
¢ The response time of each memory access varies (based on cache miss, memory-
mapped I/O). To accommodate this, MFC is used. (MFC 7] Memory Function
Completed).
¢ MFC is a signal sent from addressed-device to the processor. MFC informs the
processor that the requested operation has been completed by addressed-device.
¢ Consider the instruction Move (R1),R2. The sequence of steps is (Figure 7.5):
1) Rlout, MARin, Read ;desired address is loaded into MAR & Read command is issued.

2) MDRinE, WMFC ;load MDR from memory-bus & Wait for MFC response from
memory.
3) MDRout, R2in jload R2 from MDR.
