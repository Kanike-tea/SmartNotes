Database Management System [BCS403]

The definition of a base table or of other named schema elements can be changed by using the
ALTER command. For base tables, the possible alter table actions include adding or dropping a
column (attribute), changing a column definition, and adding or dropping table constraints.

For example, to add an attribute for keeping track of jobs of employees to the EMPLOYEE base
relation in the COMPANY schema , we can use the command:
ALTER TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE ADD COLUMN Job VARCHAR(12);

We must still enter a value for the new attribute Job for each individual EMPLOYEE tuple. This can
be done either by specifying a default clause or by using the UPDATE command individually on
each tuple. If no default clause is specified, the new attribute will have NULLs in all the tuples of the
relation immediately after the command is executed; hence, the NOT NULL constraint is not allowed
in this case.
To drop a column, we must choose either CASCADE or RESTRICT for drop behavior. If CASCADE
is chosen, all constraints and views that reference the column are dropped automatically from the
schema, along with the column. If RESTRICT is chosen, the command is successful only if no views
or constraints (or other schema elements) reference the column.
For example, the following command removes the attribute Address from the EMPLOYEE base
table:

ALTER TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE DROP COLUMN Address CASCADE;

It is also possible to alter a column definition by dropping an existing default clause or by defining a
new default clause. The following examples illustrate this clause:
ALTER TABLE COMPANY.DEPARTMENT ALTER COLUMN Mgr_ssn DROP DEFAULT;
ALTER TABLE COMPANY.DEPARTMENT ALTER COLUMN Mgr_ssn SET DEFAULT

‘333445555’;

Alter Table - Alter/Modify Column

To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name datatype;

For example we can change the data type of the column named "DateOfBirth" from date to year in
the "Persons" table using the following SQL statement:

ALTER TABLE Persons

ALTER COLUMN DateOfBirth year;
