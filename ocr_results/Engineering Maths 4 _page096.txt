“The Bessel differential equation of order is in the form,

We employ Frobenius method to solve this equation as we have,

coefficient of y” = x* = Py(x) (say) and P(x) = 0 at x = 0.

We assume the series solution of (1) in the form

We shall equate the coefficient of the lowest degree term inx, that is © to zero,
ie, (KP -n") =0.

Setting a) # 0 wehave R-n? =0 andhence k =n

Also we need to independently equate the coefficient of +! to zero.

ie, a ((k+1} = 2] =0.
