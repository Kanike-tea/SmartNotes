COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34 Module 3

. The 3 instruction program is stored in the successive memory locations of the
processor is as shown in the fig.

Address Contents

Begin execution here —e i
i+4
i+8

e The system bus consists of uni-directional address bus,bi-direetional data bus and control bus
“It is the process of accessing the 1“ instruction from memory whose address is stored in program
counter into Instruction Register (IR))by means of bi-directional data bus and at the same time
after instructiom,access the contents of PC are incremented by 4 in order to access the next
instruction. Such a\process is called as “Straight Line Sequencing”.

INSTRUCTION EXECUTION
There aré}4.steps'for instructionjexecution
1 Fetch the instruction from memory into the Instruction Register (IR) whose address
is stored in PC.
IR —[[PC]]
2 Decode the instruction.
3 Perform the operation according to the opcode of an instruction
4 Load the result into the destination.
5 During this process, Increment the contents of PC to point to next instruction ( In
32 bit machine increment by 4 address)
PC — [PC] +4.
6 The next instruction is fetched, from the address pointed by PC.

BRANCHING

Suppose a list of ,,N“ numbers have to be added. Instead of adding one after the other, the
add statement can be put in a loop. The loop is a straight-line of instructions executed as many
times as needed.
