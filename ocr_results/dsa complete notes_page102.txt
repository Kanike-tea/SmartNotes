Analysis of Search(Both iterative and recursive): If h is the height of the binary search tree, then
we can perform the search using either search in O(h). However, recursive search has an additional
stack space requirement which is O(h).

Inserting in to a Binary Search Tree: Binary search tree has distinct values, first we searchthe
tree for the key and if the search is unsuccessful the key is inserted at the point the search

terminated
Example : consider the tree given below

wo

8

35 80

BST Tree Insert 80 Insert 35

Inserting a dictionary pair into a binary search tree
If k is in the tree pointed at by node do nothing. Otherwise add a new node with data = (k, item)

TreeNode* insert(TreeNode *root, int k, int Item)

{

TreeNode * ptr, *lastnode;

lastnode=Modifiedsearch(root,k);
Ptr=(TreeNode*)malloc(sizeof(TreeNode));
ptr—data.key =k;

ptr—data.item = Item;

ptr—leftChild = ptr—rightChild = NULL;

if (toot==NULL)

{

root=ptr;

return(root);

}

if(lastnode!=NULL)

{
if (k < lastnode—data.key)
lastnode—leftChild = ptr;
else
lastnode—rightChild = ptr;
return (root);

}
