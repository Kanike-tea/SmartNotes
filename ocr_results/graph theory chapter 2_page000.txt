Chapter 2
Planar Graphs and Colouring

In this chapter, we present an elementary discussion on planar and non-planar
graphs. The so-called dual graphs associated with planar graphs are also de-
fined and illustrated. The problem of graph colouring is briefly dealt-with.

2.1 Planar and non-planar graphs

In Section 1.2, it has been indicated that a graph can be represented by more than one geomet-
rical drawing. In some drawings representing graphs, the edges intersect (cross over) at points
which are not vertices of the graph and in some others the edges meet only at the vertices.
& graph which can be represented by at least one plane drawing (drawing done on a plane
surface) in which the edges meet only at the vertices is called a planar graph.

On the other hand, a graph which cannot be represented by a plane drawing in which
the edges meet only at the vertices is called a non-planar graph; In other words, a non-planar
graph is a graph whose every possible plane drawing contains at least two edges which intersect
each other at points other than vertices,

Show that (i) a graph of order 5 and size 8, and (ii) a graph of order 6 and size
12, are planar graphs.

> A graph of order 5 and size 8 can be represented by a plane drawing in which the edges of
the graph meet only at the vertices, as shown in Figure 2.1(a). Therefore, this graph is a planar

graph,

Similarly, Figure 2.1(b) shows that a graph of order 6 and size 12 is a planar graph. .
