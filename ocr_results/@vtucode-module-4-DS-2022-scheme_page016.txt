A complete graph is a graph that has the maximum number of edges. For an
undirected graph with n vertices, the maximum number of edges is the number of dis~
tinct, unordered pairs, (v,, v)), #7. This number is:

A subgraph of G is a graph G* such that ViG) ¢ V(G) and E(G) & E(G).

A path from vertex v, to vertex v, in a graph, G, isa Sequence of vertices, ¥,. ¥,,.
Wigs "°" Mice My Such that (vy. vy). (vy. te °° 5 Gly My) are edges in an undirected
graph. If G’is a directed graph, then thepath consists of <v,,, ¥).>, <¥j,.¥),>. °°" .<¥,.
v_>. The length of a path is the number of edges on it,

A cycle is a simple path in which the first and the last vertices are the same. For
example, 0. 1, 2, 0 is a cycle in G,, and 0,1, Ois a cycle'in Gy. For directed graphs, we
usually add the prefix “directed” to the terms cycle and path,

A connected component, or simply a component, of an undirected graph is a maxi-
mal connected subgraph. For example, Gy has two components, H, and H>. A tree is a
graph that is connected and acyclic (it has no cycles).

The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to that vertex.
