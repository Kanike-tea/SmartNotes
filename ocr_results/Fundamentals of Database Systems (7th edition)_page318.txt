Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus

8.38. Specify and execute the following queries for the database in Exercise 5.16
using the RA interpreter.
a. Retrieve the names of students who have enrolled in a course that uses a
textbook published by Addison-Wesley-Longman.
b. Retrieve the names of courses in which the textbook has been changed at
least once.

c. Retrieve the names of departments that adopt textbooks published by
Addison-Wesley only.

d. Retrieve the names of departments that adopt textbooks written by
Navathe and published by Addison-Wesley.

e. Retrieve the names of students who have never used a book (in a course)
written by Navathe and published by Addison-Wesley.

8.39. Repeat Laboratory Exercises 8.34 through 8.38 in domain relational calculus
(DRC) by using the DRC interpreter.

Selected Bibliography

Codd (1970) defined the basic relational algebra. Date (1983a) discusses outer joins.
Work on extending relational operations is discussed by Carlis (1986) and Ozsoyo-
glu et al. (1985). Cammarata et al. (1989) extends the relational model integrity
constraints and joins.

Codd (1971) introduced the language Alpha, which is based on concepts of tuple
relational calculus. Alpha also includes the notion of aggregate functions, which
goes beyond relational calculus. The original formal definition of relational calculus
was given by Codd (1972), which also provided an algorithm that transforms any
tuple relational calculus expression to relational algebra. The QUEL (Stonebraker et
al., 1976) is based on tuple relational calculus, with implicit existential quantifiers,
but no universal quantifiers, and was implemented in the INGRES system as a com-
mercially available language. Codd defined relational completeness of a query lan-
guage to mean at least as powerful as relational calculus. Ullman (1988) describes a
formal proof of the equivalence of relational algebra with the safe expressions of
tuple and domain relational calculus. Abiteboul et al. (1995) and Atzeni and deAn-
tonellis (1993) give a detailed treatment of formal relational languages.

Although ideas of domain relational calculus were initially proposed in the QBE
language (Zloof, 1975), the concept was formally defined by Lacroix and Pirotte
(1977a). The experimental version of the Query-By-Example system is described in
Zloof (1975). The ILL (Lacroix & Pirotte, 1977b) is based on domain relational cal-
culus. Whang et al. (1990) extends QBE with universal quantifiers. Visual query
languages, of which QBE is an example, are being proposed as a means of querying
databases; conferences such as the Visual Database Systems Working Conference
(e.g., Arisawa & Catarci (2000) or Zhou & Pu (2002)) present a number of propos-
als for such languages.
