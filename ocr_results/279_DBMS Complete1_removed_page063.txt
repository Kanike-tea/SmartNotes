Tuple Relational Calculus

Relational algebra is an example of procedural language while tuple relational calculus is a
nonprocedural query language.

A query is specified as:

{t | P(t)}, ie it is the set of all tuples t such that predicate P is true for t.

The formula P(t) is formed using atoms which uses the relations, tuples of relations and fields of
tuples and following symbols

€( belongs to).<>, =, (comparison operators)

These atoms can then be used to form formulas with following symbols

¥ (universal qualifier generally called “for all")

3 ( existential qualifier generally called “there exists")

A (and),v (or), 7( not)

For example : here are some queries and a way to express them using tuple calculus:

o Find the branch-name, loan-number and amount for loans over Rs 1200.
{t| t€LoanAt[amount] > 1200}

o Find the loan number for each loan of an amount greater that Rs1200.
{t| 3 s € Loan(t[loan-number] = s[loan-number] A s[amount] >1200}

o Find the names of all the customers who have a loan from the Sadar branch.
{t | 4 s € Borrower ( ¢[customer-name]= s[customer-name] A
3 u € Loan ( u[loan-number] =s[loan-number
Aul[branch-name] = "Sadar"))}

o Find all customers who have a loan , an account, or both at the bank
{t| 3s € Borrower ( t[customer-name] = s[customer-name])

V 3 u€ Depositor (t[customer-name] = u[customer-name])}

o Find only those customers who have both an account and a loan.
{t| 3 s € Borrower ( t[customer-name] = s[customer-name])
Adu € Depositor (t[customer-name] = u[customer-name])}

o Find all customers who have an account but do not have loan.
{t| 3u € Depositor (t[customer-name] = u[customer-name]) A

73s € Borrower ( t[customer-name] = s[customer-name])}

o. Find all customers who have an account at all branches located in Agra
{t | Yw € Branch( w[branch-city] = "Agra" >
ds € Depositor (¢[customer-name]= s[customer-name]
Ad w€ Account ( u[account-number] = s[account-number]

Au[branch-name] = w[branch-name])))}
