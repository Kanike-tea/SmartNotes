LAB PROGRAM 08 (a)

8 a) Write a Python program to explain working with bokeh line graph using Annotations

and Legends.

Aim: Demonstration of working with bokeh line graph using Annotations and Legends.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

Bokeh is a Python library for interactive data visualization. It provides various types of plots and
charts, such as line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and more. To create different types of plots
using Bokeh, you first need to install the library:

pip install bokeh

Here's a Python program that demonstrates how to create different types of plots using Bokeh:
The provided Python program uses the Bokeh library to create a line graph with annotations and
legends. Below is an explanation of the program step by step:

1. Import necessary modules from Bokeh:

e figure: Used to create the main plotting figure.

¢ output_file: Used to specify the HTML output file where the plot will be saved.
e show: Used to display the plot in a web browser.

e Legend, LegendItem: Used to create a legend for the plot.

¢ Title: Used to set the title for the plot.

e Span: Used to add a vertical line annotation.

2. Specify the output file: This line tells Bokeh to generate an HTML file called
"line_graph_with_annotations.html" where the plot will be saved.

3. Define sample data: Here, you have two sets of data for the x and y coordinates,
represented as x, yl, and y2.

4. Create a Bokeh figure: This line creates a Bokeh figure named p with a title, X-axis label,
and Y-axis label.

5. Add lines to the figure: This code adds two lines to the figure using the line method. It
specifies the data (x, yl, and y2), line width, and line colors. The legend_label parameter
assigns labels for each line, which will be used in the legend.

6. Add an annotation (vertical line) using a Span: This code creates a vertical line at x=3
using the Span model and adds it to the figure p. The location parameter specifies where

the line should be located along the x-axis.
