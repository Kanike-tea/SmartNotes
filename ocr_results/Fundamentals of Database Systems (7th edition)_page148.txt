Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

4. Students are further classified as either graduate or undergraduate, with
the specific attributes degree program (M.S., Ph.D., M.B.A., and so on)
for graduate students and class (freshman, sophomore, and so on) for
undergraduates.

In Figure 4.7, all person entities represented in the database are members of
the PERSON entity type, which is specialized into the subclasses (EMPLOYEE,
ALUMNUS, STUDENT}. This specialization is overlapping; for example, an alum-
nus may also be an employee and a student pursuing an advanced degree. The
subclass STUDENT is the superclass for the specialization {GRADUATE_STUDENT,
UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT}, whereas EMPLOYEE is the superclass for the
specialization {STUDENT_ASSISTANT, FACULTY, STAFF}. Notice that
STUDENT_ASSISTANT is also a subclass of STUDENT. Finally, STUDENT_ASSISTANT
is the superclass for the specialization into {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT,
TEACHING_ASSISTANT}.

In such a specialization lattice or hierarchy, a subclass inherits the attributes not
only of its direct superclass, but also of all its predecessor superclasses all the way to
the root of the hierarchy or lattice if necessary. For example, an entity in
GRADUATE_STUDENT inherits all the attributes of that entity as a STUDENT and asa
PERSON. Notice that an entity may exist in several leaf nodes of the hierarchy,
where a leaf node is a class that has no subclasses of its own. For example, a member
of GRADUATE_STUDENT may also be a member of RESEARCH_ASSISTANT.

A subclass with more than one superclass is called a shared subclass, such as
ENGINEERING MANAGER in Figure 4.6. This leads to the concept known as
multiple inheritance, where the shared subclass ENGINEERING_MANAGER
directly inherits attributes and relationships from multiple superclasses. Notice
that the existence of at least one shared subclass leads to a lattice (and hence to
multiple inheritance); if no shared subclasses existed, we would have a hierarchy
rather than a lattice and only single inheritance would exist. An important rule
related to multiple inheritance can be illustrated by the example of the shared
subclass STUDENT_ASSISTANT in Figure 4.7, which inherits attributes from
both EMPLOYEE and STUDENT. Here, both EMPLOYEE and STUDENT inherit the
same attributes from PERSON. The rule states that if an attribute (or relation-
ship) originating in the same superclass (PERSON) is inherited more than once
via different paths (EMPLOYEE and STUDENT) in the lattice, then it should be
included only once in the shared subclass (STUDENT_ASSISTANT). Hence, the
attributes of PERSON are inherited only once in the STUDENT_ASSISTANT sub-
class in Figure 4.7.

It is important to note here that some models and languages are limited to single
inheritance and do not allow multiple inheritance (shared subclasses). It is also
important to note that some models do not allow an entity to have multiple
types, and hence an entity can be a member of only one leaf class.* In such a
model, it is necessary to create additional subclasses as leaf nodes to cover all

8In some models, the class is further restricted to be a leaf node in the hierarchy or lattice.
