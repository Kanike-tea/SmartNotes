The process of removing polluting heavy metals using bioremediation or
biomining via microbial surface adsorption

Identification of heavy metal-contaminated site:

Identify the site or area contaminated with heavy metals, such as soil, water, or industrial waste
sites.

J
Isolation and characterization of metal-resistant microbial strains:

Select and isolate microbial strains that have demonstrated resistance to heavy metals. These can
include bacteria, fungi, or archaea.

J
Culturing and enrichment of microbial strains:

Culture and propagate the selected microbial strains in a suitable growth medium under
laboratory conditions. This step aims to obtain a sufficient quantity of active microbial biomass
for subsequent applications.

J

Preparation of microbial suspension:

Harvest the microbial biomass and prepare a suspension by suspending the biomass in a carrier
solution, such as water or a nutrient broth. This suspension will serve as the delivery system for
the microbes during application.

J
Application of microbial suspension to the contaminated site:

Apply the microbial suspension to the heavy metal-contaminated area. This can be done through
spraying, injection, or soil/water mixing, depending on the specific site conditions.

J
Microbial adsorption and sequestration of metal:

The applied microbial strains adsorb to the surfaces of metal particles or form biofilms. Through
their metabolic activity, the microbes produce extracellular compounds such as organic acids or
biofilm matrix components that have an affinity for binding metal ions.

Separation or removal of metals from the contaminated site can be achieved through
