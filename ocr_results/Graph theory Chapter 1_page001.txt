3 1. Directed Graphs and Graphs

[ Definition of a Directed graph ; : ;
A directed graph (or a digraph) is a pair (V.E), where V is a nonempty set and E is a set _
of ordered pairs of elements taken from the set V. é
For a directed graph (V, E), the elements of V are called vertices (points or nodes) and the j
elements of E are called directed edges. The set V is called the vertex set and the set E is called
For brevity in terminology, a directed edge is often referred to as just an “edge”. Similarly,
the directed edge set is referred to as the “edge set.”
The directed graph (V, E) is also denoted D = (V, E), or D = D(V.E), or just D when there
is no ambiguity.
A geometrical figure that depicts a directed graph is called a diagram of the directed graph.
Thus, Figure 1.1 is a diagram of the directed graph for which the vertex set is

V = {A, B,C, D}

E = (AB. CD, CA} = {(A, B), (C, D), (C.A)}.

Figure 1.2 depicts the directed graph for which the vertex set is V = {A, B,C, D} and the
edge set is E = {AB, CD, AC} = {(A, B),(C, D), (A, O}-
