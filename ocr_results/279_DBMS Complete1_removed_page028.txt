LECTURE-9: Record Based Logical Model

Hierarchical Model:
e A hierarchical database consists of a collection of records which are connected to one
another through links.
e Arecord is a collection of fields, each of which contains only one data value.
e A link is an association between precisely two records.
e The hierarchical model differs from the network model in that the records are organized as
collections of trees rather than as arbitrary graphs.

Tree-Structure Diagrams:
e The schema for a hierarchical database consists of
© boxes, which correspond to record types
© lines, which correspond to links
¢ Record types are organized in the form of a rooted tree.
o No cycles in the underlying graph.
© Relationships formed in the graph must be such that only
one-to-many or one-to-one relationships exist between a parent and a child.

Database schema is represented as a collection of tree-structure diagrams.
= single instance of a database tree
= The root of this tree is a dummy node
= The children of that node are actual instances of the appropriate record type

When transforming E-R diagrams to corresponding tree-structure diagrams, we must ensure that the
resulting diagrams are in the form of rooted trees.

Single Relationships:
= Example of E-R diagram with two entity sets, customer and account, related through a
binary, one-to-many relationship depositor.

= Corresponding tree-structure diagram has

o the record type customer with three fields: customer-name, customer-street, and
customer-city.

othe record type account with two fields: account-number and balance
othe link depositor, with an arrow pointing to customer

= Ifthe relationship depositor is one to one, then the link depositor has two arrows.

customer-namte | customer-street | customer-city customer

|

account-number | balance account

= Only one-to-many and one-to-one relationships can be directly represented in the
hierarchical mode.

Transforming Many-To-Many Relationships:
