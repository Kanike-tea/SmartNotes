This representation can be used for any binary tree. In most cases there will be a lot of unutilized
spaces. For complete binary tree such as

Linked Representation
Disadvantage of array representation
e The array representation is good for complete binary trees but, it wastes a lot of space for
many other binary trees.
e Insertion and deletion of nodes from the middle of a tree require the movement of potentially
many nodes to reflect the change in level number of these nodes.
¢ These problems can be overcome easily through the use of a linked representation.

Each node has three fields, leftChild, data, and rightChild.
A node can be defined as:
struct node

{
int data;
struct node * leftChild;
struct node * rightChild;

a
