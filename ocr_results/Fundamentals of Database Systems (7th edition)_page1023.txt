26.3 Spatial Database Concepts

A join index can be described by a bipartite graph G = (Vj, V2, E), where V, contains
the tuple ids of relation R and V3 contains the tuple ids of relation S. Edge set con-
tains an edge (1, v,) for v, in R and v, in S, if there is a tuple corresponding to (v, , vs)
in the join index. The bipartite graph models all of the related tuples as connected
vertices in the graphs. Spatial join indexes are used in operations (see Section 26.3.3)
that involve computation of relationships among spatial objects.

26.3.5 Spatial Data Mining

Spatial data tends to be highly correlated. For example, people with similar charac-
teristics, occupations, and backgrounds tend to cluster together in the same neigh-
borhoods. The three major spatial data mining techniques are spatial classification,
spatial association, and spatial clustering.

= Spatial classification. The goal of classification is to estimate the value of an
attribute of a relation based on the value of the relation’s other attributes. An
example of the spatial classification problem is determining the locations of
nests in a wetland based on the value of other attributes (for example, vege-
tation durability and water depth); it is also called the location prediction
problem. Similarly, where to expect hotspots in crime activity is also a loca-
tion prediction problem.

= Spatial association. Spatial association rules are defined in terms of spatial
predicates rather than items. A spatial association rule is of the form

PLAPIA... A Py S>QaQ a... AQn

where at least one of the Ps or Q's is a spatial predicate. For example, the
rule

is_a(x, country) ~ touches(x, Mediterranean) => is_a (x, wine-exporter)

(that is, a country that is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea is typically a wine
exporter) is an example of an association rule, which will have a certain sup-
port s and confidence c.””

Spatial colocation rules attempt to generalize association rules to point to collec-
tion data sets that are indexed by space. There are several crucial differences
between spatial and nonspatial associations, including the following:

1. The notion of a transaction is absent in spatial situations, since data is
embedded in continuous space. Partitioning space into transactions would
lead to an overestimate or an underestimate of interest measures, for exam-
ple, support or confidence.

2. Size of item sets in spatial databases is small, that is, there are many fewer
items in the item set in a spatial situation than in a nonspatial situation.

27Concepts of support and confidence for association rules are discussed as part of data mining in
Section 28.2.
