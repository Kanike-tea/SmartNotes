11.2.4.1 Reset Exception

The reset vector is only called once during the initialization phase. In theory, it could
be called again to reinitialize the system—for example, in response to a watchdog timer
event resetting the processor. Watchdog timers are used to reset a system when prolonged
inactivity occurs.

11.2.4.2 SWI Exception

Whenever a device driver is called from an application, the call goes through the SWI handler
mechanism. The SWI instruction forces the processor to change from user to SVC mode.
