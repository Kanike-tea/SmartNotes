Imaging of organ or segment of interest
(i.e. CT, MRI)

Segmentation - creation of 3D geometry of

the area of interest

Transformation of 3D geometry - shape to a
file ready for printing

(i.e. from DICOM to STL)

Selection of appropriate 3D (bio) printer

J
oN Selection of material(s) for the 3D

fabrication of the object

Creation of 3D printed object, post-

processing and testing of object's surface,
properties etc.

Bio- Ink Materials:

* Protein based bio-ink

* Synthetic polymers

*  Decellularized ECM (Extra Cellular Matrix)

+ Hydro gel based bio-inks(Hydrogels are attractive materials for bio printing, Because
they are enormous three dimensional network of polymer chains holding a mass of
water)
