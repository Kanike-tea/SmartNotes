to develop skin tissue that can repair severe burns or other injuries by tissue grafting.

2. Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease: A team of researchers have developed blood vessels
in mice using human stem cells. Within two weeks of implantation, the blood vessels forme

their network and were as efficient as the natural vessels.

3. Treatment of Brain Diseases: Stem cells can also treat diseases such as Parkinson’s disease
and Alzheimer’s. These can help to replenish the damaged brain cells. Researchers have
tried to differentiate embryonic stem cells into these types of cells and make it possible to

treat diseases.

4. Blood Disease Treatment: The adult hematopoietic stem cells are used to treat cancers,
sickle cell anaemia, and other immunodeficiency diseases. These stem cells can be used to

produce red blood cells and white blood cells in the body.

5. What are the key properties, advantages and limitations of cellulose - based water filter.
Ans. Cellulose-based water filters are filters made from cellulose, a carbohydrate polymer
found in plant cell walls. They are used to remove impurities and contaminants from water and

are an alternative to traditional synthetic polymer filters.

Properties of cellulose-based water filter

Cellulose-based water filters have several properties that make them an attractive choicefor

water filtration:

e High Porosity: Cellulose-based water filters have a high porosity structure, which allows them to

efficiently remove impurities and contaminants from water.

e Biodegradability: Cellulose-based water filters are made from a biodegradable material, cellulose,

which reduces their impact on the environment compared to synthetic polymer filters.

¢ Cost-effective: Cellulose-based water filters are often more affordable than traditional synthetic

polymer filters, making them accessible to a wider range of consumers and communities.

e Renewable resource: Cellulose-based water filters are made from a renewable resource, cellulose,

reducing the dependency on non-renewable resources.

¢ Good mechanical strength: Cellulose-based water filters have good mechanical strength, allowing

them to maintain their structure and perform effectively over time.

e Chemical resistance: Cellulose-based water filters are resistant to most chemicals, includingacids
