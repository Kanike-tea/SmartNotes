CONTROL-SIGNALS OF MDR
«The MDR register has 4 control-signals (Figure 7.4):

1) MDRin & MDRout control the connection to the internal processor data bus
&

2) MDRinE & MDRoutE control the connection to the external memory Data
bus.
Similarly, MAR register has 2 control-signals.

1) MARin: controls the connection to the internal processor address bus &

2) MARout: controls the connection to the memory address bus.

The response time of each memory access varies. To accommodate this

MFC is used(MEC> Memory Function Completed)

MFC=1 indicatethat conte lecation™have been read and are

available on (he"data lines of th mory bus.

1, MAR < {Ri}

2. Start a Read operation on the memory bus

3. Wait for the MFC response from the memory
4. Load MDR ‘fromthe memory Dus

5. R2< [MDR]

The sequence of steps is (Figure 7.5):
1) Rlout, MARin,Read ;desired address is loaded into MAR & Read command is
issued.
2) MDRinge,WMFC; load MDR from memory-bus & Wait for MFC response
from memory.
3) MDRout, R2in;load R2 from MDR.
