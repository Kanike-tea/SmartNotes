e Hydrophilic acrylic: Hydrophilic acrylic is a type of acrylic material that is designed to be
more compatible with the natural fluid in the eye, reducing the risk of vision-threatening
complications.

The choice of lens material will depend on several factors, including the patient's individual
needs, the surgeon's preference, and the potential risks and benefits of each material. Your eye
doctor can provide guidance on which lens material may be best for you.

Bionic Eye or Artificial Eye

A bionic eye, also known as a retinal implant, is a type of prosthetic device that is surgically
implanted into the eye to help restore vision to people who have lost their sight due to certain
conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration.

The device typically consists of a camera, a processor, and an electrode array that is attached to
the retina. The camera captures images and sends signals to the processor, which the transmits
electrical stimulation to the electrodes in the retina to stimulate the remaining healthy cells and
restore vision. The restored vision is not perfect, but it can help people with vision loss to perform
daily tasks more easily and safely.

Materials Used in Bionic Eye
The materials used in a bionic eye can vary depending on the specific device and manufacturer.
However, some of the common materials used in bionic eye technology include:
e Silicon or other semiconducting materials for the camera and the electrode array.
« Biocompatible materials for the casing of the device and the electrode array, such a
titanium or titanium alloys, to minimize the risk of infection and rejection by the body.
« Conductive materials, such as platinum, iridium, or gold, for the electrodes in the array to
provide efficient electrical stimulation to the retina.
e Polymers, such as silicone or polyimide, for insulation and protection of the electrodes and
other components.
