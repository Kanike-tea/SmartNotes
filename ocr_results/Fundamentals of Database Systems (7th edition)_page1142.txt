1112 Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP

for loads as well as methods to recover from incomplete or incorrect loads
are required. With the huge volume of data in the warehouse, incremental
updating is usually the only feasible approach. The refresh policy will prob-
ably emerge as a compromise that takes into account the answers to the fol-
lowing questions:

© How up-to-date must the data be?

Can the warehouse go offline, and for how long?
What are the data interdependencies?

What is the storage availability?

What are the distribution requirements (such as for replication and parti-
tioning)?

| What is the loading time (including cleaning, formatting, copying, trans-
mitting, and overhead such as index rebuilding)?

Data in a warehouse can come from multiple sources, geographies, and/or time
zones. Data loads, therefore, need to be carefully planned and staged. The order
in which data is loaded into the warehouse is critical; failure to load data in the
correct order could lead to integrity constraints or semantic rule violations, both
of which could cause load failures. For example, master data (whether new or
changed) such as Customer and Product must be loaded prior to the transactions
that contain them; and invoice data must be loaded before the billing data that
references it.

As we have said, databases must strike a balance between efficiency in transaction
processing and support for query requirements (ad hoc user requests), but a data
warehouse is typically optimized for access from a decision maker’s needs. Data
storage in a data warehouse reflects this specialization and involves the following
processes:

Storing the data according to the data model of the warehouse

Creating and maintaining required data structures

Creating and maintaining appropriate access paths

Providing for time-variant data as new data are added

Supporting the updating of warehouse data

Refreshing the data

Purging data

Although adequate time can be devoted initially to constructing the warehouse, the
sheer volume of data in the warehouse generally makes it impossible to simply
reload the warehouse in its entirety later on. Alternatives include selective (partial)
refreshing of data and separate warehouse versions (which requires double storage
capacity for the warehouse). When the warehouse uses an incremental data refresh-
ing mechanism, data may need to be purged periodically; for example, a warehouse
that maintains data on the previous twelve business quarters may periodically purge
its data each year, or even each quarter.
