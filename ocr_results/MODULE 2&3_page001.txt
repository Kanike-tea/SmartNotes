1. Introduction

Different ARM architecture revisions support different instructions. Code written for

architecture ARMV4T should execute on an ARMYSTE processor.

Table! provides complete list of ARM instructions available in the ARMVSE instruction set

architecture (ISA). This ISA includes all the core ARM instructions as well as some of the

newer features in the ARM instruction set.

Table 1: ARM Instruction Set

Mnemonics ARM ISA Description
ADC vi add two 32-bit values and carry

ADD vi add two 32-bit values

AND vi logical bitwise AND of two 32-bit values

B vi branch relative +/— 32 MB

BIC vi logical bit clear (AND NOT) of two 32-bit values

BKPT v5 breakpoint instructions

BL vi relative branch with link

BLX v5 branch with link and exchange

BX v4T branch with exchange

MLA v2 multiply and accumulate 32-bit values

MOV vi move a 32-bit value into a register

MRC MRC2 MRRC v2vSvSE move to ARM register or registers from a coprocessor

MRS v3 move to ARM register from a status register (cpsr or spsr)
MSR v3 move to a status register (cpsr or spsr) from an ARM register
MUL v2 multiply two 32-bit values

MVN vl move the logical NOT of 32-bit value into a register

ORR vi logical bitwise OR of two 32-bit values

PLD vSE preload hint instruction

QADD VSE signed saturated 32-bit add

‘SMLAL v3M signed multiply accumulate long ((32 x 32) + 64 = 64-bit)
SMLALXy vSE signed multiply accumulate long (16 x 16) + 64 = 64-bit)
SMLAMy VSE signed multiply accumulate instruction (((32 x 16) > 16) + 32 = 32-bit)
