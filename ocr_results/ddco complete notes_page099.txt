MODULE 4
INPUT /OUTPUT ORGANIZATION

There are a number of input/output (I/O) devices, that can be connected to a
computer. The input maybe from a keyboard, a sensor, switch, mouse etc. Similarly
output may be a speaker, monitor, printer, a digital display etc.

These variety of I/O devices exchange information in varied format, having different
word length, transfer speed is different, but are connected to the same system and
exchange information with the same computer. Computer must be capable of handling
these wide variety of devices.

ACCESSING I/O-DEVICES

A single bus-structure can be used for connecting I/O-devices to a computer. The
simple arrangement of connecting set of I/O devices to memory and processor by
means of system bus is as shown in the figure. Such an arrangement is called as Single

Bus Organization.
