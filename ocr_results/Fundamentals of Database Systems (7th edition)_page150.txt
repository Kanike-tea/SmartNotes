Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

notion of representing data and knowledge by using superclass/subclass hierar-
chies and lattices is quite common in knowledge-based systems and expert sys-
tems, which combine database technology with artificial intelligence techniques.
For example, frame-based knowledge representation schemes closely resemble
class hierarchies. Specialization is also common in software engineering design
methodologies that are based on the object-oriented paradigm.

4.4 Modeling of UNION Types
Using Categories

It is sometimes necessary to represent a collection of entities from different entity
types. In this case, a subclass will represent a collection of entities that is a subset of
the UNION of entities from distinct entity types; we call such a subclass a union type
ora category.”

For example, suppose that we have three entity types: PERSON, BANK, and
COMPANY. In a database for motor vehicle registration, an owner of a vehicle can
be a person, a bank (holding a lien on a vehicle), or a company. We need to create
a class (collection of entities) that includes entities of all three types to play the
role of vehicle owner. A category (union type) OWNER that is a subclass of the
UNION of the three entity sets of COMPANY, BANK, and PERSON can be created
for this purpose. We display categories in an EER diagram as shown in Figure 4.8.
The superclasses COMPANY, BANK, and PERSON are connected to the circle with
the U symbol, which stands for the set union operation. An arc with the subset
symbol connects the circle to the (subclass) OWNER category. In Figure 4.8 we
have two categories: OWNER, which is a subclass (subset) of the union of PERSON,
BANK, and COMPANY; and REGISTERED_VEHICLE, which is a subclass (subset) of
the union of CAR and TRUCK.

A category has two or more superclasses that may represent collections of enti-
ties from distinct entity types, whereas other superclass/subclass relationships
always have a single superclass. To better understand the difference,
we can compare a category, such as OWNER in Figure 4.8, with the
ENGINEERING_MANAGER shared subclass in Figure 4.6. The latter is a subclass of
each of the three superclasses ENGINEER, MANAGER, and SALARIED_EMPLOYEE,
so an entity that is a member of ENGINEERING_MANAGER must exist in all
three collections. This represents the constraint that an engineering manager must
be an ENGINEER, a MANAGER, and a SALARIED_EMPLOYEE; that is, the
ENGINEERING MANAGER entity set is a subset of the intersection of the three
entity sets. On the other hand, a category is a subset of the union of its super-
classes. Hence, an entity that is a member of OWNER must exist in only one of the
superclasses. This represents the constraint that an OWNER may be a COMPANY,
a BANK, or a PERSON in Figure 4.8.

®Our use of the term category is based on the ECR (entity-category-relationship) model (Elmasri et al,
1985).
