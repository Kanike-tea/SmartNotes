stores data records of the same type.* The STUDENT file stores data on each stu-
dent, the COURSE file stores data on each course, the SECTION file stores data on
each section of a course, the GRADE_REPORT file stores the grades that students
receive in the various sections they have completed, and the PREREQUISITE file
stores the prerequisites of each course.

To define this database, we must specify the structure of the records of each file by
specifying the different types of data elements to be stored in each record. In
Figure 1.2, each STUDENT record includes data to represent the student’s Name,
Student_number, Class (such as freshman or ‘1’, sophomore or ‘2’, and so forth),
and Major (such as mathematics or ‘MATH’ and computer science or CS’); each
COURSE record includes data to represent the Course_name, Course_number,
Credit_hours, and Department (the department that offers the course), and so
on. We must also specify a data type for each data element within a record. For
example, we can specify that Name of STUDENT is a string of alphabetic characters,
Student_number of STUDENT is an integer, and Grade of GRADE_REPORT is a

3We use the term file informally here. At a conceptual level, a file is a collection of records that may or
may not be ordered.
