Theorem 3. In the complete graph with n vertices, where n is an odd number > 3, there are
4(n = 1) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.
Proof: Let G be a complete graph with n vertices, where n is odd and > 3. Denote the vertices
of G by 1,2,3,...,m and represent them as points as shown in Figure 1.134. * :

We note that the polygonal pattern of edges from vertex 1 to vertex n as depicted in
1.134 is a cycle that includes all the vertices of G. This cycle is therefore a Hamilton
This representation demonstrates that G has at least one Hamilton cycle. :

Now, rotate the polygonal pattern clockwise by a1, a2, @3,..,,a% degrees, where
