DESIGN OF FAST ADDERS
¢ Drawback of ripple carry adder: If the adder is used to implement the addition/subtraction, all
sum bits are available in 2n gate delays.
© Two approaches can be used to reduce delay in adders:
1) Use the fastest possible electronic-technology in implementing the ripple-carry design.
2) Use an augmented logic-gate network structure.

CARR Y-LOOKAHEAD ADDITIONS
© The logic expression for si(sum) and ci+1(carry-out) of stage i are
Si=Xit+yitci (1) ci+1=xiyi+xicit+yici---------- (2)
* Factoring (2) into
ci+1=xiyit+
(xi+yi)ci we can write
cit 1=GitPiCi where Gi=xiyi and Pi=xi+yi
© The expressions Gi and Pj are called generate and propagate functions (Figure 9.4).
If Gi=1, then ci+1=1, independent of the input carry ci. This occurs when both xi and yi are 1. Propagate
function means that an input-carry will produce an output-carry when either xi=1 or yi=1.
All Gi and Pi functions can be formed independently and in parallel in one logic-gate delay.
¢ Expanding ci terms of i-1 subscripted variables and substituting into the ci+1 expression, we obtain
ci+1=GitPiGi-1+PiPi-1Gi-2. .... - +P1G0+PiPi-1 POcO
* Conclusion: Delay through the adder is 3 gate delays for all carry-bits &4
gate delays for all sum-bits.
© Consider the design of a 4-bit adder. The carries can be implemented as
c1=G0+P0cO
¢2=G1+P1G0+P1P0cO
c3=G2+P2G1+P2P1G0+P2P1P0c0
c4=G3+P3G2+P3P2G1+P3P2P1G0
+P3P2P1P0c0
© The carries are implemented in the block labeled carry-lookahead logic. An adder implemented in this
form is called a Carry-Lookahead Adder.
¢ Limitation: If we try to extend the carry-lookahead adder for longer operands, we run into a problem of
gate fan-in constraints.
