NOSQL Databases
and Big Data Storage Systems

W: now turn our attention to the class of sys-
tems developed to manage large amounts of
data in organizations such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter and in
applications such as social media, Web links, user profiles, marketing and sales,
posts and tweets, road maps and spatial data, and e-mail. The term NOSQL is
generally interpreted as Not Only SQL—rather than NO to SQL—and is meant
to convey that many applications need systems other than traditional relational
SQL systems to augment their data management needs. Most NOSQL systems
are distributed databases or distributed storage systems, with a focus on semis-
tructured data storage, high performance, availability, data replication, and scal-
ability as opposed to an emphasis on immediate data consistency, powerful
query languages, and structured data storage.

We start in Section 24.1 with an introduction to NOSQL systems, their character-
istics, and how they differ from SQL systems. We also describe four general cate-
gories of NOSQL systems—document-based, key-value stores, column-based,
and graph-based. Section 24.2 discusses how NOSQL systems approach the issue
of consistency among multiple replicas (copies) by using the paradigm known as
eventual consistency. We discuss the CAP theorem, which can be used to under-
stand the emphasis of NOSQL systems on availability. In Sections 24.3 through
24.6, we present an overview of each category of NOSQL systems—starting with
document-based systems, followed by key-value stores, then column-based, and
finally graph-based. Some systems may not fall neatly into a single category, but
rather use techniques that span two or more categories of NOSQL systems.
Finally, Section 24.7 is the chapter summary.
