based on gender ("sex"). The data source is the "tips" dataset, and the ax parameter
specifies the axis object to use.

Add Labels and a Title: ax.set_xlabel(), ax.set_ylabel(), and ax.set_title() are used to add
labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and a title to the plot.

Customize the Legend: ax.legend(title="Gender") adds a legend to the plot with the title
"Gender."

Optional: Save the Plot to a File: plt.savefig("customized_seaborn_plot.png") saves the
plot to a file named "customized_seaborn_plot.png" in the current directory. This step is
optional.

Show the Plot: plt.show() is called to display the customized violin plot in a graphical

window.

When you run this program, it will generate a violin plot with various customizations. The plot

will have a "whitegrid" style, a specific color palette, increased font size, a customized context,

labels,

a title, and a legend. This program demonstrates how to use Seaborn's aesthetic functions

to create a customized and visually appealing violin plot.

PROGRAM
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a sample dataset

tips

= sns.load_dataset ("tips")

# Set the style of the plot
sns.set (style="whitegrid")

# Create a customized bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot (x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips, palette="Blues_d")

# Customize labels and titles

plt.xlabel ("Day of the week", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel ("Total Bill ($)", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Total Bill Amounts by Day", fontsize=14)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
