Database Management System [BCS403]

If the names of the join attributes are not the same in the base relations, it is possible to rename the
attributes so that they match, and then to apply NATURAL JOIN. In this case, the AS construct can
be used to rename a relation and all its attributes in the FROM clause.

CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of rows from tables in the join. In other words, it will
produce rows which combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table.

OUTER JOIN
An outer join does not require each record in the two joined tables to have a matching record. The
joined table retains each record-even if no other matching record exists. Outer joins subdivide
further into

+ — Left outer joins

+ — Right outer joins

+ Full outer joins
No implicit join-notation for outer joins exists in standard SQL.

» LEFT OUTER JOIN

Every tuple in left table must appear in result

If no matching tuple
Padded with NULL values for attributes of right table

only employees who have a

If the user requires that all
employees be included, an

088 ee E.Lname AS Employee_name, OUTER JOIN must be used
S.Lname AS Supervisor_name explicitly
