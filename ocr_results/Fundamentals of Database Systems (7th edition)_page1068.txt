indexes, thereby reducing the size of an index structure by about 40% or more. How-
ever, doing so could impact the recall if the stopword is an integral part of a query
(for example, a search for the phrase ‘To be or not to be’, where removal of stop-
words makes the query inappropriate, as all the words in the phrase are stopwords).
Many search engines do not employ query stopword removal for this reason.

27.4.2 Stemming

A stem of a word is defined as the word obtained after trimming the suffix and pre-
fix of an original word. For example, ‘comput’ is the stem word for computer, com-
puting, computable, and computation. These suffixes and prefixes are very common
in the English language for supporting the notion of verbs, tenses, and plural forms.
Stemming reduces the different forms of the word formed by inflection (due to
plurals or tenses) and derivation to a common stem.

A stemming algorithm can be applied to reduce any word to its stem. In English,
the most famous stemming algorithm is Martin Porter’s stemming algorithm. The
Porter stemmer”’ is a simplified version of Lovin’s technique that uses a reduced set
of about 60 rules (from 260 suffix patterns in Lovin’s technique) and organizes
them into sets; conflicts within one subset of rules are resolved before going on to
the next. Using stemming for preprocessing data results in a decrease in the size of
the indexing structure and an increase in recall, possibly at the cost of precision.

27.4.3 Utilizing a Thesaurus

A thesaurus comprises a precompiled list of important concepts and the main
word that describes each concept for a particular domain of knowledge. For each
concept in this list, a set of synonyms and related words is also compiled.”! Thus, a
synonym can be converted to its matching concept during preprocessing. This pre-
processing step assists in providing a standard vocabulary for indexing and search-
ing. Usage of a thesaurus, also known as a collection of synonyms, has a substantial
impact on the recall of information systems. This process can be complicated
because many words have different meanings in different contexts.

UMLS” is a large biomedical thesaurus of millions of concepts (called the meta-
thesaurus) and a semantic network of meta concepts and relationships that organize
the metathesaurus (see Figure 27.3). The concepts are assigned labels from the
semantic network. This thesaurus of concepts contains synonyms of medical
terms, hierarchies of broader and narrower terms, and other relationships among
words and concepts that make it a very extensive resource for information retrieval
of documents in the medical domain. Figure 27.3 illustrates part of the UMLS
Semantic Network.
