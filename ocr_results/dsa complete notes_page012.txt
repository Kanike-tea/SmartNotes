Array Operations: Operations that can be performed on any linear structure whether it is
anarray or a linked list include the following

Traversal- processing each element in the list

Search- Finding the location of the element with a given key.

Insertion- Adding a new element to the list

Deletion- Removing an element from the list.

Sorting- Arranging the elements in some type of order.

Merging- combining two list into a single list.

Traversing WinearArrays: Traversing an array is accessing and processing each element exactly
once. Considering the processing applied during traversal as display of elements the array can be
traversed as follows

void displayarray(int a[])

{

int i;

printf("The Array Elements are:\n");
for(i=0;i<n;i++)

printf("%d\t" a[i});

Insertion

e Inserting an element at the end of the array can be done provided the memory space allocated
for the array is large enough to accommodate the additional element.

e  Ifan element needs to be inserted in the middle then all the elements form the specified position
to the end of the array should be moved down wards to accommodate the new element and to
keep the order of the other element.

e The following function inserts an element at the specified position

void insertelement(int item, int pos int *n, int a[],)
{
int i;
if (pos<0 II pos>n)
printf("Invalid Position\n");
