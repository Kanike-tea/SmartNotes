SIMULTANEOUS REQUESTS
© The processor must have some mechanisms to decide which request to service when simultaneous
requests arrive.
¢ INTR line is common to all devices (Figure 4.8a).
¢ INTA line is connected in a daisy-chain fashion.
¢ INTA signal propagates serially through devices.
* When several devices raise an interrupt-request, INTR line is activated.
Processor responds by setting INTA line to 1. This signal is received by device 1.
* Device-1 passes signal on to device 2 only if it does not require any service.
¢ If device-1 has a pending-request for interrupt, the device-1
— blocks INTA signal &
— proceeds to put its identifying-code on data-lines.
© Device that is electrically closest to processor has highest priority.
¢ Advantage: It requires fewer wires than the individual connections.

Arrangement of Priority Groups
Here, the devices are organized in groups & each group is connected at a different priority level.
¢ Within a group, devices are connected in a daisy chain. (Figure 4.8b).

EXCEPTIONS
¢ An interrupt is an event that causes
— execution of one program to be suspended &
— execution of another program to begin.
¢ Exception refers to any event that causes an interruption. For ex: I/O interrupts.

1. Recovery from Errors
¢ These are techniques to ensure that all hardware components are operating properly.
¢ For ex: Many computers include an ECC in memory which allows detection of errors in stored-
data. (ECC > Error Checking Code, ESR > Exception Service Routine).
e If an error occurs, control-hardware
— detects the errors &
— informs processor by raising an interrupt.
