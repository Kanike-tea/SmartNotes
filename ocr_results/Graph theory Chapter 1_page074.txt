1.7 Connected and Disconnected Graphs

Consider a graph G of order greater than or equal to two. Two vertices in G are said to be
connected if there is at least one path from one vertex to the other.*

We say that a graph G is a connected graph if every pair of distinct vertices in G are
connected. Otherwise, G is called a disconnected graph.

In other words, a graph G is said to be (i) connected if there is at least one path between

every two distinct vertices in G, and (ii) disconnected if G has at least one pair of distinct
vertices between which there is no path.

A digraph D is said to be connected or disconnected according as its underlying graph G is
connected or disconnected.

Intuitively, a graph G is connected if we can reach any vertex of G from any other vertex
of G by travelling along the edges, and disconnected otherwise.

For example, the graph shown in Figure 1.113(a) is connected whereas the graph shown in
Figure 1.113(b) is disconnected; because, for example, there is no path from vy to vg.

It is obvious that in a graph G all walks and, therefore, all trails, all circuits, all paths and
all cycles (when they exist) are connected subgraphs of G.

It is evident that every (nontrivial) graph G consists of one or more connected graphs. .Each
such connected graph is a subgraph of G and is called a component of G.

Obviously, a connected graph has only one component and a disconnected graph has two
Or more components, The number of components of a graph G is denoted by x(G).

“Recall that two vertices are said to be joined (with each other) if there is an edge joining them; that is if they
are adjacent vertices. Two vertices that are adjacent are connected. But, two vertices that are connected need not be
adjacent. For example, in Figure 1.104, the vertices A and R are connected but not adjacent. Thus, “joined vertices’
and “connected vertices” are not one and the same.
