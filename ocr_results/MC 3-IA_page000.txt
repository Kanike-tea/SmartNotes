1.1 ARM Processor Exceptions and Modes

Table | lists the ARM processor exceptions. Each exception causes the core to enter a specific
mode. In addition, any of the ARM processor modes can be entered manually by changing the

cpsr.

User and s;

em mode are the only two modes that are not entered by a corresponding exception,

in other words, to enter these modes you must modify the cpsr.
When an exception causes a mode change, the core automatically

© Saves the cpsr to the spsr of the exception mode
© Saves the pe to the Ir of the exception mode
© Sets the cpsr to the exception mode

¢ Sets pc to the address of the exception handler

Figure 1 shows a simplified view of exceptions and associated modes. Note that when an

exception occurs, the ARM processor always switches to ARM state.
