DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 3

In a tree data structure, the first node is called as Root Node. Every tree must have root node.
We can say that root node is the origin of tree data structure. In any tree, there must be only
one root node. We never have multiple root nodes in a tree. Ex: ‘A’ in the above tree

2. Edge

In a tree data structure, the connecting link between any two nodes is called as EDGE. In a tree
with 'N' number of nodes there will be a maximum of 'N-1' number of edges. Ex: Line between
two nodes.

In a tree data structure, the node which is predecessor of any node is called as PARENT NODE.
In simple words, the node which has branch from it to any other node is called as parent node.
Parent node can also be defined as "The node which has child / children".

Ex: A,B,C.E & G are parent nodes

In a tree data structure, the node which is descendant of any node is called as CHILD Node. In
simple words, the node which has a link from its parent node is called as child node. In a tree,
any parent node can have any number of child nodes. In a tree, all the nodes except root are
child nodes.Ex: B & C are children of A, G & H are children of C and K child of G

In a tree data structure, nodes which belong to same Parent are called as SIBLINGS. In simple
words, the nodes with same parent are called as Sibling nodes.Ex: B & C are siblings, D, E and
Fare siblings, G & H are siblings, I & J are siblings

6. Leaf

In a tree data structure, the node which does not have a child is called as LEAF Node. In simple
words, a leaf is a node with no child. In a tree data structure, the leaf nodes are also called as
External Nodes. External node is also a node with no child. In a tree, leaf node is also called as
'Terminal' node.Ex: D,I.J,F,K AND Hare leaf nodes

7. Internal Nodes

In a tree data structure, the node which has atleast one child is called as INTERNAL Node. In
simple words, an internal node is a node with atleast one child.

In a tree data structure, nodes other than leaf nodes are called as Internal Nodes. The root node
is also said to be Internal Node if the tree has more than one node. Internal nodes are also called
as 'Non-Terminal' nodes.

Ex: A,BCE&G
