organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows the nervous system to trigger a
specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a fascicle of the
muscle. Inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of
collagen and reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium surrounds the
extracellular matrix of the cells and plays a role in transferring force produced by the muscle
fibers to the tendons.

Inside the muscle fibers, there are tiny structures called myofibrils. Myofibrils are made
up of smaller units called sarcomeres, which are responsible for muscle contraction.

Sarcomeres contain thin (Actin) and thick filaments (Myosin) that work together to make
the muscle fibers contract. Each muscle fiber is surrounded by a protective layer called
endomysium. Multiple muscle fibers are grouped together into bundles called fascicles. Fascicles
are surrounded by another layer of connective tissue called perimysium.

All the fascicles together make up the entire muscle, which is surrounded by a layer
called epimysium. The muscle also has a special membrane called the sarcolemma, which
protects the muscle fiber. Inside the muscle fiber, there are small tunnels called T-tubules that
help transmit signals for muscle contraction. Muscles work through the coordination of motor
units, which consist of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it controls. This architecture allows
muscles to generate force, move our bodies, and perform various activities.

3.1.2 Mechanisms

The mechanism of how the muscular system can be used as a scaffold in regenerative
medicine involves the use of muscle cells and a scaffold to support the growth and regeneration
of new tissue.

The method of growing muscle tissue using hydrogel or artificial scaffold is explained
