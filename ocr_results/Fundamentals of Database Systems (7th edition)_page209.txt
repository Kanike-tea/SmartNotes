specifying retrieval queries, and Section 6.4 describes the SQL commands for
insertion, deletion, and update.

In Chapter 7, we will describe more complex SQL retrieval queries, as well as the
ALTER commands for changing the schema. We will also describe the CREATE
ASSERTION statement, which allows the specification of more general constraints
on the database, and the concept of triggers, which is presented in more detail in
Chapter 26. We discuss the SQL facility for defining views on the database in Chap-
ter 7. Views are also called virtual or derived tables because they present the user
with what appear to be tables; however, the information in those tables is derived
from previously defined tables.

Section 6.5 lists some SQL features that are presented in other chapters of the book;
these include object-oriented features in Chapter 12, XML in Chapter 13, transac-
tion control in Chapter 20, active databases (triggers) in Chapter 26, online analyti-
cal processing (OLAP) features in Chapter 29, and security/authorization in
Chapter 30. Section 6.6 summarizes the chapter. Chapters 10 and 11 discuss the
various database programming techniques for programming with SQL.

6.1 SQL Data Definition and Data Types

SQL uses the terms table, row, and column for the formal relational model terms
relation, tuple, and attribute, respectively. We will use the corresponding terms
interchangeably. The main SQL command for data definition is the CREATE state-
ment, which can be used to create schemas, tables (relations), types, and domains,
as well as other constructs such as views, assertions, and triggers. Before we describe
the relevant CREATE statements, we discuss schema and catalog concepts in Sec-
tion 6.1.1 to place our discussion in perspective. Section 6.1.2 describes how tables
are created, and Section 6.1.3 describes the most important data types available for
attribute specification. Because the SQL specification is very large, we give a descrip-
tion of the most important features. Further details can be found in the various SQL.
standards documents (see end-of-chapter bibliographic notes).

6.1.1 Schema and Catalog Concepts in SQL

Early versions of SQL did not include the concept of a relational database schema;
all tables (relations) were considered part of the same schema. The concept of an
SQL schema was incorporated starting with SQL2 in order to group together tables
and other constructs that belong to the same database application (in some systems,
a schema is called a database). An SQL schema is identified by a schema name and
includes an authorization identifier to indicate the user or account who owns the
schema, as well as descriptors for each element in the schema. Schema elements
include tables, types, constraints, views, domains, and other constructs (such as
authorization grants) that describe the schema. A schema is created via the CREATE
SCHEMA statement, which can include all the schema elements’ definitions. Alter-
natively, the schema can be assigned a name and authorization identifier, and the
