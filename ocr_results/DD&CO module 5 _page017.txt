Exponents Mantissas

Rg R
For example:
Segment 1: X=0.9504*108
Y=0.8200*10?
R 0.082
Segment 2:
Segment 3: $=0.9504+0.082=1.0324
Segment 4: 0.10324

= The exponent difference determines how many times the mantissaassociated
with the smaller exponent must be shifted to the right.
o Add or subtract the mantissas
o Normalize the result
= Whenan overflow occurs, the mantissa of the sum or difference isshifted right
and the exponent incremented by one.
= Ifan underflow occurs, the number of leading zeros in the mantissa determines
the number of left shifts in the mantissa and the numberthat must be subtracted
from the exponent.

4.4 Instruction Pipeline

Introduction:
Pipeline processing can occur not only in the data stream but in the instruction aswell.
Consider a computer with an instruction fetch unit (FIFO)and an instructionexecution
unit(PC) designed to provide a two-segment pipeline.
Computers with complex instructions require other phases in addition to abovephases to
process an instruction completely.
In the most general case, the computer needs to process each instruction with thefollowing
sequence of steps.

o Fetch the instruction from memory.
Decode the instruction.
Calculate the effective address.
Fetch the operands from memory.
Execute the instruction.

o Store the result in the proper place.
There are certain difficulties that will prevent the instruction pipeline from operatingat its
maximum rate.
