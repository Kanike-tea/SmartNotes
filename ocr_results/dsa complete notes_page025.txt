Data Structures and Applications/BCS304 Module-1

Storing Strings
Strings are stored in three types of structures
1. Fixed Length structure
2. Variable Length structure with fixed maximums
3. Linked structures

1. Fixed length Storage, record oriented: In this structure each line of text is viewed as a record
where all records have the same length or have the same number of characters

Example: Assuming our record has a maximum of 12 characters per record the strings are stored as
follows

0| 7 >DIA|TIA

1 | +S |T/R|U/C|T/U|R/E|S
2) + +»AIN{D

3 | +H AIPI[PILIL IIT |C{/A|TI|I JOIN
4| >>

5/ >

Advantages:
e Ease of accessing data from any given record
e Ease of updating data in any given record( provided the length of the new data does not exceed
the record length

Disadvantages
e Time is wasted reading an entire record if most of the storage consist of in essential blank
spaces

e Certain records may require more space or data than available
e When the correction consist of more or fewer characters than original text, updation requires
the entire record to be changed( the disadvantage can be resolved by using array of pointers)

2. Variable Length storage with fixed maximum: The storage of variable length strings in memory
cells wth fixed lengths can be done in two ways

e Use a marker such as ($) to mark the end of the string

e List the length of the string as an additional field in the pointer array

Example :

Pat abe)
UZ) 4p >
NO) A}4

3. Linked storage: Linked list is an ordered sequence of memory cells called nodes, where each node
stores two information the data and also stores the address of the next node in the list. Strings may be
stored in linked list as each node storing one character or a fixed number of characters and a link
containing the address of the node containing the next group of characters.
