As mentioned before, a null graph contains no edges. It therefore follows that in a nyj}
graph every vertex is an isolated vertex.

Regular graph

A graph in which all the vertices are of the same degree k is called a regular graph of
degree k, or a k-regular graph.

In particular, a 3-regular graph is called a cubic graph.

The graphs shown in Figures 1.35 and 1.36 are 2-regular and 4-regular graphs respectively.

“Tegular graph (cubic graph): This particular cubi¢
graph, which contains 10 vertices and 15 e

dges, is called the Petersen graph.
