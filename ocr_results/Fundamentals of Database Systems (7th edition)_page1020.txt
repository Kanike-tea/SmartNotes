Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models

= Image data includes data such as satellite images and aerial photographs,
which are typically created by cameras. Objects of interest, such as buildings
and roads, can be identified and overlaid on these images. Images can also
be attributes of map features. One can add images to other map features so
that clicking on the feature would display the image. Aerial and satellite
images are typical examples of raster data.

Models of spatial information are sometimes grouped into two broad categories:
field and object. A spatial application (such as remote sensing or highway traffic con-
trol) is modeled using either a field- or an object-based model, depending on the
requirements and the traditional choice of model for the application. Field models
are often used to model spatial data that is continuous in nature, such as terrain eleva-
tion, temperature data, and soil variation characteristics, whereas object models have
traditionally been used for applications such as transportation networks, land parcels,
buildings, and other objects that possess both spatial and non-spatial attributes.

26.3.3 Spatial Operators and Spatial Queries

Spatial operators are used to capture all the relevant geometric properties of objects
embedded in the physical space and the relations between them, as well as to per-
form spatial analysis. Operators are classified into three broad categories.

= Topological operators. Topological properties are invariant when topo-
logical transformations are applied. These properties do not change after
transformations like rotation, translation, or scaling. Topological operators
are hierarchically structured in several levels, where the base level offers
operators the ability to check for detailed topological relations between
regions with a broad boundary, and the higher levels offer more abstract
operators that allow users to query uncertain spatial data independent of
the underlying geometric data model. Examples include open (region),
close (region), and inside (point, loop).

= Projective operators. Projective operators, such as convex hull, are used to
express predicates about the concavity/convexity of objects as well as other
spatial relations (for example, being inside the concavity of a given object).

= Metric operators. Metric operators provide a more specific description of
the object’s geometry. They are used to measure some global properties of
single objects (such as the area, relative size of an object’s parts, compact-
ness, and symmetry), and to measure the relative position of different objects
in terms of distance and direction. Examples include length (arc) and dis-
tance (point, point).

Dynamic Spatial Operators. The operations performed by the operators men-
tioned above are static, in the sense that the operands are not affected by the appli-
cation of the operation. For example, calculating the length of the curve has no
effect on the curve itself. Dynamic operations alter the objects upon which the
operations act. The three fundamental dynamic operations are create, destroy, and
