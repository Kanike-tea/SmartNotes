Chapter 6 Basic SQL

and stored as a file by the DBMS. Base relations are distinguished from virtual
relations, created through the CREATE VIEW statement (see Chapter 7), which
may or may not correspond to an actual physical file. In SQL, the attributes in a
base table are considered to be ordered in the sequence in which they are speci-
fied in the CREATE TABLE statement. However, rows (tuples) are not considered
to be ordered within a table (relation).

It is important to note that in Figure 6.1, there are some foreign keys that may cause
errors because they are specified either via circular references or because they refer
to a table that has not yet been created. For example, the foreign key Super_ssn in
the EMPLOYEE table is a circular reference because it refers to the EMPLOYEE table
itself. The foreign key Dno in the EMPLOYEE table refers to the DEPARTMENT table,
which has not been created yet. To deal with this type of problem, these constraints
can be left out of the initial CREATE TABLE statement, and then added later using
the ALTER TABLE statement (see Chapter 7). We displayed all the foreign keys in
Figure 6.1 to show the complete COMPANY schema in one place.

6.1.3 Attribute Data Types and Domains in SOL

The basic data types available for attributes include numeric, character string, bit
string, Boolean, date, and time.

= Numeric data types include integer numbers of various sizes (INTEGER or
INT, and SMALLINT) and floating-point (real) numbers of various precision
(FLOAT or REAL, and DOUBLE PRECISION). Formatted numbers can be
declared by using DECIMAL(i, j)—or DEC(i, j) or NUMERIC(i, j) —where i, the
precision, is the total number of decimal digits and j, the scale, is the number
of digits after the decimal point. The default for scale is zero, and the default
for precision is implementation-defined.

= Character-string data types are either fixed length—CHAR(n) or
CHARACTER(n), where n is the number of characters—or varying length—
VARCHAR(n) or CHAR VARYING(1) or CHARACTER VARYING(1), where n is
the maximum number of characters. When specifying a literal string value,
it is placed between single quotation marks (apostrophes), and it is case sen-
sitive (a distinction is made between uppercase and lowercase). For fixed-
length strings, a shorter string is padded with blank characters to the right.
For example, if the value ‘Smith’ is for an attribute of type CHAR(10), it is
padded with five blank characters to become ‘Smith’ if needed. Padded
blanks are generally ignored when strings are compared. For comparison
purposes, strings are considered ordered in alphabetic (or lexicographic)
order; if a string str1 appears before another string str2 in alphabetic order,
then sfrl is considered to be less than str2.* There is also a concatenation
operator denoted by || (double vertical bar) that can concatenate two strings

SThis is not the case with SQL keywords, such as CREATE or CHAR. With keywords, SQL is case insen-
sitive, meaning that SQL treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent in keywords.

“For nonalphabetic characters, there is a defined order.
