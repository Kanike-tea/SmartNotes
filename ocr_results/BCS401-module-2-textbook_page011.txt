Decrease-and-Conquer

This very good performance in the best case of sorted arrays is not very useful by
itself, because we cannot expect such convenient inputs. However, almost-sorted
files do arise in a variety of applications, and insertion sort preserves its excellent
performance on such inputs.

A rigorous analysis of the algorithm’s average-case efficiency is based on
investigating the number of element pairs that are out of order (see Problem 11 in
this section’s exercises). It shows that on randomly ordered arrays, insertion sort
makes on average half as many comparisons as on decreasing arrays, ice.,

This twice-as-fast average-case performance coupled with an excellent efficiency
on almost-sorted arrays makes insertion sort stand out among its principal com-
petitors among elementary sorting algorithms, selection sort and bubble sort. In
addition, its extension named shellsort, after its inventor D. L. Shell [She59], gives
us an even better algorithm for sorting moderately large files (see Problem 12 in
this section’s exercises).
