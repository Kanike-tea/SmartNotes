Vertex degree and Handshaking property 37

, Draw a diagram of a graph where the degrees of the vertices are 1, 1, 1, 2,3, 4,5, 7.

. Draw a diagram for the four-dimensional hypercube Q,.

. Show that, in a simple graph having n vertices, the degree d of every vertex satisfies the inequality

O<d<n-l.

. Consider a graph having n vertices and m edges. If p number of vertices are of degree k and the

remaining vertices are of degree k + 1, prove that p=(k+1)n—2m.

. For a graph G = (V, E), what is the largest possible value of |V| if |E| = 35 and deg v > 3 for all

vev?

. How many vertices will the following graphs have, if they contain

(i) 16 edges and all vertices of degree 4?
(ii) 21 edges, 3 vertices of degree 4, and other vertices of degree 3?

(iii) 12 edges, 6 vertices of degree 3, and other vertices of degree less than 3.

Find the fewest vertices needed to construct a complete graph with at least 1000 edges.

Show that there is no simple graph with four vertices such that three vertices have degree 3 and
one vertex has degree 1.

Prove that there is no simple graph with seven vertices, one of which has degree 2, two have
degree 3, three have degree 4 and the remaining vertex has degree 5.

Let G be a graph with exactly n — 1 edges. Prove that G has either a pendant vertex or an isolated

vertex.

Prove that every cubic graph has an even number of vertices.

Prove that there is no simple graph for which the degree sequence is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,7.
Show that the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph of order 2n is n?.

Let G be a graph with n vertices and m edges and let k be the smallest positive integer such that
k > 2m/n. Prove that G has a vertex of degree at least k.

Show that in any set of at least two persons, there are always two persons with exactly the same
number of friends in the set.

Prove that it is impossible to have a set of nine people at a party such that each one knows exactly
five of the others in the party.

Prove that there can be a gathering of five persons in which there are no three persons who all
know each other and no three persons none of whom knows either of the other two.
