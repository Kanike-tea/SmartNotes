3. PERFORMANCE

e The performance of a Computer System is based on hardware design of the processor and
the instruction set of the processors.

¢ To obtain high performance of computer system it is necessary to reduce the execution
time of the processor.

« Execution time: It is defined as total time required executing one complete program.

e The processing time of a program includes time taken to readyinputs, display outputs,
system services, execution time etc.

e The performance of the processor is inversely proportional to execution time of the
processor.

More performance = Less Execution time.

Less Performance = More Execution time.

as shown in the fig

The processor needs more time to read the data and instructions from main memory
because main memory is away from the processor as shown in the figure. Hence it slowdown the
performance of the system.

The processor needs less time to read the data and instructions from Cache Memory
because it is part of the processor. Hence it improves the performance of the system.
