migrated to become an attribute of one of the participating entity types?

. When we think of relationships as attributes, what are the value sets of these

attributes? What class of data models is based on this concept?

What is meant by a recursive relationship type? Give some examples of
recursive relationship types.

When is the concept of a weak entity used in data modeling? Define the
terms owner entity type, weak entity type, identifying relationship type, and
