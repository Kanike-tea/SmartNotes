THREADED BINARY TREE

The limitations of binary tree are:
e In binary tree, there are n+1 null links out of 2n total links.

e Traversing a tree with binary tree is time consuming.
These limitations can be overcome by threaded binary tree.

In the linked representation of any binary tree, there are more null links than actual pointers.
These null links are replaced by the pointers, called threads, which points to other nodes in the
tree.

To construct the threads use the following rules:
1. Assume that ptr represents a node. If ptr—leftChild is null, then replace the null link
with a pointer to the inorder predecessor of ptr.
2. If ptr —rightChild is null, replace the null link with a pointer to the inorder successor of

ptr.

Ex: Consider the binary tree as shown in below figure:

Figure A: Binary Tree

There should be no loose threads in threaded binary tree. But in Figure B two threads have
been left dangling: one in the left child of H, the other in the right child of G.

Figure B: Threaded tree corresponding to Figure A

In above figure the new threads are drawn in broken lines. This tree has 9 node and 10 0-links
which has been replaced by threads.
