LAB PROGRAM 05 (a)

5 a) Write a Python program to Demonstrate how to Draw a Histogram Plot using

Matplotlib.

Aim: Demonstration of how to draw a scatter plot using Matplotlib.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

The below program demonstrates how to draw a scatter plot using Matplotlib. Make sure you
have Matplotlib installed before running this code. You can install it using pip if you haven't

already:
pip install matplotlib

This Python program uses the Matplotlib library to generate and display a histogram plot. Here's

a step-by-step explanation of the program:

1. Import necessary libraries: The program imports the Matplotlib library for creating plots
and the NumPy library for generating random data.

2. Generate random data for the histogram: The code uses NumPy's randn function to
generate 1000 random data points sampled from a standard normal distribution (mean=0,
standard deviation=1).

3. Create a histogram plot: The hist function from Matplotlib is used to create a histogram
plot. The parameters include:

e data: The input data for which the histogram is computed.
e bins: The number of bins in the histogram.

e edgecolor: The color of the edges of the bins.

e alpha: The transparency of the bars.

4. Add labels and a title: The xlabel, ylabel, and title functions are used to add labels to the
x-axis and y-axis, as well as a title to the plot.

5. Show the plot: Finally, the show function is called to display the histogram plot. This
function is necessary when running the script in a non-interactive environment (e.g., a
script or a non-interactive Python environment like a Jupyter notebook). In an interactive
environment, like a Jupyter notebook, the plot would be displayed automatically without

the need for plt.show().
