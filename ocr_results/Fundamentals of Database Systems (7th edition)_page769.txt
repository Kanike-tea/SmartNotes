was devoted to a discussion of how typical queries in data warehouses are opti-
mized. We gave an example of cost-based query transformation in data ware-
house queries on the so-called star schema. In Section 19.9 we presented a detailed
overview of the Oracle query optimizer, which uses a number of additional tech-
niques, details of which were beyond our scope. Finally, in Section 19.10 we men-
tioned the technique of semantic query optimization, which uses the semantics or
integrity constraints to simplify the query or completely avoid accessing the data
or the actual execution of the query.

Review Questions
19.1. What is a query execution plan?

19.2. What is meant by the term heuristic optimization? Discuss the main heuris-
tics that are applied during query optimization.

19.3. How does a query tree represent a relational algebra expression? What is
meant by an execution of a query tree? Discuss the rules for transformation
of query trees, and identify when each rule should be applied during optimi-
zation.

19.4. How many different join orders are there for a query that joins 10 relations?
How many left-deep trees are possible?

19.5. What is meant by cost-based query optimization?

19.6. What is the optimization approach based on dynamic programming? How
is it used during query optimization?

19.7. What are the problems associated with keeping views materialized?
19.8. What is the difference between pipelining and materialization?

19.9. Discuss the cost components for a cost function that is used to estimate
query execution cost. Which cost components are used most often as the
basis for cost functions?

19.10. Discuss the different types of parameters that are used in cost functions.
Where is this information kept?

19.11. What are semi-join and anti-join? What are the join selectivity and join car-
dinality parameters associated with them? Provide appropriate formulas.

19.12. List the cost functions for the SELECT and JOIN methods discussed in
Sections19.4 and 19.5.

19.13. Whatare the special features of query optimization in Oracle that we did not
discuss in the chapter?

19.14. What is meant by semantic query optimization? How does it differ from
other query optimization techniques?
