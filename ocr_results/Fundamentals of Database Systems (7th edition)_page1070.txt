Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

Hyphens and punctuation marks may be handled in different ways. Either the
entire phrase with the hyphens/punctuation marks may be used, or they may be
eliminated. In some systems, the character representing the hyphen/punctuation
mark may be removed, or may be replaced with a space. Different information
retrieval systems follow different rules of processing. Handling hyphens automati-
cally can be complex: it can either be done as a classification problem, or more com-
monly by some heuristic rules. For example, the StandardTokenizer in Lucene™*
treats the hyphen as a delimeter to break words—with the exception that if there is
a number in the token, the words are not split (for example, words like AK-47,
phone numbers, etc.). Many domain-specific terms like product catalogs, different
versions of a product, and so on have hyphens in them. When search engines crawl
the Web for indexing, it becomes difficult to automatically treat hyphens correctly;
therefore, simpler strategies are devised to process hyphens.

Most information retrieval systems perform case-insensitive search, converting
all the letters of the text to uppercase or lowercase. It is also worth noting that
many of these text preprocessing steps are language specific, such as involving
accents and diacritics and the idiosyncrasies that are associated with a particular
language.

27.4.5 Information Extraction

Information extraction (IE) is a generic term used for extracting structured con-
tent from text. Text analytic tasks such as identifying noun phrases, facts, events,
people, places, and relationships are examples of IE tasks. These tasks are also
called named entity recognition tasks and use rule-based approaches with either a
thesaurus, regular expressions and grammars, or probabilistic approaches. For IR
and search applications, IE technologies are mostly used to identify named entities
that involve text analysis, matching, and categorization for improving the rele-
vance of search systems. Language technologies using part-of-speech tagging are
applied to semantically annotate the documents with extracted features to aid
search relevance.

27.5 Inverted Indexing

The simplest way to search for occurrences of query terms in text collections can be
performed by sequentially scanning the text. This kind of online searching is only
appropriate when text collections are small. Most information retrieval systems
process the text collections to create indexes and operate upon the inverted index
data structure (refer to the indexing task in Figure 27.1). An inverted index struc-
ture comprises vocabulary and document information. Vocabulary is a set of dis-
tinct query terms in the document set. Each term in a vocabulary set has an
associated collection of information about the documents that contain the term,
such as document id, occurrence count, and offsets within the document where the
