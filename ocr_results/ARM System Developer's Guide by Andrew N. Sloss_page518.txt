L2 page table entries.

A small PTE holds the base address of a 4 KB block of physical memory. The entry
also includes four sets of permission bit fields and the cache and write buffer attributes
for the page. Each set of permission bit fields represents one-fourth of the page in virtual
memory. These entries may be thought of as 1 KB subpages providing finer control of access
permission within the 4 KB page.

A tiny PTE provides the base address of a 1 KB block of physical memory. The entry
also includes a single access permission bit field and the cache and write buffer attributes
for the page. The tiny page has not been incorporated in the ARMVv6 architecture. If you are
planning to create a system that is easily portable to future architectures, we recommend
avoiding the use of tiny 1 KB pages in your system.

A fault PTE generates a memory page access fault. The fault condition results in either
a prefetch or data abort, depending on the type of memory access.

14.4.4 SELECTING A PAGE SIZE FOR YOUR EMBEDDED SYSTEM

Here are some tips and suggestions for setting the page size in your system:

= The smaller the page size, the more page frames there will be in a given block of physical
memory.
