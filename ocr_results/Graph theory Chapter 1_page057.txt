LetG bea simple graph of order n. If the size of G is 56 and the size of G Is OU
what is n?

> Recall that G = K,-G. Therefore,
size of G = (size of K,) ~ (size of G)

Since size of K, (that is : the number of edges in K,,) is 5n(n~ 1), this yields

80 = dnin-1)~56, or, n~1) = 1604112 =272 = 17x16.

Thus, n = 17. (Thatis, G is of order 17).
