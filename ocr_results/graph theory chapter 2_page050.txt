2.6. Map Colouring 151

In Example 7 of Section 2.5 we have proved that every connected simple planar graph is
6-colourable.

The following theorem, known as the Five colour Theorem, is an improvement of the above
stated result.

Five Colour Theorem: The vertices of every connected simple planar graph can be properly
coloured with five colours.

(i Proof: Let be the number of vertices in a connected, simple planar graph. If n < 5, then the
\ theorem is trivially true. Assume that the theorem is true for all graphs with n < k. Consider a
graph G with k +1 vertices. Then, by virtue of Euler’s theorem, G contains a vertex v of degree
\ at most 5*. If we consider the graph H = G — v, obtained by deleting v from G, then H has k
| vertices. Therefore, by the assumption made, H is 5-colourable.
| Since the degree of v is at most 5, v has at most 5 neighbours in G. Suppose v has 4 or
\tess number of neighbours. Then the neighbours can be coloured with at most four different
colours and v can be coloured with the fifth colour, all drawn from the colours used in H. Thus,
a proper colouring of G can be done by using the five colours with which H can be coloured.
Thus, G is 5-colourable.
Next, suppose that v has 5 neighbours, say vj, v2, v3, v4, vs. Let us arrange them around
v in anti-clockwise order as in Figure 2.62. If the vertices vj, v2, v3,...,V5 are all mutually
adjacent, then they constitute Ks which is non-planar. This is not possible, because, being a
planar graph, G cannot contain a non-planar graph as a subgraph. Therefore, at least two of v1,

¥2,...,¥5, Say vy and v3, are non-adjacent. ae UA

Now, construct a graph G’ by merging the edges v3v and vy). The graph G’ will have
kt lio. k —1 vertices (with v3vv, as the merged vertex). This graph is, therefore, 5-
