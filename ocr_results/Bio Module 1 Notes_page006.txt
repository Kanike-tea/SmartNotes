be used to grow a specific type of tissue or organ. This can be helpful in kidney and liver
transplants. The doctors have already used the stem cells from beneath the epidermis to develop

skin tissue that can repair severe burns or other injuries by tissue grafting.

2. Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease: A team of researchers have developed blood vessels in
mice using human stem cells. Within two weeks of implantation, the blood vessels forme their

network and were as efficient as the natural vessels.

3. Treatment of Brain Diseases: Stem cells can also treat diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and
Alzheimer’s. These can help to replenish the damaged brain cells. Researchers have tried to
differentiate embryonic stem cells into these types of cells and make it possible to treat

diseases.

4. Blood Disease Treatment: The adult hematopoietic stem cells are used to treat cancers, sickle
cell anaemia, and other immunodeficiency diseases. These stem cells can be used to produce

red blood cells and white blood cells in the body.

Sources of Stem Cells

Stem Cells originate from different parts of the body. Adult stem cells can be found in specific
tissues in the human body. Matured cells are specialized to conduct various functions. Generally,

these cells can develop the kind of cells found in tissues where they reside.

Embryonic Stem Cells are derived from 5-day-old blastocysts that develop into embryos and are
pluripotent in nature. These cells can develop any type of cell and tissue in the body. These cells
have the potential to regenerate all the cells and tissues that have been lost because of any kind of

injury or disease.

Biomolecules

Biomolecules are the most essential organic molecules, which are involved in the maintenance and
metabolic processes of living organisms. These non-living molecules are the actual foot-soldiers of

the battle of sustenance of life.

They range from small molecules such as primary and secondary metabolites and hormones to large

macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids etc.
