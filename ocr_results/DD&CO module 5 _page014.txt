«The five registers are loaded with new data every clock pulse. The effect of eachclock is shown
in Table 9-1.

General considerations

«Any operation that can be decomposed into a sequence of sub operations of aboutthe same
complexity can be implemented by a pipeline processor.

«The general structure of a four-segment pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 9-3.

«© We define a task as the total operation performed going through all the segments inthe pipeline.

e The behavior of a pipeline can be illustrated with a space-time diagram.

o It shows the segment utilization as a function of time.
