5. Neo4j and Cypher

Neo4j is the most mature and popular graph database. It uses a native graph storage engine
and supports ACID-compliant transactions.

Its query language, Cypher, allows expressive graph querying with a clear and human-
readable syntax.

Example Cypher query:

cypher

CopyEdit

MATCH (a:Person)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(b:Person)
WHERE a.name = ‘Alice’

RETURN b.name;

This retrieves the names of Alice’s friends. Neo4j supports indexing, full-text search, and
complex graph algorithms like shortest path, community detection, and centrality.
