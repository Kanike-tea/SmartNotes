Another important matrix used in the representation and study of digraphs is
the adjacency matrix defined as follows : Let G be a digraph with n vertices,

containing no parallel edges. Then the adjacency matrix X = [xj] of the digraph
Gis ann by n (0, 1)-matrix whose element

if there is an edge directed from ith vertex to jth vertex,
otherwise.

A digraph and its adjacency matrix are shown in Fig. 9-19.

The adjacency matrix occurs in many different disciplines, and therefore has
different names. In the theory of sequential machines it is called the transition
matrix. In the calculus of relations it is called the relation matrix. (Observe that
the relation matrix defined in Section 9-3 is the same as the adjacency matrix of
the corresponding digraph.) In network flows it is called the connection matrix.
It is also known as the precedence matrix or preference matrix in some
sociological applications. In scheduling and critical-path analysis the adjacency
matrix is known as the predecessor matrix.

Let us make the following observations on the properties of the adjacency
matrix X of a digraph G.
