Nota WBLT Itis a WBLT

Here we consider number of nodes in the subtree rather than the length of a shortest
root to external node path
w(x) be the weight of a node x
if x is an external node
w(x) =
1+ sum of the weights of the children otherwise

Definition : A binary tree is a Weight Biased Leftist Tree (WBLT) iff at every internal node
the w value of the left child is greater than or equal to the w value of the right child.

A max(min) WBLT is a max(min) tree that is also a WBLT
Insert and delete operations are analogous to HBLT operations

The meld operation can be done in a single top-to-bottom pass. On the way down, we
can update w-values and swap subtrees as necessary.

5.0.8 Optimal Binary Search Tree:

In computer science, an optimal binary search tree (Optimal BST), sometimes called a weight-balanced
binary tree, is a binary search tree which provides the smallest possible search time (or expected search
time) for a given sequence of accesses (or access probabilities).
