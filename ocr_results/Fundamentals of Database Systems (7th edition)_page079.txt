2.5 Centralized and Client/Server Architectures for DBMSs

machines. Two main types of basic DBMS architectures were created on this under-
lying client/server framework: two-tier and three-tier.'* We discuss them next.

2.5.3 Two-Tier Client/Server Architectures for DBMSs

In relational database management systems (RDBMSs), many of which started
as centralized systems, the system components that were first moved to the
client side were the user interface and application programs. Because SQL (see
Chapters 6 and 7) provided a standard language for RDBMSs, this created a
logical dividing point between client and server. Hence, the query and transac-
tion functionality related to SQL processing remained on the server side. In
such an architecture, the server is often called a query server or transaction
server because it provides these two functionalities. In an RDBMS, the server is
also often called an SQL server.

The user interface programs and application programs can run on the client side.
When DBMS access is required, the program establishes a connection to the
DBMS (which is on the server side); once the connection is created, the client
program can communicate with the DBMS. A standard called Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) provides an application programming interface (API),
which allows client-side programs to call the DBMS, as long as both client and
server machines have the necessary software installed. Most DBMS vendors pro-
vide ODBC drivers for their systems. A client program can actually connect to
several RDBMSs and send query and transaction requests using the ODBC API,
which are then processed at the server sites. Any query results are sent back to the
client program, which can process and display the results as needed. A related
standard for the Java programming language, called JDBC, has also been defined.
This allows Java client programs to access one or more DBMSs through a stan-
dard interface.

The architectures described here are called two-tier architectures because the soft-
ware components are distributed over two systems: client and server. The advan-
tages of this architecture are its simplicity and seamless compatibility with existing
systems. The emergence of the Web changed the roles of clients and servers, leading
to the three-tier architecture.

2.5.4 Three-Tier and n-Tier Architectures
for Web Applications
Many Web applications use an architecture called the three-tier architecture,

which adds an intermediate layer between the client and the database server, as
illustrated in Figure 2.7(a).

'3There are many other variations of client/server architectures. We discuss the two most basic ones
here.
