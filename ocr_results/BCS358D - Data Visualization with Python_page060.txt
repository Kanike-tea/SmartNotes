LAB PROGRAM 06 (a)
6a) Write a Python program to illustrate Linear Plotting using Matplotlib.
Aim: Demonstration of how to draw a liner plotting using Matplotlib.
PROGRAM EXPLANATION

The below program demonstrates how to draw a linear plotting using Matplotlib. Make sure you
have Matplotlib installed before running this code. You can install it using pip if you haven't
already:
pip install matplotlib
1. ‘import matplotlib.pyplot as plt’: This line imports the ‘matplotlib.pyplot’ module and
assigns it the alias ‘plt’. This module provides a collection of functions for creating
various types of plots and charts.
2. Sample data for the linear plot:

e ‘x’: A list of x-axis data points representing the independent variable.

e ‘y’: A list of y-axis data points representing the dependent variable. Each y-value
corresponds to an x-value.

3. Creating the linear plot:

e ‘plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', linestyle='-')’: This line creates a line plot using the plot
function. It takes x and y as arguments to specify the data to be plotted. The
marker='o' argument adds circular markers at each data point, and the linestyle='-'
argument specifies that the line connecting the data points should be a solid line.
This will result in a line chart that connects the data points with a solid line and
places circular markers at each data point.

4. Adding labels and a title:

e  ‘plt.xlabel('X-Axis')’ and ‘plt.ylabel("Y-Axis')’: These two lines add labels to the
x-axis and y-axis, respectively. In this code, 'X-Axis' is used as the x-axis label,
and 'Y-Axis' is used as the y-axis label.

e  ‘pit.title(‘Linear Plot Example')’: This line adds a title to the plot. In this code, the
title is set to 'Linear Plot Example’.
5. Displaying the plot:

. t.grid()’: This line adds a grid to the plot for better readability. The grid lines

help in visually estimating values more accurately.
