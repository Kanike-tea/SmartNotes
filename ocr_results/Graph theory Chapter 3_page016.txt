2,1 Preorder and Postorder Traversals.
Below we illustrate two methods of listing the vertices of a rooted tree, known as Preorder

Traversal and Postorder Traversal. The general discussion is omitted.
Consider the rooted tree shown in Figure 3.16.

| Since 2 ig hot a root of a subtree of 7, we go to the subtree of T that lies to the right. Here, we
he *lect the vertices 6 and 3, We pass on to.the next subfree (to the right) and select 7, 11, 12, 13,

Oe Finally, we select the root of the tree, namely 1, In this way, we obtain the following list
of Vettices Of the tree T.

This list is called the Postorder traversal of T.:
