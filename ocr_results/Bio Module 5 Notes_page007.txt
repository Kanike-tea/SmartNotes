e Prosthetics: Artificial muscles can be used to create more advanced prosthetic limbs that are
more responsive and capable of performing a wider range of movements.

e Biomedical devices: Artificial muscles can be used in various biomedical devices, such as
heart assist pumps and artificial hearts, to improve their performance and reliability.

e Textile and clothing applications: Artificial muscles can be integrated into textiles and
clothing to create smart garments that can change shape and adjust to the wearer's
movements.

Artificial muscles have several advantages over traditional motors, including higher
power-to-weight ratios, faster response times, and greater flexibility. However, the technology is
still in the early stages of development and further research is needed to fully realize its potential
and overcome its limitations.

3.2 Skeletal Systems as Scaffolds:

3.2.1 Skeletal System

The skeletal system of human beings refers to the framework of bones, joints, and
connective tissues that provide structure, support, and protection to the body.

The key components and functions of the skeletal system are:

Bones: The human body consists of 206 bones that vary in size and shape. Bones are
composed of hard and dense connective tissue that provides strength and support. They serve as
the anchor points for muscles, protect internal organs, and store minerals like calcium and
phosphorus.

Cartilage: Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue found in certain joints and structures
such as the ears and nose. It acts as a cushion between bones, reducing friction and absorbing
shock.

Ligaments: Ligaments are tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to other bones
in joints, providing stability and preventing excessive movement.

Tendons: Tendons are strong fibrous tissues that connect muscles to bones, enabling
movement by transmitting the force generated by muscles.
