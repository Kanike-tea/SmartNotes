1.2.1. Vertex degree and Handshaking property 27

The graph shoes in Figure 1.38 is a cubic graph with 8 = 2? vertices. This particular graph
is called the three-dimensional hypercube and is denoted by Q3.

Figure 1.38

In general, for any positive integer k, a loop-free k-regular graph with 2" vertices is called
the k-dimensional hypercube (or k-cube) and is denoted by Qx.* (Note that the graph shown in
Figure 1.35 is Q2).

Handshaking Property

Let us refer back to the graph shown in Figure 1.33. As noted earlier, we have, in this
graph,

deg(v;)=3, deg(v2)=4, deg(v3)=4, deg(v4) = 3.

Also, the graph has 7 edges. We observe that
deg(v;) + deg(v2) + deg(v3) + deg(v4) = 14 =2 7.

This observation illustrates the following important property common to all (finite) graphs.

perty : The sum of the degrees of all the vertices in a graph is an even number; and this
umber is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph.
In an alternative form, this property reads as follows:
For a graph G = (V,E).
>) dee) = 2121.
veV :
This property is obvious from the fact that while counting the degrees of vertices, each
ge is counted twice (once at each end).
The aforesaid property is popularly called the handshaking property.' Because, it essen-
ially states that if several people shake hands, then the total number of hands shaken must be
‘ven, because just two hands are involved in each handshake.

ihe graph Q, arises in the study of Computer Architecture.
Handshaking property was the first result noted in Graph Theory. This property is also known as the First
‘orem of Graph Theory.
