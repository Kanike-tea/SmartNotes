100 Chapter 4 Introduction to the Thumb Instruction Set

4.9 SUMMARY

In this chapter we covered the Thumb instruction set. All Thumb instructions are 16 bits
in length. Thumb provides approximately 30% better code density over ARM code. Most
code written for Thumb is in a high-level language such as C and C++.

ATPCS defines how ARM and Thumb code call each other, called ARM-Thumb
interworking. Interworking uses the branch exchange (BX) instruction and branch exchange
with link (BLX) instruction to change state and jump to a specific routine.

In Thumb, only the branch instructions are conditionally executed. The barrel shift
operations (ASR, LSL, LSR, and ROR) are separate instructions.

The multiple-register load-store instructions only support the increment after (IA)
addressing mode. The Thumb instruction set includes POP and PUSH instructions as stack
operations. These instructions only support a full descending stack.

There are no Thumb instructions to access the coprocessors, cpsr, and spsr.
