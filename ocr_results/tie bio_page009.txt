Module #2&3

1. Discuss the architecture of the human brain.

Answer:

Brain Architecture — The Cortex

Both halves of the brain have 4 ‘lobes’. There is an additional
structure at the back of the brain called the ‘Cerebellum’.

The brain is the most important organ which is divided into three parts:

1. The Forebrain
2. The Midbrain
3. The Hindbrain

The brain has approximately 30 per cent of oxygen. It interprets information from the five
senses in a body along with the internal organ stomach. The Central Nervous System
sometimes also includes the retina, optic nerves, olfactory epithelium and olfactory nerves as
they connect directly with the tissues of the brain without any connecting nerve fibres. On the
other hand, the spinal cord acts as a bridge between the brain and the body. Thus, if the spinal
cord is injured or affected, the flow of information will be interrupted.

The brain is made up of different parts. These include the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the
thalamus, the hypothalamus and the brainstem.

The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It controls intelligence, memory, personality,
emotion, speech, and ability to feel and move. It is divided into left and right hemispheres,
linked by a band of nerve fibres in the centre of the brain called the corpus callosum.

Each hemisphere is divided into 4 lobes, or sections, which are all connected.

e The frontal lobes control movement, speech and some of the functions of the mind
like behaviour, mood, memory and organisation.

« The temporal lobes play an important part in memory, hearing, speech and language.

e The parietal lobes play an important part in taste, touch, temperature and pain, and
also in the understanding of numbers, awareness of the body and feeling of space.
