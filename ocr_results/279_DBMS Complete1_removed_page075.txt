Integrity Constraints

Integrity Constraints guard against accidental damage to the database.
Integrity constraints are predicates pertaining to the database.
Domain Constraints:
Predicates defined on the domains are Domain constraints.
Simplest Domain constraints are defined by defining standard data types of the attributes
like Integer, Double, Float, etc.
We can define domains by create domain clause also we can define the constraints on such
domains as follows:
create domain hourly-wage numeric(5,2)
constraint wage-value-test check(value >= 4.00)
So we can use hourly-wage as data type for any attribute where DBMS will automatically
allow only values greater than or equal to 4.00.
Other examples for defining Domain constraints are as follows:
create domain account-number char(10)
constraint account-number-null-test check(value not null)
create domain account-type char(10)
constraint account-type-test

check (value in ( “Checking”, “Saving”))

By using the later domain of two above the DBMS will allow only values for any attribute having
type as account-type i.e. Checking and Saving.

Referential Integrity:

Foreign Key: If two table R and S are related to each other, K1 and K2 are primary keys of
the two relations also K1 is one of the attribute in S. Suppose we want that every row in S
must have a corresponding row in R, then we define the K1 in S as foreign key. Example in
our original database of library we had a table for relation BORROWEDBY, containing two
fields Card No. and Acc. No. . Every row of BORROWEDBY relation must have
corresponding row in USER Table having same Card No. and a row in BOOK table having
same Acc. No.. Then we will define the Card No. and Acc. No. in BORROWEDBY relation
as foreign keys.

In other way we can say that every row of BORROWEDBY relation must refer to some row
in BOOK and also in USER tables.

Such referential requirement in one table to another table is called Referential Integrity.
