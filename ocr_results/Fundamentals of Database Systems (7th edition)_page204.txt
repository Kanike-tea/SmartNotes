Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

Name

numbers in a Social Security number—XXX-XX-XXXX). However, Social
Security numbers are usually represented as just one attribute. The decision
is based on how the database will be used. This exercise asks you to think
about specific situations where dividing the SSN is useful.

Consider a STUDENT relation in a UNIVERSITY database with the following
attributes (Name, Ssn, Local_phone, Address, Cell_phone, Age, Gpa). Note that
the cell phone may be from a different city and state (or province) from the
local phone. A possible tuple of the relation is shown below:

Ssn Local_phone Address Cellphone Age Gpa

a. Identify the critical missing information from the Local_phone and
Cell_phone attributes. (Hint: How do you call someone who lives in a dif-
ferent state or province?)

b. Would you store this additional information in the Local_phone and
Cell_phone attributes or add new attributes to the schema for STUDENT?

c. Consider the Name attribute. What are the advantages and disadvantages
of splitting this field from one attribute into three attributes (first name,
middle name, and last name)?

d. What general guideline would you recommend for deciding when to
store information in a single attribute and when to split the information?

e. Suppose the student can have between 0 and 5 phones. Suggest two dif-
ferent designs that allow this type of information.

Recent changes in privacy laws have disallowed organizations from using
Social Security numbers to identify individuals unless certain restrictions
are satisfied. As a result, most U.S. universities cannot use SSNs as primary
keys (except for financial data). In practice, Student_id, a unique identifier
assigned to every student, is likely to be used as the primary key rather than
SSN since Student_id can be used throughout the system.

a. Some database designers are reluctant to use generated keys (also known
as surrogate keys) for primary keys (such as Student_id) because they are
artificial. Can you propose any natural choices of keys that can be used to
identify the student record in a UNIVERSITY database?

b. Suppose that you are able to guarantee uniqueness of a natural key that
includes last name. Are you guaranteed that the last name will not change
during the lifetime of the database? If last name can change, what solu-
tions can you propose for creating a primary key that still includes last
name but remains unique?

c. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using generated (surro-
gate) keys?
