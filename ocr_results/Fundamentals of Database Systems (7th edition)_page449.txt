12.7 Summary

Then, in Section 12.2, we showed how many of these concepts were incorporated
into the relational model and the SQL standard; we showed that this incorporation
leads to expanded relational database functionality. These systems have been called
object-relational databases.

We then discussed the ODMG 3.0 standard for object databases. We started by
describing the various constructs of the object model in Sction 12.3. The various
built-in types, such as Object, Collection, Iterator, set, list, and so on, were described by
their interfaces, which specify the built-in operations of each type. These built-in
types are the foundation upon which the object definition language (ODL) and
object query language (OQL) are based. We also described the difference between
objects, which have an Objectld, and literals, which are values with no OID. Users
can declare classes for their application that inherit operations from the appropriate
built-in interfaces. Two types of properties can be specified in a user-defined class—
attributes and relationships—in addition to the operations that can be applied to
objects of the class. The ODL allows users to specify both interfaces and classes, and
permits two different types of inheritance—interface inheritance via “:” and class
inheritance via extends. A class can have an extent and keys. A description of ODL
followed, and an example database schema for the UNIVERSITY database was used to
illustrate the ODL constructs.

Following the description of the ODMG object model, we described a general tech-
nique for designing object database schemas in Section 12.4. We discussed how
object databases differ from relational databases in three main areas: references to
represent relationships, inclusion of operations, and inheritance. Finally, we
showed how to map a conceptual database design in the EER model to the con-
structs of object databases.

In Section 12.5, we presented an overview of the object query language (OQL). The
OQL follows the concept of orthogonality in constructing queries, meaning that an
operation can be applied to the result of another operation as long as the type of the
result is of the correct input type for the operation. The OQL syntax follows many
of the constructs of SQL but includes additional concepts such as path expressions,
inheritance, methods, relationships, and collections. Examples of how to use OQL
over the UNIVERSITY database were given.

Next we gave an overview of the C++ language binding in Section 12.6, which
extends C++ class declarations with the ODL type constructors but permits seam-
less integration of C++ with the ODBMS.

In 1997 Sun endorsed the ODMG API (Application Program Interface). O2 tech-
nologies was the first corporation to deliver an ODMG-compliant DBMS. Many
ODBMS vendors, including Object Design (now eXcelon), Gemstone Systems, POET
Software, and Versant Corporation*’, have endorsed the ODMG standard.
