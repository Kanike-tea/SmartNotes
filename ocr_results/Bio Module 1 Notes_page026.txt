Disorders Related to Hormones

1. Diabetes Mellitus — Insulin deficiency or resistance leads to high blood sugar.

2. Hypothyroidism — Low thyroid hormone levels cause slow metabolism, weight gain,

and fatigue.

3. Hyperthyroidism — Excess thyroid hormones cause rapid metabolism, weight loss, and

anxiety.

4. Cushing’s Syndrome — Excess cortisol leads to weight gain, high blood pressure, and

muscle weakness.

5. Addison’s Disease — Low cortisol causes fatigue, weight loss, and low blood pressure.

Hence, hormones play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating metabolism,

growth, reproduction, and stress response. Their proper functioning is essential for overall

health, and imbalances can lead to various disorders.
