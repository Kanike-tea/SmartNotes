Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

We presented a list of capabilities that should be provided by the DBMS software to
the DBA, database designers, and end users to help them design, administer, and
use a database. Then we gave a brief historical perspective on the evolution of data-
base applications. We pointed out the recent rapid growth of the amounts and types
of data that must be stored in databases, and we discussed the emergence of new
systems for handling “big data” applications. Finally, we discussed the overhead
costs of using a DBMS and discussed some situations in which it may not be advan-
tageous to use one.
