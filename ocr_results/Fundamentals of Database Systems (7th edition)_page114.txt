Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

once an attribute is replaced by a relationship, the attribute itself should be
removed from the entity type to avoid duplication and redundancy.

= Similarly, an attribute that exists in several entity types may be elevated or
promoted to an independent entity type. For example, suppose that each
of several entity types in a UNIVERSITY database, such as STUDENT,
INSTRUCTOR, and COURSE, has an attribute Department in the
initial design; the designer may then choose to create an entity type
DEPARTMENT with a single attribute Dept_name and relate it to the three
entity types (STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, and COURSE) via appropriate rela-
tionships. Other attributes/relationships of DEPARTMENT may be discov-
ered later.

= An inverse refinement to the previous case may be applied—for example, if
an entity type DEPARTMENT exists in the initial design with a single attribute
Dept_name and is related to only one other entity type, STUDENT. In
this case, DEPARTMENT may be reduced or demoted to an attribute of
STUDENT.

= Section 3.9 discusses choices concerning the degree of a relationship. In Chap-
ter 4, we discuss other refinements concerning specialization/generalization.

3.7.4 Alternative Notations for ER Diagrams

There are many alternative diagrammatic notations for displaying ER diagrams.
Appendix A gives some of the more popular notations. In Section 3.8, we introduce
the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation for class diagrams, which has been
proposed as a standard for conceptual object modeling.

In this section, we describe one alternative ER notation for specifying structural
constraints on relationships, which replaces the cardinality ratio (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
and single/double-line notation for participation constraints. This notation
involves associating a pair of integer numbers (min, max) with each participation
of an entity type E ina relationship type R, where 0 < min S max and max 2 1. The
numbers mean that for each entity e in E, e must participate in at least min and at
most max relationship instances in R at any point in time. In this method,
min = 0 implies partial participation, whereas min > 0 implies total participation.

Figure 3.15 displays the COMPANY database schema using the (min, max) nota-
tion.'* Usually, one uses either the cardinality ratio/single-line/double-line nota-
tion or the (min, max) notation. The (min, max) notation is more precise, and we
can use it to specify some structural constraints for relationship types of higher
degree. However, it is not sufficient for specifying some key constraints on higher-
degree relationships, as discussed in Section 3.9.

Figure 3.15 also displays all the role names for the COMPANY database schema.

'4In some notations, particularly those used in object modeling methodologies such as UML, the (min,
max) is placed on the opposite sides to the ones we have shown. For example, for the WORKS_FOR
relationship in Figure 3.15, the (1,1) would be on the DEPARTMENT side, and the (4,N) would be on the
EMPLOYEE side. Here we used the original notation from Abrial (1974).
