Chapter 30 Database Security

(2007a) also gives a brief explanation of how these attacks can be prevented from
occurring. Further proposed frameworks are discussed in Boyd and Keromytis
(2004), Halfond and Orso (2005), and McClure and Kriiger (2005).

Multilevel security is discussed in Jajodia and Sandhu (1991), Denning et al. (1987),
Smith and Winslett (1992), Stachour and Thuraisingham (1990), Lunt et al. (1990),
and Bertino et al. (2001). Overviews of research issues in database security are given
by Lunt and Fernandez (1990), Jajodia and Sandhu (1991), Bertino (1998), Castano
et al. (1995), and Thuraisingham et al. (2001). The effects of multilevel security on
concurrency control are discussed in Atluriet al. (1997). Security in next-generation,
semantic, and object-oriented databases is discussed in Rabbiti et al. (1991), Jajodia
and Kogan (1990), and Smith (1990). Oh (1999) presents a model for both discre-
tionary and mandatory security. Security models for Web-based applications and
role-based access control are discussed in Joshi et al. (2001). Security issues for
managers in the context of e-commerce applications and the need for risk assess-
ment models for selection of appropriate security control measures are discussed in
Farahmand et al. (2005). Row-level access control is explained in detail in Oracle
(2007b) and Sybase (2005). The latter also provides details on role hierarchy and
mutual exclusion. Oracle (2009) explains how Oracle uses the concept of identity
management.

Recent advances as well as future challenges for security and privacy of databases
are discussed in Bertino and Sandhu (2005). U.S. Govt. (1978), OECD (1980), and
NRC (2003) are good references on the view of privacy by important government
bodies. Karat et al. (2009) discusses a policy framework for security and privacy.
XML and access control are discussed in Naedele (2003). More details are presented
on privacy-preserving techniques in Vaidya and Clifton (2004), intellectual prop-
erty rights in Sion et al. (2004), and database survivability in Jajodia et al. (1999).
Oracle’s VPD technology and label-based security is discussed in more detail in
Oracle (2007b).

Agrawal et al. (2002) defined the concept of Hippocratic Databases for preserving
privacy in healthcare information. K-anonymity as a privacy preserving technique
is discussed in Bayardo and Agrawal (2005) and in Ciriani et al. (2007). Privacy-
preserving data mining techniques based on k-anonymity are surveyed by Ciriani
et al. (2008). Vimercati et al. (2014) discuss encryption and fragmentation as poten-
tial protection techniques for data confidentiality in the cloud.
