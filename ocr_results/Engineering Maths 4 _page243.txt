Conformal Transformations: -

If y = f(x) isa single valued function of the real variable x then for every value of
x there corresponds a value y and the set of points (x, y) describe a curve C.
This topic deals with the method of representing a complex valued function

w = f(z) geometrically.

© Definitions a

Consider a:complex valued function w = f(z). Putting z = x+i ae

w= f(z) =u(x,y)+iv(x,y). The complex quantities z = z(x, y),
w = w(u, v) are represented in two separate planes namely the z— plane and the
w— plane respectively. A point (x, y) in the z-. plane corresponds to a point
(u, v) inthe w—plane, Ifaset of points (x, y) tracesacurve C' inthe z-plane
and the corresponding points (u, v) traces a curve C’ in the w— plane, we say that
the curve C is transformed/mapped onto the curve C’ under the transformation
w = f(z). The corresponding set of points in the two planes are called images of
each other. open ®

Ifa transformation preserves the angle between any two curves both in magnitude and
sense then it is called a conformal transformation. If only the magnitude of the

angle is preserved then the transformation is called a Isogonal transformation.

The transformation is conformal if @ = 6’ as iri the following figure.
