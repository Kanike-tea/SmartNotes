15.1 Further Topics in Functional
Dependencies: Inference Rules,
Equivalence, and Minimal Cover

We introduced the concept of functional dependencies (FDs) in Section 14.2, illus-
trated it with some examples, and developed a notation to denote multiple FDs over
a single relation. We identified and discussed problematic functional dependencies
in Sections 14.3 and 14.4 and showed how they can be eliminated by a proper decom-
position of a relation. This process was described as normalization, and we showed
how to achieve the first through third normal forms (1NF through 3NF) given pri-
mary keys in Section 14.3. In Sections 14.4 and 14.5 we provided generalized tests for
2NF, 3NF, and BCNF given any number of candidate keys in a relation and showed
how to achieve them. Now we return to the study of functional dependencies and
show how new dependencies can be inferred from a given set and discuss the con-
cepts of closure, equivalence, and minimal cover that we will need when we later
consider a synthesis approach to design of relations given a set of FDs.

15.1.1 Inference Rules for Functional Dependencies

We denote by F the set of functional dependencies that are specified on relation
schema R. Typically, the schema designer specifies the functional dependencies
that are semantically obvious; usually, however, numerous other functional
dependencies hold in ail legal relation instances among sets of attributes that can
be derived from and satisfy the dependencies in F. Those other dependencies can
be inferred or deduced from the FDs in F. We call them as inferred or implied
functional dependencies.

Definition: An FD X — Y is inferred from or implied by a set of dependencies
F specified on R if X > Y holds in every legal relation state r of R; that is, when-
ever r satisfies all the dependencies in F, X > Y also holds in r.

In real life, it is impossible to specify all possible functional dependencies for a given
situation. For example, if each department has one manager, so that Dept_no
uniquely determines Mgr_ssn (Dept_no — Mgr_ssn), and a manager has a unique
phone number called Mgr_phone (Mgr_ssn > Mgr_phone), then these two dependen-
cies together imply that Dept_no > Mgr_phone. This is an inferred or implied FD
and need not be explicitly stated in addition to the two given FDs. Therefore, it is
useful to define a concept called closure formally that includes all possible depen-
dencies that can be inferred from the given set F.

Definition. Formally, the set of all dependencies that include F as well as all
dependencies that can be inferred from F is called the closure of F; it is denoted

by F*.

For example, suppose that we specify the following set F of obvious functional
dependencies on the relation schema in Figure 14.3(a):

F={Ssn — {Ename, Bdate, Address, Dnumber}, Dnumber — {Dname, Dmgr_ssn} }
