The Newton-Raphson technique applies to any equation of the form f(x) = 0, where
f(x) isa differentiable function with derivative f’(x). We start with an approximation x,
to a solution x of the equation. Then we apply the following iteration, to give us a better
approximation x;.41

Xn = Xn — (7.2)

Figure 7.3 illustrates the Newton-Raphson iteration to solve f(x) = 0.8 — x! = 0,
taking x) = 1 as our initial approximation. The first two steps are x; = 1.2 and x) = 1.248,
converging rapidly to the solution 1.25.

For many functions f, the iteration converges rapidly to the solution x. Graphically, we
place the estimate x, where the tangent to the curve at estimate x, meets the x-axis.

We will use Newton-Raphson iteration to calculate 2 d~! using only integer multipli-
cation operations. We allow the factor of 2% because this is useful when trying to estimate
2°7/d as used in Sections 7.3.2.1 and 5.10.2. Consider the following function:
