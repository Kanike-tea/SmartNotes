Database Management System [BCS403]

.. in this scheme. A computer counter has a finite maximum value, so the
system must periodically reset the counter to zero when no transactions are
executing for some short period of time.

- Another way to implement timestamps is to use the current date/time value of
the system clock and ensure that no two timestamp values are generated
during the same tick of the clock.

5.13.2 The Timestamp Ordering Algorithm

= The idea for this scheme is to order the transactions based on their
timestamps.

= A schedule in which the transactions participate is then serializable, and the
only equivalent serial schedule permitted has the transactions in order of their
timestamp values. This is called timestamp ordering (TO).

= The algorithm must ensure that, for each item accessed by conflicting

Operations in the schedule, the order in which the item is accessed does not
violate the timestamp order.

= To do this, the algorithm associates with each database item X two timestamp
(TS) values:

1. read_TS(X). The read timestamp of item X is the largest timestamp
among all the timestamps of transactions that have successfully
read item X—that is, read_TS(X) = TS(T), where T is the youngest
transaction that has read X successfully.

2. write_TS(X). The write timestamp of item X is the largest of all the

timestamps of transactions that have successfully written item X—
that is, write_TS(X) = TS(T), where T is the youngest transaction that
has written X successfully.
Basic Timestamp Ordering (TO).
= Whenever some transaction T tries to issue a read_item(X) or a write_item(X) operation,
the basic TO algorithm compares the timestamp of T with read_TS(X) and write_TS(X) to
ensure that the timestamp order of transaction execution is not violated.
= If this order is violated, then transaction T is aborted and resubmitted to the system as a
new transaction with a new timestamp.
= If Tis aborted and rolled back, any transaction 71 that may have used a value written by T

must also be rolled back.
