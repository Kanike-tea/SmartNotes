1.6. Walks and their classification 69

The following results are obvious:
(1) If acycle contains only one edge, it has to be a loop.
(2) Two parallel edges (when they occur) form a cycle.
(3) Ina simple graph, a cycle must have at least three edges. (A cycle formed by three edges
is called a triangle).

Note: While representing walks, trails, circuits, paths and cycles as sequences, only the ver-

tices in the order of their occurrence may be indicated — omitting the edges in-between them
as being understood (when there is no ambiguity).

Case of Digraphs

In the case of digraphs, the walks, trails, circuits, paths and cycles become directed walks,
directed trails, directed circuits, directed paths and directed cycles. These are defined by con-

sidering sequences of vertices and edges which are consistent with the directions of edges
present.

> (i) Open walk which is not a trail. (The edge e2 is repeated).

(ii) Trail which is not a path. (The vertex vg is repeated).

(iti) Trail which is a path.

(iv) Closed walk which is a cycle.

(¥) Closed walk which is a circuit but not a cycle. (The vertex v4 is repeated)
