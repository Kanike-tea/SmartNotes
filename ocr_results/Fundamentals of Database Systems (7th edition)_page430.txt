Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases

interfaces for DatabaseFactory and Database objects, as shown in Figure 12.8. Each
database has its own database name, and the bind operation can be used to assign
individual unique names to persistent objects in a particular database. The lookup
operation returns an object from the database that has the specified persistent
object_name, and the unbind operation removes the name of a persistent named
object from the database.

12.3.6 The Object Definition Language ODL

After our overview of the ODMG object model in the previous section, we now
show how these concepts can be utilized to create an object database schema using
the object definition language ODL.*!

The ODL is designed to support the semantic constructs of the ODMG object
model and is independent of any particular programming language. Its main use is
to create object specifications—that is, classes and interfaces. Hence, ODL is not a
programming language. A user can specify a database schema in ODL indepen-
dently of any programming language, and then use the specific language bindings
to specify how ODL constructs can be mapped to constructs in specific program-
ming languages, such as C++, Smalltalk, and Java. We will give an overview of the
C++ binding in Section 12.6.

Figure 12.9(b) shows a possible object schema for part of the UNIVERSITY data-
base, which was presented in Chapter 4. We will describe the concepts of ODL
using this example, and the one in Figure 12.11. The graphical notation for Fig-
ure 12.9(b) is shown in Figure 12.9(a) and can be considered as a variation of EER
diagrams (see Chapter 4) with the added concept of interface inheritance but
without several EER concepts, such as categories (union types) and attributes of
relationships.

Figure 12.10 shows one possible set of ODL class definitions for the UNIVERSITY
database. In general, there may be several possible mappings from an object schema
diagram (or EER schema diagram) into ODL classes. We will discuss these options
further in Section 12.4.

Figure 12.10 shows the straightforward way of mapping part of the UNIVERSITY
database from Chapter 4. Entity types are mapped into ODL classes, and inher-
itance is done using extends. However, there is no direct way to map categories
(union types) or to do multiple inheritance. In Figure 12.10 the classes
PERSON, FACULTY, STUDENT, and GRAD_STUDENT have the extents PERSONS,
FACULTY, STUDENTS, and GRAD_STUDENTS, respectively. Both FACULTY and
STUDENT extends PERSON and GRAD_STUDENT extends STUDENT. Hence, the
collection of STUDENTS (and the collection of FACULTY) will be constrained to
bea subset of the collection of PERSONs at any time. Similarly, the collection of

2'The ODL syntax and data types are meant to be compatible with the Interface Definition language
(IDL) of CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture), with extensions for relationships and
other database concepts.
