Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity—Relationship (EER) Model

database information does. One ongoing project that is attempting to allow
information exchange among computers on the Web is called the Semantic
Web, which attempts to create knowledge representation models that are quite
general in order to allow meaningful information exchange and search among
machines. The concept of ontology is considered to be the most promising basis
for achieving the goals of the Semantic Web and is closely related to knowledge
representation. In this section, we give a brief introduction to what ontology is
and how it can be used as a basis to automate information understanding, search,
and exchange.

The study of ontologies attempts to describe the concepts and relationships that are
possible in reality through some common vocabulary; therefore, it can be consid-
ered as a way to describe the knowledge of a certain community about reality.
Ontology originated in the fields of philosophy and metaphysics. One commonly
used definition of ontology is a specification of a conceptualization.'*

In this definition, a conceptualization is the set of concepts and relationships that
are used to represent the part of reality or knowledge that is of interest to a com-
munity of users. Specification refers to the language and vocabulary terms that are
used to specify the conceptualization. The ontology includes both specification and
conceptualization. For example, the same conceptualization may be specified in two
different languages, giving two separate ontologies. Based on this general defini-
tion, there is no consensus on what an ontology is exactly. Some possible ways to
describe ontologies are as follows:

= A thesaurus (or even a dictionary or a glossary of terms) describes the rela-
tionships between words (vocabulary) that represent various concepts.

= A taxonomy describes how concepts of a particular area of knowledge
are related using structures similar to those used in a specialization or
generalization.

= A detailed database schema is considered by some to be an ontology that
describes the concepts (entities and attributes) and relationships of a mini-
world from reality.

= A logical theory uses concepts from mathematical logic to try to define con-
cepts and their interrelationships.

Usually the concepts used to describe ontologies are similar to the concepts we dis-
cuss in conceptual modeling, such as entities, attributes, relationships, specializa-
tions, and so on. The main difference between an ontology and, say, a database
schema, is that the schema is usually limited to describing a small subset of a mini-
world from reality in order to store and manage data. An ontology is usually con-
sidered to be more general in that it attempts to describe a part of reality or a
domain of interest (for example, medical terms, electronic-commerce applications,
sports, and so on) as completely as possible.
