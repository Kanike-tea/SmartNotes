Concurrency Control
Techniques

n this chapter, we discuss a number of concurrency

control techniques that are used to ensure the nonin-
terference or isolation property of concurrently executing transactions. Most of
these techniques ensure serializability of schedules—which we defined in Sec-
tion 21.5—using concurrency control protocols (sets of rules) that guarantee serializ-
ability. One important set of protocols—known as two-phase locking protocols—
employs the technique of locking data items to prevent multiple transactions from
accessing the items concurrently; a number of locking protocols are described in
Sections 21.1 and 21.3.2. Locking protocols are used in some commercial DBMSs,
but they are considered to have high overhead. Another set of concurrency control
protocols uses timestamps. A timestamp is a unique identifier for each transaction,
generated by the system. Timestamp values are generated in the same order as the
transaction start times. Concurrency control protocols that use timestamp ordering
to ensure serializability are introduced in Section 21.2. In Section 21.3, we discuss
multiversion concurrency control protocols that use multiple versions of a data
item. One multiversion protocol extends timestamp order to multiversion time-
stamp ordering (Section 21.3.1), and another extends timestamp order to two-
phase locking (Section 21.3.2). In Section 21.4, we present a protocol based on the
concept of validation or certification of a transaction after it executes its opera-
tions; these are sometimes called optimistic protocols, and they also assume that
multiple versions of a data item can exist. In Section 21.4, we discuss a protocol that
is based on the concept of snapshot isolation, which can utilize techniques similar
to those proposed in validation-based and multiversion methods; these protocols
are used in a number of commercial DBMSs and in certain cases are considered to
have lower overhead than locking-based protocols.
