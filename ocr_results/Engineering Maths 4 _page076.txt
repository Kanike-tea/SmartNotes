This is the required series soution of the given de.

Remark: Comparison with the analytical solution.

We have (D? - 1 )y = 0, where D = ae
Auxilary equation is m?-1 = Oand hence m = +1 are its roots.
The analytical soution is given by y = qe toe * cal)

The series solution obtained by us can be represented as
