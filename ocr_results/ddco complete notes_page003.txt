THEOREM l(a): x + x= x.

Statement Justification
x+x=(x+x).1 postulate 2(b)
= (x +x) +x) 5(a)
=xt xx’ 4(b)
=x+0 5(b)
=x 2(a)

THEOREM l(b): x.x=x.

Statement Justification

X.X=xx+0 postulate 2(a)
= xx + xx' 5(b)
= x(x + x’) 4(a)
=x.1 5S(a)
=x 2(b)

Note that theorem 1(b) is the dual of theorem 1(a) and that each step of the proof in
part (b) is the dual of its counterpart in part (a)..

THEOREM 2(a): x + 1 = 1.
Statement Justification

x+1=1.(x+1) postulate 2(b)

= (x + x')(x + 1) 5S(a)
=xtx'.1 4(b)
=xtx' 2(b)
=1 5(a)

THEOREM 2(b): x .0O=0 by duality.

THEOREM 3: (x’)' = x. From postulate 5, we have x + x' = 1 and x. x’ = O, which
together define the complement of x. The complement of x' is x and is also (x’)'.

Therefore, since the complement is unique, we have (x’)' = x. The theorems involving two
or three variables may be proven algebraically from the postulates and the theorems
that have already been proven.

THEOREM 6(a): x + xy =x.

Statement Justification

x+xy=x.1+xy postulate 2(b)
=x(1+y) 4(a)
