SECRETARY—are attached to the rectangle representing that subclass. These are called specific

attributes (or local attributes) of the subclass.

Similarly, a subclass can participate in specific relationship types, such as_ the
HOURLY_EMPLOYEE subclass participating in the BELONGS_TO relationship in Figure
Figure 3.8.1(b).

Figure 3.8.1(b): Instances of a specialization

Figure 3.8.1 (b) shows a few entity instances that belong to subclasses of the {SECRETARY,
ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN} specialization. An entity that belongs to a subclass represents the
same real-world entity as the entity connected to it in the EMPLOYEE superclass, even though the
same entity is shown twice; for example, e1 is shown in both EMPLOYEE and SECRETARY.
There are two main reasons for including class/subclass relationships and specializations in a data
model.

« The first is that certain attributes may apply to some but not all entities of the superclass. A
subclass is defined in order to group the entities to which these attributes apply. The
members of the subclass may still share the majority of their attributes with the other
members of the superclass.

= The second reason for using subclasses is that some relationship types may be participated
in only by entities that are members of the subclass. For example, if only

HOURLY_EMPLOYEES can belong to a trade union, we can represent that fact by
