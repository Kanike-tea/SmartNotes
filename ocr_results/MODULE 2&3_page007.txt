2.4 Using the Barrel Shifter with Arithmetic Instructions

The wide range of second operand shifts available on arithmetic and logical instructions is a
very powerful feature of the ARM instruction set. Example shown illustrates the use of the
inline barrel shifter with an arithmetic instruction. The instruction multiplies the value stored

in register rl by three.
Example:
ADD r0,rl,r1,LSL #1; 10=rl +rl *2

Register rl is first shifted one location to the left to give the value of twice rl. The ADD
instruction then adds the result of the barrel shift operation to register rl. The final result

transferred into register r0 is equal to three times the value stored in register rl.

PRE 10 = 0x00000000, rl = 0x00000005 POST 10 = 0x0000000F, rl = 0x00000005
2.5 Logical Instructions

Logical instructions perform bitwise logical operations on the two source registers.

Syntax: <instruction>{<cond>}{S} Rd, Rn, N

AND | logical bitwise AND of two 32-bit values Rd = Rn& N
ORR | logical bitwise OR of two 32-bit values Rd = Rn|N
EOR | logical exclusive OR of two 32-bit values Rd = Rn“ N
BIC | logical bit clear (AND NOT) Rd = Rn& ~N

Example 1:

ORR r0,rl1,r2; r0=rl OR r2
This example shows a logical OR operation between registers rl and r2. r0 holds the result.
PRE 10 = 0x00000000, rl = 0x02040608, r2 = 0x10305070 POST 10 = 0x12345678
Example 2:

BIC r0,r1,r2;
