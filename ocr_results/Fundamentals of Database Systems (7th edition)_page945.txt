25.1 What Is Big Data?

Velocity. The definition of big data goes beyond the dimension of volume; it
includes the types and frequency of data that are disruptive to traditional database
management tools. The Mckinsey report on big data’ described velocity as the
speed at which data is created, accumulated, ingested, and processed. High velocity
is attributed to data when we consider the typical speed of transactions on stock
exchanges; this speed reaches billions of transactions per day on certain days. If we
must process these transactions to detect potential fraud or we must process bil-
lions of call records on cell phones daily to detect malicious activity, we face the
velocity dimension. Real-time data and streaming data are accumulated by the likes
of Twitter and Facebook at a very high velocity. Velocity is helpful in detecting
trends among people that are tweeting a million tweets every three minutes. Pro-
cessing of streaming data for analysis also involves the velocity dimension.

Variety. Sources of data in traditional applications were mainly transactions
involving financial, insurance, travel, healthcare, retail industries, and governmen-
tal and judicial processing. The types of sources have expanded dramatically and
include Internet data (e.g., clickstream and social media), research data (e.g., sur-
veys and industry reports), location data (e.g., mobile device data and geospatial
data), images (e.g., surveillance, satellites and medical scanning), e-mails, supply
chain data (e.g., EDI—electronic data interchange, vendor catalogs), signal data
(e.g. sensors and RFID devices), and videos (YouTube enters hundreds of minutes
of video every minute). Big data includes structured, semistructured, and unstruc-
tured data (see discussion in Chapter 26) in different proportions based on context.

Structured data feature a formally structured data model, such as the relational
model, in which data are in the form of tables containing rows and columns, and a
hierarchical database in IMS, which features record types as segments and fields
within a record.

Unstructured data have no identifiable formal structure. We discussed systems like
MongoDB (in Chapter 24), which stores unstructured document-oriented data,
and Neo4j, which stores data in the form of a graph. Other forms of unstructured
data include e-mails and blogs, PDF files, audio, video, images, clickstreams, and
Web contents. The advent of the World Wide Web in 1993-1994 led to tremen-
dous growth in unstructured data. Some forms of unstructured data may fit into a
format that allows well-defined tags that separate semantic elements; this format
may include the capability to enforce hierarchies within the data. XML is hierarchi-
cal in its descriptive mechanism, and various forms of XML have come about in
many domains; for example, biology (bioML—biopolymer markup language), GIS
(gML—geography markup language), and brewing (BeerXML—language for
exchange of brewing data), to name a few. Unstructured data constitutes the major
challenge in today’s big data systems.

Veracity. The veracity dimension of big data is a more recent addition than the

advent of the Internet. Veracity has two built-in features: the credibility of the
source, and the suitability of data for its target audience. It is closely related to trust;
