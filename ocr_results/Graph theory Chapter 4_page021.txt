For the graph H shown in Figure 4.36 find the vertex-partitions caused by the

following cut-sets. ;

(1) Ci =fe2,e3} (2) Ga = {e1,¢3,e6} (3) C= {e3,€4, €6,€7}

The disconnected parts of H caused by the cut-set Ci are got by removing from the

»(l)
edges that belong to Cy. These parts are shown below.
