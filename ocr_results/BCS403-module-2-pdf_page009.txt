Database Management System [BCS403]

A database state that does not obey all the integrity constraints is called Invalid state and a state that

satisfies all the constraints in the defined set of integrity constraints IC is called a Valid state

Attributes that represent the same real-world concept may or may not have identical names in
different relations. For example, the Dnumber attribute in both DEPARTMENT and
DEPT_LOCATIONS stands for the same real-world concept—the number given to a department.
That same concept is called Dno in EMPLOYEE and Dnum in PROJECT.

Alternatively, attributes that represent different concepts may have the same name in different
relations. For example, we could have used the attribute name Name for both Pname of PROJECT
and Dname of DEPARTMENT; in this case, we would have two attributes that share the same name

but represent different realworld concepts—project names and department names.

1.2.4 Integrity, Referential Integrity, and Foreign Keys

Entity integrity constraint

The entity integrity constraint states that no primary key value can be NULL. This is because the
primary key value is used to identify individual tuples in a relation. Having NULL values for the
primary key implies that we cannot identify some tuples. For example, if two or more tuples had
NULL for their primary keys, we may not be able to distinguish them if we try to reference them
from other relations.

Key constraints and entity integrity constraints are specified on individual relations.

Referential integrity constraint

The referential integrity constraint is specified between two relations and is used to maintain the
consistency among tuples in the two relations. Informally, the referential integrity constraint states
that a tuple in one relation that refers to another relation must refer to an existing tuple in that
relation.

For example COMPANY database, the attribute Dno of EMPLOYEE gives the department number
for which each employee works; hence, its value in every EMPLOYEE tuple must match the

Dnumber value of some tuple in the DEPARTMENT relation.
