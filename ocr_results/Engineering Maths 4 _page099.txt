Further, the solution fork = —1, (in respect of Yo ) be denoted by J_,, (*).
Hence the general solution of the Bessel’s equation is given by
y= aj, (x) +B), (x) .
where a and b sine arbitrary constants and 7 is not an integer. °°"

Consider the differential equation

Pah ee yao : re Orme

We shall show that this equation is reducible to'the form of Bessel equation.
Putting t = 4.x we have, :

dy _ dy-dt dy
dx dt dx dt

de dx \ dx dx | dt dt ("dt ) ax ae

Substituting these results along with. x= aa in (1) we obtain,

This is in the form of Bessel differential equation whose solution is given by
y =aJ,(t) + by, CE). ; \
‘Thus y=aJ,(Ax) + bJ_, (Ax) is the solution of equation (1).
