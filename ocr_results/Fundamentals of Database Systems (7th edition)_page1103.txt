28.2 Association Rules

= Classification hierarchies. The goal is to work from an existing set of events
or transactions to create a hierarchy of classes. Examples: (1) A population
may be divided into five ranges of credit worthiness based on a history of
previous credit transactions. (2) A model may be developed for the factors
that determine the desirability of a store location on a 1-10 scale. (3) Mutual
funds may be classified based on performance data using characteristics
such as growth, income, and stability.

= Sequential patterns. A sequence of actions or events is sought. Example: If
a patient underwent cardiac bypass surgery for blocked arteries and an
aneurysm and later developed high blood urea within a year of surgery, he
or she is likely to suffer from kidney failure within the next 18 months.
Detecting sequential patterns is equivalent to detecting associations among
events with certain temporal relationships.

= Patterns within time series. Similarities can be detected within positions of
a time series of data, which is a sequence of data taken at regular intervals,
such as daily sales or daily closing stock prices. Examples: (1) Stocks of a
utility company, ABC Power, and a financial company, XYZ Securities,
showed the same pattern during 2014 in terms of closing stock prices. (2) Two
products show the same selling pattern in summer but a different one in
winter. (3) A pattern in solar magnetic wind may be used to predict changes
in Earth’s atmospheric conditions.

= Clustering. A given population of events or items can be partitioned (seg-
mented) into sets of “similar” elements. Examples: (1) An entire population
of treatment data on a disease may be divided into groups based on the sim-
ilarity of side effects produced. (2) The adult population in the United States
may be categorized into five groups from most likely to buy to least likely to
buy a new product. (3) The Web accesses made by a collection of users
against a set of documents (say, in a digital library) may be analyzed in terms
of the keywords of documents to reveal clusters or categories of users.

For most applications, the desired knowledge is a combination of the above types.
We expand on each of the above knowledge types in the following sections.

28.2 Association Rules

28.2.1 Market-Basket Model, Support, and Confidence

One of the major technologies in data mining involves the discovery of association
rules. The database is regarded as a collection of transactions, each involving a set of
items. A common example is that of market-basket data. Here the market basket
corresponds to the sets of items a consumer buys in a supermarket during one visit.
Consider four such transactions in a random sample shown in Figure 28.1.

An association rule is of the form X => Y, where X = {x), X, ... ,Xn},and Y= {y, y2,
++ > Ym} are sets of items, with x; and y; being distinct items for all i and all j. This
