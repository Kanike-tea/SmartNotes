Leaf nodes P, D, and E represent the three relations PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, and EMPLOYEE.

The relational algebra operations in the expression are represented by internal tree nodes. The query
tree signifies an explicit order of execution in the following sense. The node marked (1) must begin
execution before node (2) because some resulting tuples of operation (1) must be available before
we can begin to execute operation (2). Similarly, node (2) must begin to execute and produce results

before node (3) can start execution, and so on.

A query tree gives a good visual representation and understanding of the query in terms of the
relational operations it uses and is recommended as an additional means for expressing queries in

relational algebra.
