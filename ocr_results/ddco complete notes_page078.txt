2. BUS STRUCTURE

Bus is defined as set of parallel wires used for data communication between different parts of
computer. Each wire carries | bit of data. There are 3 types of buses, namely

1. Address bus

2. Data bus and

3. Control bus1!.
1. Address bus :

. It is unidirectional.

. The processor (CPU) sends the address of an I/O device of Memory device by means of
this bus.

2. Data bus

. It is a bidirectional bus.

. The CPU sends data from Memory to CPU and vice versa as welljas from I/O to CPU
and vice versa by means of this bus.

3. Control bus:

a This bus carries control signals for Memory and\I/O devices. It generates control signals
for Memory namely MEMRD and MEMWR and control signals for I/O devices namely IORD
and IOWR.

The structure of single bus organization is as\shown in the figure.

J NY Muar, =

. The I/O devices, Memory and CPU are connected to this bus is as shown in the figure.
. It establishes communication between two devices, at a time.

Features of Single bus organization are
> Less Expensive
> Flexible to connect I/O devices.
> Poor performance due to single bus.
There is a variation in the devices connected to this bus in terms of speed of operation.
Few devices like keyboard, are very slow. Devices like optical disk are faster. Memory and
processor are faster, but all these devices uses the same bus. Hence to provide the synchronization
between two devices, a buffer register is attached to each device. It holds the data temporarily
during the data transfer between two devices.
