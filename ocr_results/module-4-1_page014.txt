Data Structures and Applications (15CS33)

C function for testing equality of a binary tree:

int equal(treepointer first,treepointer second)

{
return((!first && !second) ll (first && second && (first—>data==second—data)
&& equal(first—leftchild,second—leftchild) && equal(first—rightchild,
second—rightchild))

}

This function will return TRUE if two trees are equivalent and FALSE if they are not.

3. The Satisfiability problem
e Consider the formula that is constructed by set of variables: x1, x2, ..., Xn and operators
a(and), v(or), 7 (not).
e The variables can hold only of two possible values, true or false.
e The expression can form using these variables and operators is defined by the
following rules.
e A variable is an expression
e If xand yare expressions, then 7x, xy, xvy are expressions
e Parentheses can be used to alter the normal order of evaluation (2 > ~>v)

Example: x1 V (X2 A 7X3) If x: and x3 are false and xis true
= false v (true A 7false)
= false v true
= true

The satisfiablity problem for formulas of the propositional calculus asks if there is an

assignment of values to the variable that causes the value of the expression to be true.

Let’s assume the formula in a binary tree

(x1 A 7X2) V (4X1 A x3) V 9X3
