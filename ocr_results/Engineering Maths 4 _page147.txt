Sine z=xtiyorz=ré® we always write
w = f(z) = u(x, y)tiv(x, y) [Carnal fang
w= f(z)=u(r, 0)+iv(r, @) ‘{Polar form] ,
Examples :
1, Consider f(z) = 2 . :
bei, utiv= (xtiy) = 2 42xiy+ 23? .
or utiv = (x -y¥)+i(2xy)-
> u=x-y¥ and v= 2xy in the cartesian fori,
Also in the polar form f(z) = (rd?) = (rd®y?
ie,  utiv= Pei?
= 7 (cos26+isin20)
’ = u = cos26 and v = r’sin20 . i
2. Consider f(z) = logz ;
It is convenient to find u and v inthe polar form by taking z = ré® :
Wehave, u+iv = log(ré®) = logr+i@ loge.’ But loge = 1°
utiv = logr+i0 rc a,
=> u = logr and v = @ inthe polar form.
Since we know that r = Vey and 0 = tan (y/x)" Spee
u= log Vie +? and v = tare} (y/x), invthisccovtenianedolta,

Limit : A complex valued function f(z) defined in the neighbourhood of a point
2 is said to havea ‘limit | as z terids to 2 if for every © > 0 however small’
there exists a positive real number § such that | f(z)-I| <e

when |z-2,| < 6. Thisis written as lim f(z) = T

Continuity: A complex valued function f(z)'issaid'tobe continuous at z = z,

0
f(%) exists and lim f(z) = f(%).
