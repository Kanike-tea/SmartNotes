be identical to the previous tuple version. An alternative approach can be used
in database systems that support complex structured objects, such as object
databases (see Chapter 11) or object-relational systems. This approach is called
attribute versioning.

In attribute versioning, a single complex object is used to store all the temporal
changes of the object. Each attribute that changes over time is called a time-
varying attribute, and it has its values versioned over time by adding temporal
periods to the attribute. The temporal periods may represent valid time, transac-
tion time, or bitemporal, depending on the application requirements. Attributes
that do not change over time are called non-time-varying and are not associated
with the temporal periods. To illustrate this, consider the example in Fig-
ure 26.10, which is an attribute-versioned valid time representation of EMPLOYEE

class TEMPORAL_SALARY

{ attribute Date Valid_start_time;
attribute Date Valid_end_time;
attribute float Salary;

‘

class TEMPORAL_DEPT

{attribute Date Valid_start_time;
attribute Date Valid_end_time;
attribute © DEPARTMENT_VT Dept;

‘

class TEMPORAL_SUPERVISOR

{ attribute Date Valid_start_time;
attribute Date Valid_end_time;
attribute EMPLOYEE_VT Supervisor;

‘

class TEMPORAL_LIFESPAN
{ attribute Date Valid_ start time;
attribute Date Valid end time;

‘

class EMPLOYEE_VT
(| extent EMPLOYEES )

{attribute _list<TEMPORAL_LIFESPAN> lifespan;

attribute string Ssn;
attribute —_list<TEMPORAL_SALARY> Sal_history;
attribute —_list<TEMPORAL_DEPT> Dept_history;

attribute list <TEMPORAL_SUPERVISOR> _ Supervisor_history;
