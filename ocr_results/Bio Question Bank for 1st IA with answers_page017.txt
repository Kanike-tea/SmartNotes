11. Explain in detail the properties & function of hormones in human body.

Ans. Properties of Hormones

1. Chemical Nature — Hormones can be proteins, peptides, steroids, or amines.

feedback (e.g., insulin & glucose levels).

Specificity — Each hormone affects only specific target cells with corresponding receptors.
Low Concentration, High Effect - Hormones are effective in minute quantities.

Regulation by Feedback Mechanism — Hormone secretion is often controlled by negative

5. Transport in Blood — Some hormones are water-soluble (e.g., peptide hormones) and travel

freely in blood, while lipid-soluble hormones (e.g., steroid hormones) require carrier proteins.

6. Short or Long-Term Effects — Some hormones act quickly (e.g., adrenaline), while others have

long-term effects (e.g., growth hormone).
