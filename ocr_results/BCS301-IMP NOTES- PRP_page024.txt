where —00 <x <0 , —co <p < oo and here ,0*(> 0) are called the mean and variance of the
normal distribution i.e., widely used in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, data analysis, i.e., to analysis
the data when there is an equal chance for the data to be above and below the average value of the
continuous data. The normal is also known as Gaussian distribution (or) Probability Bell Curve. The normal
distribution is a probability distribution i.e., symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are
more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

The normal distribution follows as,

“P(a<x<b) =f? fax
