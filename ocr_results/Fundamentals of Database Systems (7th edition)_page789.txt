20.4 Characterizing Schedules Based
on Recoverability

When transactions are executing concurrently in an interleaved fashion, then the
order of execution of operations from all the various transactions is known as a
schedule (or history). In this section, first we define the concept of schedules, and
then we characterize the types of schedules that facilitate recovery when failures
occur. In Section 20.5, we characterize schedules in terms of the interference of
participating transactions; this discussion leads to the concepts of serializability and
serializable schedules.

20.4.1 Schedules (Histories) of Transactions

A schedule (or history) S of n transactions T), T, ... , T, is an ordering of the
operations of the transactions. Operations from different transactions can be
interleaved in the schedule S$. However, for each transaction T; that participates
in the schedule S, the operations of T; in S must appear in the same order in
which they occur in T;. The order of operations in S is considered to be a total
ordering, meaning that for any two operations in the schedule, one must occur
before the other. It is possible theoretically to deal with schedules whose opera-
tions form partial orders, but we will assume for now total ordering of the opera-
tions in a schedule.

For the purpose of recovery and concurrency control, we are mainly interested in
the read_item and write_item operations of the transactions, as well as the commit and
abort operations. A shorthand notation for describing a schedule uses the symbols
b, r, w, e, c, and a for the operations begin_transaction, read_item, write_item,
end_transaction, commit, and abort, respectively, and appends as a subscript the
transaction id (transaction number) to each operation in the schedule. In this
notation, the database item X that is read or written follows the r and w operations
in parentheses. In some schedules, we will only show the read and write operations,
whereas in other schedules we will show additional operations, such as commit or
abort. The schedule in Figure 20.3(a), which we shall call S,, can be written as follows
in this notation:

Sai 11(X)s r2(X)s wi(X)s (Ys wo(X)s wi (¥)s

Similarly, the schedule for Figure 20.3(b), which we call S,, can be written as fol-
lows, if we assume that transaction T, aborted after its read_item(Y) operation:

Sue ry(X)3 wi(X)5 12(X)s w2(X)5 (V5 ans

Conflicting Operations in a Schedule. Two operations in a schedule are said to
conflict if they satisfy all three of the following conditions: (1) they belong to differ-
ent transactions; (2) they access the same item X; and (3) at least one of the opera-
tions is a write_item(X). For example, in schedule S,, the operations r;(X) and w2(X)
conflict, as do the operations r(X) and w;(X), and the operations w;(X) and w2(X).
However, the operations r;(X) and r,(X) do not conflict, since they are both read
