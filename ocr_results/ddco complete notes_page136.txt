downstream must be passed along. For example, during clock cycle 4, the
information in the buffers is as follows:

Buffer B1 holds instruction 13, which was fetched in cycle 3 and is being
decoded by the instruction-decoding unit.

Buffer B2 holds both the source operands for instruction I2 and the
specification of the operation to be performed. This is the information
produced by the decoding hardware in cycle 3. The buffer also holds the
information needed for the write step of instruction I2 (stepW2). Even though
it is not needed by stage E, this information must be passed on to stage W
in the following clock cycle to enable that stage to perform the required Write
operation.

Buffer B3 holds the results produced by the execution unit and the
destination information for instruction 11.

Role of Cache Memory

Each stage in a pipeline is expected to complete its operation in one clock
cycle. Hence, the clock period should be sufficiently long to complete
the task being performed in any stage. If different units require different
amounts of time, the clock period must allow the longest task to be
completed. A unit that completes its task early is idle for the remainder of
the clock period. Hence, pipelining is most effective in improving
performance if the tasks being performed in different stages require about
the same amount of time. This consideration is particularly important for the
instruction fetch step, which is assigned one clock period in Figure a. The
clock cycle has to be equal to or greater than the time needed to complete a
fetch operation. However, the access time of the main memory may be as
much as ten times greater than the time needed to perform basic pipeline
stage operations inside the processor, such as adding two numbers. Thus, if
each instruction fetch required access to the main memory, pipelining
would be of little value.

The use of cache memories solves the memory access problem. In
particular, when a cache is included on the same chip as the processor,
access time to the cache is usually the same as the time needed to perform
other basic operations inside the processor. This makes it possible to divide
instruction fetching and processing into steps that are more or less equal in
duration. Each of these steps is performed by a different pipeline stage, and
the clock period is chosen to correspond to the longest one.
