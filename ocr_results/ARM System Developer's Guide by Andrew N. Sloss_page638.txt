A.4 ARM Assembler Quick Reference 625

AREA attributes.

Attribute Meaning

ALIGN=<expression> Align the ELF section to a 2°?"*!0 byte boundary.
ASSOC=<sectionname> If this section is linked, also link <sect i onname>.
CODE The section contains instructions and is read only.
DATA The section contains data and is read write.
NOINIT The data section does not require initialization.
READONLY The section is read only.

READWRITE The section is read write.

ASSERT

ASSERT <logical-expression>

Assemble time assert. If the logical expression is false, then assembly terminates with an
error.

CN

<name> CN <numeric-expression>

Set <name> to be an alias for coprocessor register <numeric-expression>.

CODE16, CODE32

CODE16 tells the assembler to assemble the following instructions as 16-bit Thumb
instructions. CODE32 indicates 32-bit ARM instructions (the default for armasm).

cp

<name> CP <numeric-expression>

Set <name> to be an alias for coprocessor number <numeric-expression>.

DATA
<label> DATA

The DATA directive indicates that the label points to data rather than code. In Thumb
mode this prevents the linker from setting the bottom bit of the label. Bit 0 of a
function pointer or code label is 0 for ARM code and 1 for Thumb code (see the BX
instruction).
