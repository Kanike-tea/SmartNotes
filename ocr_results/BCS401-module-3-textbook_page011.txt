dominance holds for the key in this node: If it does not, the algorithm exchanges
the node’s key K with the larger key of its children and checks whether the
parental dominance holds for K in its new position. This process continues until
the parental dominance for K is satisfied. (Eventually, it has to because it holds
automatically for any key in a leaf.) After completing the “heapification” of the
subtree rooted at the current parental node, the algorithm proceeds to do the same
for the node’s immediate predecessor. The algorithm stops after this is done for
the root of the tree.

How efficient is this algorithm in the worst case? Assume, for simplicity,
that n =2* — 1 so that a heap’s tree is full, i-e., the largest possible number of
