5. What is DNA origami? Explain the process of DNA origami.

Ans. DNA origami is a technique used in nanotechnology where a long single strand of DNA
is folded into specific shapes and structures at the nanoscale with the help of many short
complementary strands. This method allows scientists to build precise and complex 2D and 3D
nanostructures using the self-assembly property of DNA. The term "origami" is borrowed from
the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, as DNA strands are similarly folded into desired

shapes.

The process of DNA origami involves a long scaffold strand, usually derived from viral DNA
(like the M13 bacteriophage), and hundreds of short staple strands which are designed to bind
to specific parts of the scaffold. These staple strands are synthetically created to be
complementary to certain regions of the scaffold strand. When all the strands are mixed
together under appropriate conditions (such as temperature and salt concentration), the staple
strands bind to their target sequences on the scaffold strand, effectively folding it into the

intended shape.

The typical steps in the DNA origami process are as follows:

1. Designing the Structure: Scientists first decide the shape or pattern they want to
create, such as a smiley face, a box, or a 3D cube. This design is then translated into a
DNA folding map using specialized computer software.

2. Choosing the Scaffold Strand: A long single-stranded DNA molecule is chosen as the
base scaffold. The M13 viral DNA is commonly used due to its suitable length (about
7,000 bases) and availability.

3. Designing Staple Strands: Short DNA strands, called staple strands, are designed to
bind to specific sections of the scaffold strand. Each staple brings two parts of the
scaffold together, causing it to fold.

4. Mixing and Annealing: The scaffold and staple strands are mixed in a solution and

heated to separate any unwanted bindings. Then, the mixture is slowly cooled
