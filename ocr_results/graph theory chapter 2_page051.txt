We have proved that a graph with m= & +1 vertices is S-colourable if a graph with aS
vertices is S-colourable. Hence, by induction, it follows that a graph with 7 vertices, Where ,
is any positive integer, is 5-colourable.

This completes the proof of the theorem.

Four Colour Problem ]

Now, having proved that every simple connected planar graph is properly colourable wit,

5 colours, the question that arises is: Is it possible to properly colour such a graph with jex
4 colours? This question was first posed in 1852 and was called the Four Colour Problen,
This problem remained unsolved for over a century. Based on the experience gained by th
colouring of innumerable graphs, it was believed that the solution to the problem must be in
the affirmative and the problem was termed the Four Colour Conjecture. The question was
eventually settled by two American mathematicians, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in
1976. After several years of work and a substantial amount of computer time, they came oul
with a proof that established the truth of the four colour conjecture. In effect, they proved the
following theorem, now known as the

Four Colour Theorem: Every simple, connected planar graph is 4-colourable.

This is equivalent to saying that every map can be properly coloured with just four colow’s.
The proof of this Theorem is beyond the scope of the textbook literature.
