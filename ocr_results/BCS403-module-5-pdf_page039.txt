Examples in Hbase. (a) Creating a table called EMPLOYEE with three column families: Name, Address, and Details.
(b) Inserting some in the EMPLOYEE table; different rows can have different self-describing column qualifiers
(Fname, Lname, Nickname, Mname, Minit, Suffix, ... for column family Name; Job, Review, Supervisor, Salary

for column family Details). (c) Some CRUD operations of Hbase.

(a) creating a table:
create ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘Name’, ‘Address’, ‘Details’
(b) inserting some row data in the EMPLOYEE table:
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1', ‘Name:Fname’, ‘John’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1', ‘Name:Lname’, ‘Smith’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Name:Nickname’, Johnny’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Details:Job’, ‘Engineer’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Details:Review’, ‘Good’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Name:Fname’, ‘Alicia’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2', ‘Name:Lname', ‘Zelaya’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Name:MName', ‘Jennifer’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Details:Job’, ‘DBA’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Details:Supervisor'’, ‘James Borg’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Fname’, ‘James’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Minit’, ‘E’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Lname', ‘Borg’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Suffix’, ‘Ir.’
put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Details:Job’, ‘CEO"
put ‘EMPLOYEE, ‘row’, ‘Details:Salary’, ‘1,000,000!

(c) Some Hbase basic CRUD operations:
Creating a table: create <tablename>, <column family>, <column family>, ...
Inserting Data: put <tablename>, <rowid>, <column family>:<column qualifier>, <value>
Reading Data (all data in a table): scan <tablename>
Retrieve Data (one item): get <tablename>,<rowid>

the user to define the timestamp value explicitly in a Date format rather than
using the system-generated timestamp.

= Cells. A cell holds a basic data item in Hbase. The key (address) of a cell is
specified by a combination of (table, rowid, columnfamily, columnqualifier,
timestamp). If timestamp is left out, the latest version of the item is retrieved
unless a default number of versions is specified, say the latest three versions.
The default number of versions to be retrieved, as well as the default number
of versions that the system needs to keep, are parameters that can be speci-
fied during table creation.

= Namespaces. A namespace is a collection of tables. A namespace basically
specifies a collection of one or more tables that are typically used together by
user applications, and it corresponds to a database that contains a collection
of tables in relational terminology.
