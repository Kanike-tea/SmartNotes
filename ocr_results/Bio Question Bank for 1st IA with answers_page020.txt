e ATP synthase: An enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from
ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate. It is found in the mitochondria of cells.

2) Transporting molecules

e Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that transports oxygen from the
lungs to the tissues in the body.

e Albumin: Albumin is a protein found in blood plasma that helps transport various substances such
as hormones, fatty acids, and drugs throughout the body.

e Transferrin: Transferrin is a protein that transports iron in the blood from the site of absorption in
the gut to the bone marrow, liver, and other tissues that require it.

e Apolipoproteins: Apolipoproteins are a family of proteins that transport lipids (fats) in the
bloodstream. Examples include ApoA, ApoB, and ApoE.

e Ferritin: Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in a non-toxic form in the liver, spleen, and bone
marrow.

e Glut transporters: Glut transporters are a family of proteins that transport glucose and other sugars
across cell membranes. Examples include GLUT1 and GLUT4.

3) Providing mechanical support

e Collagen: Collagen is the main structural protein in the body and provides support to tissues such
as skin, tendons, cartilage, bone, and teeth.

e Elastin: Elastin is a protein that provides elasticity and stretchability to tissues such as skin, lungs,
arteries, and ligaments.

e Keratin: Keratin is a protein that forms the structural basis of hair, nails, and the outer layer of
skin.

e Actin and Myosin: Actin and myosin are proteins that are involved in muscle contraction and
provide the mechanical force required for movement.

e Tubulin: Tubulin is a protein that forms the structural basis of microtubules, which provide support
to cells and are involved in various cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular
transport.

e Laminin: Laminin is a protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix and provides structural
support to cells in tissues such as skin, muscles, and organs. And

4) Regulating cell behaviour
e Receptor proteins: Receptor proteins are proteins that are located on the surface of cells and bind

to specific signaling molecules such as hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters. When
