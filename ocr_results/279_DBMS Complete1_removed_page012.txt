LECTURE-S: ER-MODEL

Data Model:
The data model describes the structure of a database. It is a collection of conceptual tools for
describing data, data relationships and consistency constraints and various types of data models
such as

1. Object based logical model

2. Record based logical model

3. Physical model

Types of data model:
1. Object based logical model
a. ER-model

b. Functional model
c. Object oriented model
d. Semantic model
2. Record based logical model
a. Hierarchical database model
b. Network model
c. Relational model
3. Physical model

Entity Relationship Model (ER Model

The entity-relationship data model perceives the real world as consisting of basic objects, called
entities and relationships among these objects. It was developed to facilitate database design by
allowing specification of an enterprise schema which represents the overall logical structure of a
data base.

Main Features of ER-MODEL:

e Entity relationship model is a high level conceptual model

e It allows us to describe the data involved in a real world enterprise in terms of objects and
their relationships.

e It is widely used to develop an initial design of a database

e It provides a set of useful concepts that make it convenient for a developer to move from a
basic set of information to a detailed and description of information that can be easily
implemented in a database system

e It describes data as a collection of entities, relationships and attributes.

Basic Concepts:
The E-R data model employs three basic notions : entity sets, relationship sets and attributes.

Entity Sets:

An entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects. For
example, each person in an enterprise is an entity. An entity has a set properties and the values for
some set of properties may uniquely identify an entity. BOOK is entity and its properties (called as
attributes) bookcode, booktitle, price etc.

An entity set is a set of entities of the same type that share the same properties, or attributes. The set
