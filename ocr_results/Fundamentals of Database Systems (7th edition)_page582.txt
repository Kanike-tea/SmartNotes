read/write head on the correct track. The time required to do this is called the seek
time. Typical seek times are 5 to 10 msec on desktops and 3 to 8 msec on servers.
Following that, there is another delay—called the rotational delay or latency—while
the beginning of the desired block rotates into position under the read/write head. It
depends on the rpm of the disk. For example, at 15,000 rpm, the time per rotation is
4 msec and the average rotational delay is the time per half revolution, or 2 msec. At
10,000 rpm the average rotational delay increases to 3 msec. Finally, some additional
time is needed to transfer the data; this is called the block transfer time. Hence, the
total time needed to locate and transfer an arbitrary block, given its address, is the
sum of the seek time, rotational delay, and block transfer time. The seek time and
rotational delay are usually much larger than the block transfer time. To make the
transfer of multiple blocks more efficient, it is common to transfer several consecu-
tive blocks on the same track or cylinder. This eliminates the seek time and rota-
tional delay for all but the first block and can result in a substantial saving of time
when numerous contiguous blocks are transferred. Usually, the disk manufacturer
provides a bulk transfer rate for calculating the time required to transfer consecu-
tive blocks. Appendix B contains a discussion of these and other disk parameters.

The time needed to locate and transfer a disk block is in the order of milliseconds,
usually ranging from 9 to 60 msec. For contiguous blocks, locating the first block
takes from 9 to 60 msec, but transferring subsequent blocks may take only 0.4
to 2 msec each. Many search techniques take advantage of consecutive retrieval of
blocks when searching for data on a disk. In any case, a transfer time in the order of
milliseconds is considered high compared with the time required to process data in
main memory by current CPUs. Hence, locating data on disk is a major bottleneck
in database applications. The file structures we discuss here and in Chapter 17
attempt to minimize the number of block transfers needed to locate and transfer the
required data from disk to main memory. Placing “related information” on contig-

uous blocks is the basic goal of any storage organization on disk.

16.2.2 Making Data Access More Efficient on Disk

In this subsection, we list some of the commonly used techniques to make accessing

data more efficient on HDDs.

1. Buffering of data: In order to deal with the incompatibility of speeds
between a CPU and the electromechanical device such as an HDD, which is
inherently slower, buffering of data is done in memory so that new data can
be held in a buffer while old data is processed by an application. We discuss
the double buffering strategy followed by general issues of buffer manage-

ment and buffer replacement strategies in Section 16.3.

2. Proper organization of data on disk: Given the structure and organization
of data on disk, it is advantageous to keep related data on contiguous blocks;
when multiple cylinders are needed by a relation, contiguous cylinders
should be used. Doing so avoids unnecessary movement of the read/write

arm and related seek times.
