Boolean Expression

A 2-to-1 multiplexer consists of two inputs I0 and I1, one select input S and one output Y. Depending
on the select signal, the output is connected to either of the inputs. Since there are two input signals,
only two ways are possible to connect the inputs to the outputs, so one select is needed to do these

operations.
