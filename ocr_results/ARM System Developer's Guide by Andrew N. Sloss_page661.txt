above.
E The ARM core supports the Enhanced DSP instruction additions to ARMVv5. The E is
automatic for ARMv6 and above.
F The ARM core supports hardware floating point via the Vector Floating Point (VFP)
architecture.
I ‘The ARM core supports hardware breakpoints and watchpoints via the EmbeddedICE cell.
The J is automatic for ARMv5 and above.
J The ARM core supports the Jazelle Java acceleration architecture.
M The ARM core supports the long multiply instructions for ARMv3. The M is automatic for
ARMy4 and above.
-S The ARM processor uses a synthesizable hardware design.
T The ARM core supports the Thumb instruction set for ARMv4 and above. The T is
automatic for ARMv6 and above.
