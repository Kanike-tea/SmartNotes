LOR load word into a register Rd <- mem32[address}

STR save byte or word from a register | Rd -> mem32/address}

LDRB | load byte into a register Rd <- mem8 {address}
STRB | save byte from a register Rd -> mem8 {address}
LDRH | load halfword into a register Rd <- mem16[address}
STRH | save halfword into a register Rd -> mem16[address}
LDRSB | load signed byte into a register Rd <- SignExtend

(mem8 address} )

LDRSH | load signed halfword into a register | Rd <- SignExtend

(mem16[address})

Example:;
; load register rO with the contents of the memory address pointed to by register
rl.

LDR 10, [rl] ; = LDR r0, [r1, #0]
; store the contents of register r0 to the memory address pointed to by register
rl.

STR 10, [rl]; =STR 0, [r1, #0]

LDR and STR instructions can load and store data on a boundary alignment that is the same
as the data type size being loaded or stored. For example, LDR can only load 32-bit words on
a memory address that is a multiple of four bytes—O, 4, 8, and so on. This example shows a
load from a memory address contained in register rl, followed by a store back to the same
address in memory.

The first instruction loads a word from the address stored in register rl and places it into
register r0. The second instruction goes the other way by storing the contents of register r0 to
the address contained in register rl. The offset from register rl is zero. Register rl is called

the base address register.

3.2 Single-Register Load-Store Addressing Modes
The ARM instruction set provides different modes for addressing memory. These modes

incorporate one of the indexing methods:
