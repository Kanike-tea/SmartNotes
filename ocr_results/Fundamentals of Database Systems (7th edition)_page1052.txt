Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search

27.1 Information Retrieval (IR) Concepts

Information retrieval is the process of retrieving documents from a collection in
response to a query (or a search request) by a user. This section provides an over-
view of IR concepts. In Section 27.1.1, we introduce information retrieval in general
and then discuss the different kinds and levels of search that IR encompasses. In
Section 27.1.2, we compare IR and database technologies. Section 27.1.3 gives a
brief history of IR. We then present the different modes of user interaction with IR
systems in Section 27.1.4. In Section 27.1.5, we describe the typical IR process with
a detailed set of tasks and then with a simplified process flow, and we end with a
brief discussion of digital libraries and the Web.

27.1.1 Introduction to Information Retrieval

We first review the distinction between structured and unstructured data (see Sec-
tion 13.1) to see how information retrieval differs from structured data manage-
ment. Consider a relation (or table) called HOUSES with the attributes:

HOUSES (Lot#, Address, Square_footage, Listed_price)

This is an example of structured data. We can compare this relation with home-
buying contract documents, which are examples of unstructured data. These types
of documents can vary from city to city, and even county to county, within a given
state in the United States. Typically, a contract document in a particular state will
have a standard list of clauses described in paragraphs within sections of the docu-
ment, with some predetermined (fixed) text and some variable areas whose content
is to be supplied by the specific buyer and seller. Other variable information would
include interest rate for financing, down-payment amount, closing dates, and so
on. The documents could also include pictures taken during a home inspection.
The information content in such documents can be considered unstructured data
that can be stored ina variety of possible arrangements and formats. By unstructured
information, we generally mean information that does not have a well-defined
formal model and corresponding formal language for representation and reason-
ing, but rather is based on understanding of natural language.

With the advent of the World Wide Web (or Web, for short), the volume of
unstructured information stored in messages and documents that contain textual
and multimedia information has exploded. These documents are stored in a variety
of standard formats, including HTML, XML (see Chapter 13), and several audio
and video formatting standards. Information retrieval deals with the problems of
storing, indexing, and retrieving (searching) such information to satisfy the needs
of users. The problems that IR deals with are exacerbated by the fact that the num-
ber of Web pages and the number of social interaction events is already in the bil-
lions and is growing at a phenomenal rate. All forms of unstructured data described
above are being added at the rates of millions per day, expanding the searchable
space on the Web at rapidly increasing rates.

Historically, information retrieval is “the discipline that deals with the structure,
analysis, organization, storage, searching, and retrieval of information” as defined
