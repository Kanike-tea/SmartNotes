Digital Design and Computer Organization(BCS302)

The n input binary variables come from an external source; the m output variables are
produced by the internal combinational logic circuit and go to an external destination.

Each input and output variable exists physically as an analog signal whose values are
interpreted to be a binary signal that represents logic 1 and logic 0.

+ If the registers are included with the combinational gates, then the total circuit must
be considered to be a sequential circuit.

+ Forn input variables, there are 2" possible combinations of the binary inputs.

+ For each possible input combination, there is one possible value for each output
variable. Thus, a combinational circuit can be specified with a truth table that lists the
output values for each combination of input variables.

Design procedure
The procedure to design combinational circiut involves the following steps:

1. From the specifications of the circuit, Determine the required number of inputs
and outputs and assign a symbol to each.

2. Derive the truth table that defines the required relationship between inputs and
outputs.

3. Obtain the simplified Boolean functions for each output as a function of the
input variables.

4. Draw the logic diagram and verify the correctness of the design (manually or by
simulation).

Example for design Procedure
Code Conversion (Convert BCD to Excess-3 Code)

+ A code converter is a circuit that makes the two systems compatible even though
each uses a different binary code.

+ Since each code uses four bits to represent a decimal digit, there must be four input
variables and four output variables. We designate the four input binary variables by
the symbols A, B, C, and D, and the four output variables by w, x,y , and z.

+ ADD 3 to BCD to get Excess -3 Code
