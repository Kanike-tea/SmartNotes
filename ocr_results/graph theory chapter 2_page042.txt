We note that G is the same as K3, Gy is the same as Ky and G, ciecauimmmnrtrt K2.
. using the multiplication theorem (Theorem 2), we obtain

——————
This is the chromatic polynomial for the given graph G.*
For A = 5, this polynomial gives

P(G,5) = 5x4x3? x2 = 360. sue

This means that if 5 colours are available, the vertices of the graph can be properly coloured
in 360 different ways. .
Use the Decomposition Theorem to find the chromatic polynomial for the graph
Pay in Figure2.51.
> Let us denote the given graph (shown in Figure 2.51) by G and the edge {v1, v2} by e. Then
the graphs G, and Gi, (as defined in the Decomposition Theorem) would be as shown in Figure
2.53.
