The heart's pumping action is controlled by electrical signaling, which generates the rhythm of
the heartbeat. This electrical signaling can be monitored using an electrocardiogram (ECG),
which records the electrical activity of the heart and provides important information about the
heart's function.
An ECG measures the electrical signals produced by the heart as it beats and generates a trace
or waveform that reflects the electrical activity of the heart. This trace can be used to diagnose
heart conditions and monitor the heart's function.
Some common heart-related issues that can be diagnosed or monitored using an ECG include:
e Arrhythmias: Abnormalities in the heart's rhythm or rate can be detected using an ECG.
e Heart disease: Changes in the heart's electrical activity can indicate the presence of
heart disease, such as coronary artery disease or heart attacks.
e Heart attack: An ECG can help diagnose a heart attack by detecting changes in the
heart's electrical activity that indicate a lack of blood flow to the heart.
Overall, the ECG is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring heart-related issues and helps
to provide important information about the heart's function and health.

Blockages in blood vessels, also known as arterial blockages or atherosclerosis, can occur for
several reasons:

O High cholesterol levels: Excessive amounts of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
in the blood can lead to the formation of plaque in the blood vessels, which can narrow or block
them.

O High blood pressure: Over time, high blood pressure can cause damage to the blood vessels,
leading to the formation of plaque and blockages.

O Smoking: Smoking can damage the inner walls of blood vessels and promote the build-up
of plaque, leading to blockages.
