Adjacency Multilists:

In the adjacency list representation of an undirected graph, we represent each edge, (vi, Vj), by
two entries. One entry is on the list for vj, and the other is on the list for Vj.

For each edge there is exactly one node, but this node is on the adjacency list for each of the
two vertices it is incident to the new node structure.

marked | vertex! | vertex2 | path | | path2

Node structure for adjacency multilists

typedef struct edge *edge-pointer;
typedef struct edge {
short int marked;
int vertexl;
int vertex2;
edge—pointer pathl;
edge-—pointer path2;
M3
edge-—pointer graph[MAX—VERTICES] ;
