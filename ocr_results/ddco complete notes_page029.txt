Introduction
* Logic circuits for digital systems may be combinational or sequential.

* A combinational circuit consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are
determined from only the present combination of inputs.

* A combinational circuit performs an operation that can be specified logically by a set
of Boolean functions.

* sequential circuits employ storage elements in addition to logic gates. Their outputs
are a function of the inputs and the state of the storage elements

* Because the state of the storage elements is a function of previous inputs, the outputs
of a sequential circuit depend not only on present values of inputs, but also on past
inputs, and the circuit behavior must be specified by a time sequence of inputs and
internal states.

combinational circuit
A combinational circuit consists of an interconnection of logic gates.

* Combinational logic gates react to the values of the signals at their inputs and
produce the value of the output signal, transforming binary information from the
given input data to a required output data.
