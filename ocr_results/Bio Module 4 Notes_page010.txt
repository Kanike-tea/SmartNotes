Light-Dependent Reactions:
Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments in the thylakoid membranes of
chloroplasts.

L

Water molecules (H2O) are split through a process called photolysis, releasing electrons,
protons (H*), and oxygen (O2).

L

The excited electrons from photolysis are captured by electron carriers, such as NADP*
(Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate) and converted to NADPH (Nicotinamide
Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate).

L

Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) combines with inorganic phosphate (Pi) to form adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). This process is known as phosphorylation and is a fundamental step in
cellular energy metabolism.

L

Oxygen molecules (O2) generated from the splitting of water are released as a byproduct into the
atmosphere.
