7. Limitations of Graph Databases
While powerful, graph databases also have some limitations:

« Not ideal for all use cases: Simple key-value data or high-volume transactional data
may be better served by other NoSQL types.

e Scalability challenges: Though improving, some graph databases (like Neo4j) scale
vertically better than horizontally.

e Learning curve: Query languages like Cypher or Gremlin require learning, especially
for users accustomed to SQL.

8. Summary

Graph databases offer a powerful way to model and query data with rich, complex
relationships. By focusing on connections, they outperform relational databases in many
real-world applications like social networks, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.
With tools like Neo4j and the Cypher query language, developers can write expressive
queries that reflect how people think about data — as interconnected information.

They represent a growing part of the NoSQL ecosystem, complementing key-value,
document, and column-based stores in building modern, scalable, and intelligent
applications.

Neo4j — A Leading Graph Database

Neo4j is the most widely used and mature graph database in the market. It uses a native
graph storage and processing engine, which means that its data model and internal
architecture are optimized for graph-based operations from the ground up. Neo4j
represents data using a property graph model, where both nodes and relationships can
