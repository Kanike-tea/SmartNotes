15.2 Properties of Relational Decompositions

15.2 Properties of Relational Decompositions

We now turn our attention to the process of decomposition that we used through-
out Chapter 14 to get rid of unwanted dependencies and achieve higher normal
forms. In Section 15.2.1, we give examples to show that looking at an individual
relation to test whether it is in a higher normal form does not, on its own, guarantee
a good design; rather, a set of relations that together form the relational database
schema must possess certain additional properties to ensure a good design. In Sec-
tions 15.2.2 and 15.2.3, we discuss two of these properties: the dependency preser-
vation property and the nonadditive (or lossless) join property. Section 15.
discusses binary decompositions, and Section 15.2.5 discusses successive nonaddi-
tive join decompositions.

15.2.1 Relation Decomposition and Insufficiency
of Normal Forms

The relational database design algorithms that we present in Section 15.3 start from
a single universal relation schema R = {Aj, A, ... , A,} that includes all the attri-
butes of the database. We implicitly make the universal relation assumption,
which states that every attribute name is unique. The set F of functional dependen-
cies that should hold on the attributes of R is specified by the database designers
and is made available to the design algorithms. Using the functional dependencies,
the algorithms decompose the universal relation schema R into a set of relation
schemas D = {R;, Ro, ... ; Rm} that will become the relational database schema; D is
called a decomposition of R.

We must make sure that each attribute in R will appear in at least one relation
schema R; in the decomposition so that no attributes are lost; formally, we have

Ur=R

This is called the attribute preservation condition of a decomposition.

Another goal is to have each individual relation R; in the decomposition D be in
BCNF or 3NF. However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee a good data-
base design on its own. We must consider the decomposition of the universal rela-
tion as a whole, in addition to looking at the individual relations. To illustrate this
point, consider the EMP_LOCS(Ename, Plocation) relation in Figure 14.5, which is in
3NF and also in BCNF. In fact, any relation schema with only two attributes is auto-
matically in BCNF.° Although EMP_LOCS is in BCNE, it still gives rise to spurious
tuples when joined with EMP_PROJ (Ssn, Pnumber, Hours, Pname, Plocation), which is
not in BCNF (see the partial result of the natural join in Figure 14.6). Hence,
EMP_LOCS represents a particularly bad relation schema because of its convoluted

®As an exercise, the reader should prove that this statement is true.
