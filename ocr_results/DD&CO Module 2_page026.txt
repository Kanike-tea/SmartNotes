A change in state of the flip-flops is initiated only by a clock pulse transition—for example, when the
value of the clock signals changes from 0 to 1. Thus, the transition from one state to the next occurs only
at predetermined intervals dictated by the clock pulses.

Storage Elements: Latches

A storage element in a digital circuit can maintain a binary state indefinitely (as long as power is
delivered to the circuit), until directed by an input signal to switch states. The major differences among
various types of storage elements are in the number of inputs they possess and in the manner in which
the inputs affect the binary state. Storage elements that operate with signal levels (rather than signal
transitions) are referred to as latches; those controlled by a clock transition are flip-flops. Latches are
said to be level sensitive devices; flip-flops are edge-sensitive devices. The two types of storage elements
are related because latches are the basic circuits from which all flip-flops are constructed.

SR Latch

The SR latch is a circuit with two cross-coupled NOR gates or two cross-coupled NAND gates, and two
inputs labeled S for set and R for reset. The SR latch constructed with two cross-coupled NOR gates is
shown in Fig(a). The latch has two useful states. When output Q = | and Q'= 0, the latch is said to be in
the set state. When Q = 0 and Q'= 1, it is in the reset state. Outputs Q and Q' are normally the complement
of each other. However, when both inputs are equal to | at the same time, a condition in which both
outputs are equal to 0 (rather than be mutually complementary) occurs. If both inputs are then switched
to 0 simultaneously, the device will enter an unpredictable or undefined state or a metastable state.

SR latch with NOR gates

As shown in the function table of above Fig(b), two input conditions cause the circuit to be in the set
state. The first condition (S = 1, R = 0) is the action that must be taken by input S to bring the circuit to
the set state. Removing the active input from S leaves the circuit in the same state. After both inputs
return to 0, it is then possible to shift to the reset state by momentary applying a | to the R input. The |
can then be removed from R, whereupon the circuit remains in the reset state. Thus, when both inputs S
and R are equal to 0, the latch can be in either the set or the reset state, depending on which input was
most recently a 1.

If a 1 is applied to both the S and R inputs of the latch, both outputs go to 0. This action produces an
undefined next state, because the state that results from the input transitions depends on the order in
which they return to 0. It also violates the requirement that outputs be the complement of each other. In
normal operation, this condition is avoided by making sure that 1’s are not applied to both inputs
simultaneously.

The SR latch with two cross-coupled NAND gates is shown in below Fig. It operates with both inputs
normally at 1, unless the state of the latch has to be changed. The application of 0 to the S input causes
output Q to go to 1, putting the latch in the set state. When the S input goes back to 1, the circuit remains
