Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

1.3 Characteristics of the Database Approach

A number of characteristics distinguish the database approach from the much
older approach of writing customized programs to access data stored in files. In
traditional file processing, each user defines and implements the files needed for a
specific software application as part of programming the application. For example,
one user, the grade reporting office, may keep files on students and their grades.
Programs to print a student’s transcript and to enter new grades are implemented
as part of the application. A second user, the accounting office, may keep track of
students’ fees and their payments. Although both users are interested in data about
students, each user maintains separate files—and programs to manipulate these
files—because each requires some data not available from the other user’s files.
This redundancy in defining and storing data results in wasted storage space and
in redundant efforts to maintain common up-to-date data.

In the database approach, a single repository maintains data that is defined once
and then accessed by various users repeatedly through queries, transactions, and
application programs. The main characteristics of the database approach versus the
file-processing approach are the following:

Self-describing nature of a database system
Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction

.
.
= Support of multiple views of the data
.

Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing

We describe each of these characteristics in a separate section. We will discuss addi-
tional characteristics of database systems in Sections 1.6 through 1.8.

1.3.1 Self-Describing Nature of a Database System

A fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that the database system
contains not only the database itself but also a complete definition or description of
the database structure and constraints. This definition is stored in the DBMS cata-
log, which contains information such as the structure of each file, the type and stor-
age format of each data item, and various constraints on the data. The information
stored in the catalog is called meta-data, and it describes the structure of the pri-
mary database (Figure 1.1). It is important to note that some newer types of data-
base systems, known as NOSQL systems, do not require meta-data. Rather the data
is stored as self-describing data that includes the data item names and data values
together in one structure (see Chapter 24).

The catalog is used by the DBMS software and also by database users who need
information about the database structure. A general-purpose DBMS software
package is not written for a specific database application. Therefore, it must refer
to the catalog to know the structure of the files in a specific database, such as the
type and format of data it will access. The DBMS software must work equally well
with any number of database applications—for example, a university database, a
