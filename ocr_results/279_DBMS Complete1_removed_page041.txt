Hashed file organization:
Hashing is the most common form of purely random access to a file or database. It is also used to
access columns that do not have a index as an optimization technique. Hash functions calculate the
address of the page in which the record is to be stored based on one or more fields in the record.
The records in a hash file appear randomly distributed across the available space. It requires some
hashing algorithm and the technique. Hashing algorithm converts a primary key value into a record
address.
Advantage of hashed file organization:

1. Insertion or search on hash key is fast.

2. Best if equality search is needed on hash key
Disadvantage of hashed file organization:
It is a complex file organization method
search is slow
It suffers from disk space overhead
Unbalanced buckets degrade performance
Range search is slow
