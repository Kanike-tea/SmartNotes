Advantages

It can last decades or centuries. This is the biggest advantage of self-healing concrete.
This ensures that we shall never have to replace your concrete surface again during its
lifespan.

Self -healing concrete decreases concrete maintenance. In normal concrete, you have
to fill and seal the cracks. But you do not have to do or worry about this with self-
healing concrete

Improved in compressive strength of concrete.

Dis-Advantages

One of the biggest disadvantages currently of it is cost. It is expensive compared to
normal concrete. Maybe in future, the cost will reduce when self -healing concrete
will become common. Now it is quite rare.

Not many contractors know how to use this product yet. Because it is a new product
many people do not have an idea of using it.

There is no code available to standardize the self-healing concrete

12. Explain briefly a. Bio Remediation b. Bio-Mining.

Answer:

Bioremediation is a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms to
neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site.

Bio-mining is use of organisms to promote the LEACHING (solubilization) of metals from
their ores or use of organisms, such as BACTERIA and PLANTS, to accumulate metals from
