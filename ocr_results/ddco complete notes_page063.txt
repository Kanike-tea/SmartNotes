When J = 1 and K = 0, D = Q’ + Q= 1, so the next clock edge sets the output to 1.

When J = 0 and K = 1, D = 0, so the next clock edge resets the output to 0.

When both J = K = 1 and D = Q, the next clock edge complements the output.

When both J = K = 0 and D = Q, the clock edge leaves the output unchanged.
