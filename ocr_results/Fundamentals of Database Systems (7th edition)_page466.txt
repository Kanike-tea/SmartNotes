Chapter 13. XML: Extensible Markup Language

the same file system as the XML document and should be given the file name
proj.dtd. Alternatively, we could include the DTD document text at the beginning of
the XML document itself to allow the checking.

Figure 13.4(b) shows another DTD document called Company to illustrate the use
of IDREF. A Company document can have any number of Department, Employee,
and Project elements, with IDs DeptID, Empld, and ProjID, respectively. The
Employee element has an attribute DeptId of type IDREF, which is a reference to
the Department element where the employee works; this is similar to a foreign key.
The Project element has an attribute Workers of type IDREFS, which will hold a list
of Employee EmpIDs that work on that project; this is similar to a collection or list
of foreign keys. The #IMPLIED keyword means that this attribute is optional. It is
also possible to provide a default value for any attribute.

Although XML DTD is adequate for specifying tree structures with required,
optional, and repeating elements, and with various types of attributes, it has several
limitations. First, the data types in DTD are not very general. Second, DTD has its
own special syntax and thus requires specialized processors. It would be advanta-
geous to specify XML schema documents using the syntax rules of XML itself so
that the same processors used for XML documents could process XML schema
descriptions. Third, all DTD elements are always forced to follow the specified
ordering of the document, so unordered elements are not permitted. These draw-
backs led to the development of XML schema, a more general but also more com-
plex language for specifying the structure and elements of XML documents.

13.3.2 XML Schema

The XML schema language is a standard for specifying the structure of XML docu-
ments. It uses the same syntax rules as regular XML documents, so that the same pro-
cessors can be used on both. To distinguish the two types of documents, we will use the
term XML instance document or XML document for a regular XML document that con-
tains both tag names and data values, and XML schema document for a document that
specifies an XML schema. An XML schema document would contain only tag names,
tree structure information, constraints, and other descriptions but no data values. Fig-
ure 13.5 shows an XML schema document corresponding to the COMPANY database
shown in Figure 5.5. Although it is unlikely that we would want to display the whole
database as a single document, there have been proposals to store data in native XML
format as an alternative to storing the data in relational databases. The schema in Fig-
ure 13.5 would serve the purpose of specifying the structure of the COMPANY database
if it were stored in a native XML system. We discuss this topic further in Section 13.4.

As with XML DTD, XML schema is based on the tree data model, with elements and
attributes as the main structuring concepts. However, it borrows additional concepts
from database and object models, such as keys, references, and identifiers. Here we
describe the features of XML schema in a step-by-step manner, referring to the sam-
ple XML schema document in Figure 13.5 for illustration. We introduce and describe
some of the schema concepts in the order in which they are used in Figure 13.5.
