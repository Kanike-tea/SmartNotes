e Examples of such constraints are the salary of an employee should not exceed the

salary of the employee’s supervisor and the maximum number of hours an employee

can work on all projects per week is 56.

1.2.1 Domain Constraints
Domain Constraints specify that within each tuple, the value of each attribute A must be
an atomic value from the domain dom(A). The data types associated with domains
typically include standard numeric data types for integers (such as short integer, integer,
and long integer) and real numbers (float and doubleprecision float). Characters,
Booleans, fixed-length strings, and variable-length strings are also available, as are date,

time, timestamp, and money, or other special data types.

1.2.2 Key Constraints and Constraints on NULL Values
All tuples in a relation must also be distinct. This means that no two tuples can have the
same combination of values for ai/ their attributes. There are other subsets of attributes of
a relation schema R with the property that no two tuples in any relation state r of R should
have the same combination of values for these attributes.
Suppose that we denote one such subset of attributes by SK; then for any two distinct
tuples tl and 2 in a relation state r of R, we have the constraint that: t[SK]# #[SK] .

such set of attributes SK is called a superkey of the relation schema R

superkey
A superkey SK specifies a uniqueness constraint that no two distinct tuples in any state r of

R can have the same value for SK. Every relation has at least one default superkey—the set

of all its attributes.

Key
A key K of a relation schema R is a superkey of R with the additional property that

removing any attribute 4 from K leaves a set of attributes K’ that is not a superkey of R

anymore. Hence, a key satisfies two properties:

1. Two distinct tuples in any state of the relation cannot have identical values for (all) the

attributes in the key. This first property also applies to a superkey.
