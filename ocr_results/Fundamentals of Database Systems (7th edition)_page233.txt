How do the relations (tables) in SQL differ from the relations defined for-
mally in Chapter 3? Discuss the other differences in terminology. Why does
SQL allow duplicate tuples in a table or in a query result?

List the data types that are allowed for SQL attributes.

How does SQL allow implementation of the entity integrity and referential
integrity constraints described in Chapter 3? What about referential trig-
gered actions?

Consider the database shown in Figure 1.2, whose schema is shown in Fig-
ure 2.1. What are the referential integrity constraints that should hold on the
schema? Write appropriate SQL DDL statements to define the database.

Repeat Exercise 6.5, but use the AIRLINE database schema of Figure 5.8.

Consider the LIBRARY relational database schema shown in Figure 6.6.
Choose the appropriate action (reject, cascade, set to NULL, set to default) for
each referential integrity constraint, both for the deletion of a referenced
tuple and for the update of a primary key attribute value in a referenced
tuple. Justify your choices.

Write appropriate SQL DDL statements for declaring the LIBRARY relational
database schema of Figure 6.6. Specify the keys and referential triggered
actions.

How can the key and foreign key constraints be enforced by the DBMS? Is
the enforcement technique you suggest difficult to implement? Can the con-
straint checks be executed efficiently when updates are applied to the data-
base?

. Specify the following queries in SQL on the COMPANY relational database

schema shown in Figure 5.5. Show the result of each query if it is applied to

the COMPANY database in Figure 5.6.

a. Retrieve the names of all employees in department 5 who work more
than 10 hours per week on the ProductX project.

b. List the names of all employees who have a dependent with the same first
