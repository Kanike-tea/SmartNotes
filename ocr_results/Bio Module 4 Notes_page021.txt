4.3.2 Aircraft Technology

Aircraft technology has advanced significantly since the first powered flight by the
Wright brothers in 1903. Here are some key components of modern aircraft technology:

e Aerodynamics: Modern aircraft are designed to be more aerodynamic, with wing shapes
optimized for lift and efficiency. Advanced materials and manufacturing techniques have
also been developed to reduce weight and improve durability.

e Jet engines: Jet engines, which use the principles of Newton's third law of motion to
produce thrust, have replaced propeller engines in most modern aircraft. These engines are
more powerful, fuel-efficient, and reliable.

e Avionics: Avionics, or aviation electronics, have advanced significantly with the
development of digital technology. Flight instruments, navigation systems, and
communication systems have become more precise, reliable, and sophisticated.

e Safety systems: Aircraft safety systems have been developed to reduce the risk of accidents
and improve passenger safety. These include systems for collision avoidance, weather
detection, and emergency response.

Automation: Aircraft automation has increased significantly in recent years, with the development of
advanced autopilot systems and computerized flight control systems. This technology has made
flying safer and more efficient, but has

e also raised concerns about pilot training and the potential for overreliance on automation.
Bio Mimicking Birds Fly for Aircraft Technology

Biomimicry, or the practice of using designs and processes found in nature to solve
human problems, has led to the development of various technologies inspired by birds' flight.
Some examples include:

e Wing design: The shape of bird wings has inspired the design of aircraft wings, which
have evolved to be more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient as a result. The study of bird
flight has also led to the development of winglets, small structures at the tip of wings
that reduce drag and increase lift.
