This is the probability distribution after 3 days. Sas eed

pO) = pf p3 = [2, 7a ee ra] =[7724, 17/24 |

That is, probability of travelling by train after 3 days = 7/24.
probability of travelling by bus after3days = 17/24

Referring to Problem-56, we have P° =| 1/4 1/2 1/4
1/8 3/8 1/2

Supposing that C was the person having the ball first then pi) = (0,0; 1)

Consider p>) = p( P® =[0,0,1]] 1/4 1/72 1/4
1/8 3/8 1/2} ;
p>) =[ 14, 3/8, v2] = [ri o>, p | :

This implies that after 5 throws the probability that the ball is with A is 1/8, the ball
with B is 3/8, the ball with C is 1/2. .
¢ Stationary distribution of regular Markov chains

A Markov chain is said to be regular if the associated transition probability matrix P
is regular. :

If P isa regular ——— matrix of the Markov chain, then the sequence of n step

transition matrices P?, P?, --P" approaches the matrix V whose Tows are each | -
the unique fixed probability rons v of P.

Wehave p\") = p) p" where, p!") = [r” P|

Further as 1 — ©, pS") = v, where i= 1, 2,3, -++m.
