1.1.3 Relational Model Notation

= Relation schema R of degree n is denoted by by R(A1, Ag, ...,An)

= Uppercase letters Q, R, S denote relation names

= Lowercase letters q, r, s denote relation states

= Letters t, u, v denote tuples

= In general, the name of a relation schema such as STUDENT also indicates the current set of
tuples in that relation

= An attribute A can be qualified with the relation name R to which it belongs by using the dot
notation R.A—for example, STUDENT.Name or STUDENT.Age.

= An n-tuple ¢ in a relation r(R) is denoted by ¢ = <v1, v2, .«, ve>, where vw is the value
corresponding to attribute 4;. The following notation refers to component yalues of tuples:

= Both ¢[Ai] and t.4; (and sometimes ¢[7]) refer to the value v; in ¢ for attribute A;.

= Both ¢[Au, Aw, ..., Az] and t.(du, Aw, ..., Az), Where Au, Aw, ..., Az is a list of attributes from R,
refer to the subtuple of values <vz, Vw, ..., v-> from ¢ corresponding to the attributes specified

in the list.

1.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas

Constraints are restrictions on thélactiial'valuesiin @ database state. These constraints are
GGrIVER OM TE ULES in the miniworldithat theldatabaselrepresents. Constraints on databases
can generally be divided into three main categories:

1. Inherent model-based constraints or implicit constraints

e Constraints that are inherent in the data model.

e The characteristics of relations are the inherent constraints of the relational model and
belong to the first category. For example, the constraint that a relation cannot have
duplicate tuples is an inherent constraint.

2. Schema-based constraints or explicit constraints
e Constraints that can be directly expressed in schemas of the data model, typically
by specifying them in the DDL.
e The schema-based constraints include domain constraints, key constraints, constraints
on NULLs, entity integrity constraints, and referential integrity constraints.
3. Application-based or semantic constraints or business rules
e Constraints that cannot be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model, and

hence must be expressed and enforced by the application programs.
