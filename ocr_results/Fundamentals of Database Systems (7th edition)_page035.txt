1.1 Introduction

constitute a database. However, the common use of the term database is usually
more restricted. A database has the following implicit properties:

= A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the
miniworld or the universe of discourse (UoD). Changes to the miniworld
are reflected in the database.

= A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent
meaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a
database.

= A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose.
It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in
which these users are interested.

In other words, a database has some source from which data is derived, some degree
of interaction with events in the real world, and an audience that is actively inter-
ested in its contents. The end users of a database may perform business transactions
(for example, a customer buys a camera) or events may happen (for example, an
employee has a baby) that cause the information in the database to change. In order
for a database to be accurate and reliable at all times, it must be a true reflection of
the miniworld that it represents; therefore, changes must be reflected in the data-
base as soon as possible.

A database can be of any size and complexity. For example, the list of names and
addresses referred to earlier may consist of only a few hundred records, each with a
simple structure. On the other hand, the computerized catalog of a large library
may contain half a million entries organized under different categories—by pri-
mary author’s last name, by subject, by book title—with each category organized
alphabetically. A database of even greater size and complexity would be maintained
by a social media company such as Facebook, which has more than a billion users.
The database has to maintain information on which users are related to one another
as friends, the postings of each user, which users are allowed to see each posting,
and a vast amount of other types of information needed for the correct operation of
their Web site. For such Web sites, a large number of databases are needed to keep
track of the constantly changing information required by the social media Web site.

An example of a large commercial database is Amazon.com. It contains data for
over 60 million active users, and millions of books, CDs, videos, DVDs, games,
electronics, apparel, and other items. The database occupies over 42 terabytes
(a terabyte is 10'* bytes worth of storage) and is stored on hundreds of computers
(called servers). Millions of visitors access Amazon.com each day and use the
database to make purchases. The database is continually updated as new books
and other items are added to the inventory, and stock quantities are updated as
purchases are transacted.

A database may be generated and maintained manually or it may be computer-
ized. For example, a library card catalog is a database that may be created and
maintained manually. A computerized database may be created and maintained
either by a group of application programs written specifically for that task or by a
