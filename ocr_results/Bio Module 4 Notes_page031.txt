loops. When pressed together, the hooks latch onto the loops, creating a strong bond that can be
easily detached by pulling the two strips apart. Velcro has a wide range of applications, including
in clothing, shoes, bags, and medical devices. It has become a popular alternative to traditional
fasteners, such as buttons and zippers, due to its ease of use and versatility.

The name "Velcro" is actually a combination of the words "velvet" and "crochet," as the
fabric strips resemble velvet and are hooked together like crochet. Velcro has since become a
popular alternative to traditional fasteners, such as buttons and zippers, due to its ease of use and
versatility.

Materials Used in Velcro Technology
Velcro technology uses two main materials: nylon and polyester .

1. The nylon is extruded to create tiny hooks that are then cut and shaped into the familiar
hook shape. These hooks are designed to latch onto the loop side of the Velcro.

The loop side of Velcro is made of polyester. Polyester is a synthetic fabric that is strong
and durable. The polyester is woven into a fabric that has many tiny loops. When the loops are
pressed against the hook side of the Velcro, the hooks latch onto the loops, creating a secure
attachment.

In addition to nylon and polyester, the adhesive used to attach the Velcro to surfaces can also vary.
Some types of Velcro use a pressure-sensitive adhesive that can be easily removed without leaving
a residue, while others use a stronger adhesive that creates a more permanent bond.
