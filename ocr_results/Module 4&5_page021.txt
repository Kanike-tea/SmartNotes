Communication—configuration is over serial or Ethernet. For serial, X-Modem protocol is used
to communicate with the GNU Debugger (GDB). For Ethernet, TCP is used to communicate

with GDB. RedBoot supports a range of network standards, such as bootp, telnet, and tftp.

Flash ROM memory management—provides a set of filing system routines that can download,
update, and erase images in flash ROM. In addition, the images can either be compressed or

uncompressed.

Full operating system support—supports the loading and booting of Embedded Linux, Red Hat
eCos, and many other popular operating systems. For Embedded Linux, RedBoot supports the

ability to define parameters that are passed directly to the kernel upon booting.
3.4 Example: Sandstone
It carries out only the following tasks:

e Set up target platform environment
¢ Load a bootable image into memory

¢  Relinquish control to an operating system.

Sandstone is a static design and cannot be configured after the build process is complete. Table

lists the basic characteristics of Sandstone.

Sandstone Directory Layout

The directory layout shows you where the source code is located and where the different build
files are placed. The directory structure is as shown in Figure 10.1. The structure follows a

standard style. The sandstone source file sand.s is located under the sand/build/sre directory.
