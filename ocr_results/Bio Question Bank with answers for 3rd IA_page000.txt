1. Explain the working & application of Bionic leaf technology.

Ans. A bionic leaf is a system that uses artificial photosynthesis to convert sunlight into usable
forms of energy, such as hydrogen or other biofuels. The bionic leaf is designed to mimic the
process of photosynthesis in plants, where light energy is used to split water molecules into
hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydrogen can then be used as a source of energy.

The bionic leaf consists of a photovoltaic cell that captures sunlight and converts it into
electrical energy, and a catalyst, such as a bacteria, that uses the electrical energy to split water
molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen produced by the bionic leaf can then be
stored and used as a source of energy for a variety of applications, such as powering vehicles
or generating electricity.

Working principle

The working principle of a bionic leaf is based on artificial photosynthesis, which aims to
mimic the process of photosynthesis in plants. The bionic leaf typically consists of a
photovoltaic cell that captures sunlight and converts it into electrical energy, and a catalyst,
such as a bacterium, that uses the electrical energy to split water molecules into hydrogen and
oxygen.

The photovoltaic cell is used to convert sunlight into electrical energy, which is then passed to
the catalyst. The catalyst, in turn, uses the electrical energy to power the process of water
splitting, where water molecules are separated into hydrogen and oxygen. This process is
facilitated by the presence of enzymes or other catalysts that act as a bridge between the
electrical energy and the water splitting reaction.

The hydrogen produced by the bionic leaf can then be stored and used as a source of energy
for a variety of applications, such as powering vehicles or generating electricity. Additionally,
the oxygen produced by the bionic leaf can be released into the atmosphere, where it can help
to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

A flow chart of the working principle of bionic leaf is given below:
