27.1 Information Retrieval (IR) Concepts

distributed content on the Web. This has spurred the rapid growth in search engine
technology, where search engines are trying to discover different kinds of real-time
content found on the Web. The part of a search engine responsible for discovering,
analyzing, and indexing these new documents is known as a crawler. Other types of
search engines exist for specific domains of knowledge. For example, the biomedical
literature search database was started in the 1970s and is now supported by the
PubMed search engine,” which gives access to over 24 million abstracts.

Although continuous progress is being made to tailor search results to the needs of
an end user, the challenge remains in providing high-quality, pertinent, and timely
information that is precisely aligned to the information needs of individual users.

27.1.4 Modes of Interaction in IR Systems

In the beginning of Section 27.1, we defined information retrieval as the process of
retrieving documents from a collection in response to a query (or a search request)
by a user. Typically the collection is made up of documents containing unstruc-
tured data. Other kinds of documents include images, audio recordings, video
strips, and maps. Data may be scattered nonuniformly in these documents with no
definitive structure. A query is a set of terms (also referred to as keywords) used by
the searcher to specify an information need (for example, the terms databases and
operating systems may be regarded as a query to a computer science bibliographic
database). An informational request or a search query may also be a natural lan-
guage phrase or a question (for example, “What is the currency of China?” or “Find
Italian restaurants in Sarasota, Florida.”).

There are two main modes of interaction with IR systems—retrieval and brows-
ing—which, although similar in goal, are accomplished through different interac-
tion tasks. Retrieval is concerned with the extraction of relevant information from
a repository of documents through an IR query, whereas browsing signifies the
exploratory activity of a user visiting or navigating through similar or related docu-
ments based on the user’s assessment of relevance. During browsing, a user’s infor-
mation need may not be defined a priori and is flexible. Consider the following
browsing scenario: A user specifies ‘Atlanta’ as a keyword. The information retrieval
system retrieves links to relevant result documents containing various aspects of
Atlanta for the user. The user comes across the term ‘Georgia Tech’ in one of the
returned documents and uses some access technique (such as clicking on the phrase
‘Georgia Tech’ in a document that has a built-in link) and visits documents about
Georgia Tech in the same or a different Web site (repository). There the user finds
an entry for ‘Athletics’ that leads the user to information about various athletic pro-
grams at Georgia Tech. Eventually, the user ends his search at the Fall schedule for
the Yellow Jackets football team, which he finds to be of great interest. This user
activity is known as browsing. Hyperlinks are used to interconnect Web pages and
are mainly used for browsing. Anchor texts are text phrases within documents used
to label hyperlinks and are very relevant to browsing.
