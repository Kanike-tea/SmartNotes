3.Set Associative Mapping:

e Itis the combination of direct and associative mapping techniques.

e The blocks of cache are divided into several groups. Such a groups are called as
sets.

e Each set consists of number of cache blocks. A memory block is loaded into one
of the cache sets.

e The main memory address consists of three fields, as shown in the figure.
e The lower 4 bits of memory address are used to select a word from a 16
words.

e Acache consists of 64 sets as shown in the figure. Hence 6 bit set field is used
to select a cache set from 64 sets.

e As there are 64 sets, the memory is divided into groups containing 64 blocks,
where each group is given a tag number.

e The most significant 6 bits of memory address is compared with the tag
fields of each set to determine whether memory block is available or not.

e The following figure clearly describes the working principle of Set
Associative Mapping technique.

cache that has “k” blocks per set is called as “k-way set associative cache".
Each block contains a control-bit called a valid-bit.

The Valid-bit indicates that whether the block contains valid-data (updated data).

The dirty bit indicates that whether the block has been modified during its cache
residency.

Valid-bit=O - When power is initially applied to system.

Valid-bit=1 - When the block is loaded from main-memory at first time.
- If the main-memory-block is updated by a source & if the block in the source
is already exists in the cache, then the valid-bit will be cleared to “O™.
- If Processor & DMA uses the same copies of data then it is called as Cache

Coherence Problem.
