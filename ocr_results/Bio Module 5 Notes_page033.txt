Technology behind the Electrical Tongue

The technology behind the electrical tongue involves the measurement of electrical
properties of a food or beverage sample. The electrical tongue typically consists of a sensor
array, which is placed in contact with the food or beverage sample.

Sensor Array used in Electronic Tongue Applications

A sensor array in the electrical tongue refers to a collection of multiple sensors that are
designed to detect and measure different taste qualities. These sensors are often specific to
particular taste components and provide information about the presence and intensity of specific
taste attributes. Here are some examples of sensor types used in an electrical tongue:

Potentiometric Ion-Selective Electrodes:

These sensors measure the concentration of specific ions associated with taste. For example, a
sodium-selective electrode can detect the salty taste by measuring the concentration of sodium ions
in a sample.

Voltammetric Sensors:

‘Voltammetric sensors measure changes in electrical current resulting from the oxidation
or reduction of specific chemical compounds. These sensors can be used to detect and quantify
various taste components. For example, a sensor designed to detect bitter taste may measure the
oxidation current produced by bitter compounds interacting with the sensor surface.

Impedance Sensors:

Impedance-based sensors measure changes in electrical impedance caused by the
interaction of taste compounds with the sensor surface. Different taste qualities can be detected
by monitoring impedance changes associated with specific interactions. For example, an
impedance sensor may detect changes in impedance caused by the adsorption of sweet
compounds on its surface.

Optical Sensors:

Optical sensors can be used to measure changes in light absorbance or fluorescence
caused by specific taste compounds. These sensors can provide information about the presence
and concentration of taste components. For instance, an optical sensor may measure changes in
fluorescence intensity resulting from the binding of a sour compound to a fluorescent indicator.

Conductometric Sensors:

Conductometric sensors detect changes in electrical conductivity resulting from the
interaction of taste compounds with the sensor surface. These sensors can be used to detect and
quantify different taste attributes. For example, a conductometric sensor may measure changes in
conductivity caused by the binding of umami compounds to its surface.

Mass-Sensitive Sensors:

Mass-sensitive sensors measure changes in mass or resonance frequency caused by the
adsorption of taste compounds. These sensors can provide information about the presence and
