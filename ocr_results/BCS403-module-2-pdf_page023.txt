The CARTESIAN PRODUCT creates tuples with the combined attributes of two relations. We

can SELECT related tuples only from the two relations by specifying an appropriate selection

condition after the Cartesian product.
In SQL, CARTESIAN PRODUCT can be realized by using the CROSS JOIN option in joined

tables

2.4 Binary Relational Operations: JOIN and DIVISION
2.4.1 The JOIN Operation

The JOIN operation, denoted by ><}, is used to combine related tuples from two relations into

single “longer” tuples.It allows us to process relationships among relations. The general form of a

JOIN operation on two relations R(A1, 42, ..., An) and S(Bi, Bo, ..., Bm) is
RA, Goin eonditionS

Example: Retrieve the name of the manager of each department.
To get the manager’s name, we need to combine each department tuple with the employee tuple

whose Ssn value matches the Mgr_ssn value in the department tuple
