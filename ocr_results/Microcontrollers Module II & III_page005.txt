N shift operations Syntax

Immediate #immediate

Register Rm

Logical shift left by immediate Rm, LSL #shift_imm
Logical shift left by register Rm, LSL Rs

Logical shift right by immediate Rm, LSR #shift_imm
Logical shift right with register Rm, LSR Rs
Arithmetic shift right by immediate Rm, ASR #shift_imm
Arithmetic shift right by register Rm, ASR Rs

Rotate right by immediate Rm, ROR #shift_imm
Rotate right by register Rm, ROR Rs

Rotate right with extend Rm, RRX

Example:

MOVS r0,r1, LSL #1 ; rl register content left shifted by one position and copied to r0 and
CPSR register get updated because of suffix S.

PRE cpsr = nzcvqiFt_USER, r0 = 0x00000000, rl = 0x80000004
POST epsr = nzCvqiFt_USER, r0 = 0x00000008, r1 = 0x80000004

This example of a MOVS instruction shifts register r1 left by one bit. This multiplies register
rl by a value 2. C flag is updated in the cpsr because the S suffix is present in the instruction

mnemonic.

Table 3 lists the syntax for the different barrel shift operations available on data processing
instructions. The second operand N can be an immediate constant preceded by #, a register

value Rm, or the value of Rm processed by a shift.
2.3 Arithmetic Instructions

The arithmetic instructions implement addition and subtraction of 32-bit signed and unsigned

values.

Syntax: <instruction>{<cond>}{S} Rd, Rn, N
