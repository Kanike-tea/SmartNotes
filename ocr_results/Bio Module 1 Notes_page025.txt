2. Properties of Hormones

1. Chemical Nature — Hormones can be proteins, peptides, steroids, or amines.

Specificity — Each hormone affects only specific target cells with corresponding

Low Concentration, High Effect - Hormones are effective in minute quantities.

Regulation by Feedback Mechanism — Hormone secretion is often controlled by

. Transport in Blood —Some hormones are water-soluble (e.g., peptide hormones) and

travel freely in blood, while lipid-soluble hormones (e.g., steroid hormones) require

receptors.
3.
4.
negative feedback (e.g., insulin & glucose levels).
5
carrier proteins.
6.

Short or Long-Term Effects — Some hormones act quickly (e.g., adrenaline), while

others have long-term effects (e.g., growth hormone).
