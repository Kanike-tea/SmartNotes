Given a File of N employee records with a set K of Keys (4-digit) which uniquely
determine the records in file F. Assume that file F is maintained in memory by a Hash
Table (HT) of m memory locations with L as the set of memory addresses (2-digit) of
locations in HT. Let the keys in K and addresses in L are Integers. Develop a Program in C
that uses Hash function H:

K —L as H(K)=K mod m (remainder method), and implement hashing

technique to map a given key K to the address space L. Resolve the collision (if any) using
linear probing.
