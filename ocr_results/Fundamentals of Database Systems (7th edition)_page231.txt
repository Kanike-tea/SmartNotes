6.5 Additional Features of SQL

constraints of the DDL (see Section 6.2.2). An additional SET clause in the
UPDATE command specifies the attributes to be modified and their new values.
For example, to change the location and controlling department number of proj-
ect number 10 to ‘Bellaire’ and 5, respectively, we use U5:

US: UPDATE PROJECT
SET Plocation = ‘Bellaire’, Dnum = 5
WHERE Pnumber = 10;

Several tuples can be modified with a single UPDATE command. An example is to
give all employees in the ‘Research’ department a 10% raise in salary, as shown in
U6. In this request, the modified Salary value depends on the original Salary value
in each tuple, so two references to the Salary attribute are needed. In the SET
clause, the reference to the Salary attribute on the right refers to the old Salary
value before modification, and the one on the left refers to the new Salary value
after modification:

U6: UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
WHERE Dno =5;

It is also possible to specify NULL or DEFAULT as the new attribute value. Notice that
each UPDATE command explicitly refers to a single relation only. To modify multi-
ple relations, we must issue several UPDATE commands.

6.5 Additional Features of SQL

SQL has a number of additional features that we have not described in this chapter
but that we discuss elsewhere in the book. These are as follows:

= In Chapter 7, which is a continuation of this chapter, we will present the fol-
lowing SQL features: various techniques for specifying complex retrieval
queries, including nested queries, aggregate functions, grouping, joined
tables, outer joins, case statements, and recursive queries; SQL views, trig-
gers, and assertions; and commands for schema modification.

= SQL has various techniques for writing programs in various programming
languages that include SQL statements to access one or more databases.
These include embedded (and dynamic) SQL, SQL/CLI (Call Level Interface)
and its predecessor ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity), and SQL/PSM
(Persistent Stored Modules). We discuss these techniques in Chapter 10. We
also describe how to access SQL databases through the Java programming
language using JDBC and SQL].

= Each commercial RDBMS will have, in addition to the SQL commands, a set
of commands for specifying physical database design parameters, file struc-
tures for relations, and access paths such as indexes. We called these com-
mands a storage definition language (SDL) in Chapter 2. Earlier versions of
SQL had commands for creating indexes, but these were removed from the
