Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP

DOCNAME can be any string as long as it used both to start and end the here
document. This is illustrated in lines 8 through 11 in Figure 11.2. Variables
are also interpolated by replacing them with their string values if they appear
inside here documents. This feature is used in a similar way to double-
quoted strings, but it is more convenient for multiple-line text.

4. Single and double quotes. Single and double quotes used by PHP to enclose
strings should be straight quotes ("") on both sides of the string. The text
editor that creates these quotes should not produce curly opening and clos-
ing quotes (“”) around the string.

There is also a string concatenate operator specified by the period (.) symbol, as
illustrated in line 6 of Figure 11.2. There are many string functions. We only illus-
trate a couple of them here. The function strtolower changes the alphabetic char-
acters in the string to all lowercase, whereas the function uewords capitalizes all the
words in a string. These are illustrated in lines 4 and 5 in Figure 11.2.

The general rule is to use single-quoted strings for literal strings that contain no
PHP program variables and the other two types (double-quoted strings and here
documents) when the values from variables need to be interpolated into the string.
For large blocks of multiline text, the program should use the here documents style
for strings.

PHP also has numeric data types for integers and floating points and generally fol-
lows the rules of the C programming language for processing these types. Numbers
can be formatted for printing into strings by specifying the number of digits that
follow the decimal point. A variation of the print function called printé (print
formatted) allows formatting of numbers within a string, as illustrated in line 3 of
Figure 11.2.

There are the standard programming language constructs of for-loops, while-loops,
and conditional if-statements. They are generally similar to their C language coun-
terparts. We will not discuss them here. Similarly, any value evaluates to true if used
as a Boolean expression except for numeric zero (0) and blank string, which evalu-
ate to false. There are also literal true and false values that can be assigned. The
comparison operators also generally follow C language rules. They are == (equal),
!= (not equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal), < (less than),
and <= (less than or equal).

11.2.2 PHP Arrays

Arrays are very important in PHP, since they allow lists of elements. They are used
frequently in forms that employ pull-down menus. A single-dimensional array is
used to hold the list of choices in the pull-down menu. For database query results,
two-dimensional arrays are used, with the first dimension representing rows of a
table and the second dimension representing columns (attributes) within a row.
There are two main types of arrays: numeric and associative. We discuss each of
these in the context of single-dimensional arrays next.
