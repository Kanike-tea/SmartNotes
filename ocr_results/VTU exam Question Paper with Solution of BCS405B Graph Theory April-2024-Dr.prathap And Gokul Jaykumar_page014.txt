indamental Cut-Sets: Consider a spanning tree 7 of a connected graph
G, Take any branch 4 in T. Since {bd} is a cut-set in 7, {5} partitions all vertices
of T into two disjoint sets—one at each end of 6. Consider the same partition ~
of vertices in G, and the cut set S in G that corresponds to this partition. Cut-
set S will contain only one branch b of 7, and the rest (if any) of the edges in
S are chords with respect to 7. Such a cut-set S containing exactly one branch
of a tree 7 is called a fundamental cut-set with respect to T. Sometimes a
fundamental cut-set is also called a basic cut-set. In Fig. 4-3, a spanning tree
