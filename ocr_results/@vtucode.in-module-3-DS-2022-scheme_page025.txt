Inorder Traversal of a Threaded Binary Tree

By using the threads, an inorder traversal can be performed without making use ofa stack.
eFor any node, ptr, in a threaded binary tree, if ptr—rightThread =TRUE, the inorder
successor of ptr is ptr —rightChild by definition ofthe threads. Otherwise we obtain the
inorder successor of ptr by following a path» of left-child links from the right-

child of ptr until we reach a node with leftThread = TRUE.

eThe function insucc () finds the inorder successor of any node in a threaded tree without

using a stack.

threadedpointer insucc(threadedPointer tree)
{ /* find the inorder successor of tree

in a threaded binary tree */

threadedpointer temp;

temp = tree-rightChild;

if (!tree-rightThread)

while (!temp—leftThread)
temp = temp-leftChild;

return temp; }
