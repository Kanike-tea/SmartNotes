604 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

Action

1. Rd [31:24] = GE3 ? Rn[31:24] : Rm[31:24];
Rd [23:16] = GE2 ? Rn[23:16] : Rm[23:16];
Rd[ 15:08] = GE1 ? Rn[15:08] : Rm[15:08];
Rd [07:00] = GEO ? Rn[07:00] : Rm[07:00]

Notes

Rd, Rn, Rm must not be pe.
See SADD for instructions that set the GE flags in the cpsr.

Set the endianness for data accesses

SETEND
1. SETEND BE ARMv6/THUMBv3
2. SETEND LE ARMv6/THUMBv3
Action
1. In the cpsr E=1 so data accesses will be big-endian
2. In the cpsr E=0 so data accesses will be little-endian
Note
ARMvé6 uses a byte-invariant endianness model. This means that byte loads and stores
are not affected by the configured endianess. For little-endian data access the byte at the
lowest address appears in the least significant byte of the loaded word. For big-endian
data accesses the byte at the lowest address appears in the most significant byte of the
loaded word.
