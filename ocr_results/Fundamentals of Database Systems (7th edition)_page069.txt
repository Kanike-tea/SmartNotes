2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces

2.3.1 DBMS Languages

Once the design of a database is completed and a DBMS is chosen to implement the
database, the first step is to specify conceptual and internal schemas for the data-
base and any mappings between the two. In many DBMSs where no strict separa-
tion of levels is maintained, one language, called the data definition language
(DDL), is used by the DBA and by database designers to define both schemas. The
DBMS will have a DDL compiler whose function is to process DDL statements in
order to identify descriptions of the schema constructs and to store the schema
description in the DBMS catalog.

In DBMSs where a clear separation is maintained between the conceptual and
internal levels, the DDL is used to specify the conceptual schema only. Another
language, the storage definition language (SDL), is used to specify the internal
schema. The mappings between the two schemas may be specified in either one of
these languages. In most relational DBMSs today, there is no specific language that
performs the role of SDL. Instead, the internal schema is specified by a combination
of functions, parameters, and specifications related to storage of files. These permit
the DBA staff to control indexing choices and mapping of data to storage. For a true
three-schema architecture, we would need a third language, the view definition
language (VDL), to specify user views and their mappings to the conceptual
schema, but in most DBMSs the DDL is used to define both conceptual and external
schemas. In relational DBMSs, SQL is used in the role of VDL to define user or
application views as results of predefined queries (see Chapters 6 and 7).

Once the database schemas are compiled and the database is populated with data,
users must have some means to manipulate the database. Typical manipulations
include retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification of the data. The DBMS pro-
vides a set of operations or a language called the data manipulation language
(DML) for these purposes.

In current DBMSs, the preceding types of languages are usually not considered dis-
tinct languages; rather, a comprehensive integrated language is used that includes
constructs for conceptual schema definition, view definition, and data manipula-
tion. Storage definition is typically kept separate, since it is used for defining physi-
cal storage structures to fine-tune the performance of the database system, which is
usually done by the DBA staff. A typical example of a comprehensive database lan-
guage is the SQL relational database language (see Chapters 6 and 7), which repre-
sents a combination of DDL, VDL, and DML, as well as statements for constraint
specification, schema evolution, and many other features. The SDL was a compo-
nent in early versions of SQL but has been removed from the language to keep it at
the conceptual and external levels only.

There are two main types of DMLs. A high-level or nonprocedural DML can be
used on its own to specify complex database operations concisely. Many DBMSs
allow high-level DML statements either to be entered interactively from a display
monitor or terminal or to be embedded in a general-purpose programming lan-
guage. In the latter case, DML statements must be identified within the program so
