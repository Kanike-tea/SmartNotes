29.6 Data Warehouse versus Views

Improved performance has also been attained with parallel processing. Parallel
server architectures include symmetric multiprocessor (SMP), cluster, and mas-
sively parallel processing (MPP), and combinations of these.

Knowledge workers and decision makers use tools ranging from parametric queries
to ad hoc queries to data mining. Thus, the access component of the data ware-
house must provide support for structured queries (both parametric and ad hoc).
Together, these make up a managed query environment. Data mining itself uses
techniques from statistical analysis and artificial intelligence. Statistical analysis can
be performed by advanced spreadsheets, by sophisticated statistical analysis soft-
ware, or by custom-written programs. Techniques such as lagging, moving aver-
ages, and regression analysis are also commonly employed. Artificial intelligence
techniques, which may include genetic algorithms and neural networks, are used
for classification and are employed to discover knowledge from the data warehouse
that may be unexpected or difficult to specify in queries. (We discussed data mining
in detail in Chapter 28.)

29.6 Data Warehouse versus Views

Some people consider data warehouses to be an extension of database views. Ear-
lier we mentioned materialized views as one way of meeting requirements for
improved access to data (see Section 7.3 for a discussion of views). Materialized
views have been explored for their performance enhancement. In Section 19.2.4,
we discussed how materialized views are maintained and used as a part of query
optimization. Views, however, provide only a subset of the functions and capabili-
ties of data warehouses. Views and data warehouses are similar in some aspects;
for example, they both have read-only extracts from databases and they allow
orientation by subject. However, data warehouses are different from views in the
following ways:

= Data warehouses exist as persistent storage instead of being materialized
on demand.

= Data warehouses are not just relational views; they are multidimensional
views with levels of aggregation.

= Data warehouses can be indexed to optimize performance. Views cannot be
indexed independent of the underlying databases.

= Data warehouses characteristically provide specific support of functionality;
views cannot.

= Data warehouses provide large amounts of integrated and often temporal
data, generally more than is contained in one database, whereas views are an
extract of a database.

= Data warehouses bring in data from multiple sources via a complex ETL
process that involves cleaning, pruning, and summarization, whereas views
are an extract from a database through a predefined query.
