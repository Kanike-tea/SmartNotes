2.2.3 Sequences of Operations and the RENAME Operation
For most queries, we need to apply several relational algebra operations one after the other. Either
we can write the operations as a single relational algebra expression by nesting the operations, or we
can apply one operation at a time and create intermediate result relations. In the latter case, we must
give names to the relations that hold the intermediate results.
For example, to retrieve the first name, last name, and salary of all employees who work in
department number 5, we must apply a SELECT and a PROJECT operation. We can write a single
relational algebra expression, also known as an in-line expression, as follows:
TUF name, Lname, Salary(6Dno=s(EMPLOYEE))

Alternatively, we can explicitly show the sequence of operations, giving a name to each intermediate
relation, as follows:

DEP5_EMPS < 6 pno-s(EMPLOYEE)

RESULT < aFname, Lname, Salary((DEP5_EMPS)
We can also use this technique to rename the attributes in the intermediate and result relations. To
rename the attributes in a relation, we simply list the new attribute names in parentheses

TEMP < opno-s(EMPLOYEE)

R(First_name, Last_name, Salary) <— 7Fname, Lname, Salary((TEMP)

If no renaming is applied, the names of the attributes in the resulting relation of a SELECT operation
are the same as those in the original relation and in the same order.For a PROJECT operation with no
renaming, the resulting relation has the same attribute names as those in the projection list and in the
same order in which they appear in the list.

We can also define a formal RENAME operation—which can rename either the relation name or the

attribute names, or both—as a unary operator.
