Fusion: A pair of vertices a, b in a graph are said to be fused (merged or
identified) if the two vertices are replaced by a single new vertex such that every
edge that was incident on either a or b or on both is incident on the new vertex.
Thus fusion of two vertices does not alter the number of edges, but it reduces the
number of vertices by one. See Fig. 2-16 for an example.

These are some of the elementary operations on graphs. More complex
operations have been defined and are used in graph-theory literature. For a
survey of such operations see the paper by Harary and Wilcox [2-10].

2-8. MORE ON EULER GRAPHS
The following are some more results on the important topic of Euler graphs.

THEOREM 2-6

A connected graph G is an Euler graph if and only if it can be decomposed
into circuits.

Proof: Suppose graph G can be decomposed into circuits; that is, G is a union
