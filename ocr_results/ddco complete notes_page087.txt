COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (21¢s34) Module 3

3. I/O Operations: The instructions are designed to perform INPUT and OUTPUT
operations. The processor uses MOV instruction to perform I/O operations.
The input Device consists of one temporary register called as DATAIN register and output register
consists of one temporary register called as DATAOUT register.
a) Input Operation: It is a process of transferring one WORD of data from DATA IN
register to processor register.
Ex: MOV DATAIN, RO
The mathematical representation of this instruction is as follows,
Ro [DATAIN]
b) Output Operation: It is a process of transferring one WORD of data from processor
register to DATAOUT register.
Ex: MOV Ro, DATAOUT
The mathematical representation of this instruction is as follows,
[Ro] DATAOUT

REGISTER TRANSFER NOTATION
e There are 3 locations to store the operands during the execution of the programynamely 1.
Register 2. Memory location 3, I/O Port. Location is the storage space used to store the
data.
e The instructions are designed to transfer data from one location to another location.
Consider the first statement to transfer data from one location to another location
e “Transfer the contents of Memory location whose symbolic name is given by AMOUNT into
processor register Ro.”
¢ The mathematical representation of this statement is given by
Ro — [AMOUNT]
Consider,the second statement to add data between two registers
e “Add the contents,of Ro with the contents of Rj and result is stored in Ro”
¢ The mathematical representation of this statement is given by
Ro [Ro] + [Ri].
Such a notations called as “Register Transfer Notation”.
It uses two symbols
1. A pair of square brackets [] to indicate the contents of Memory location and
2. < to indicate the data transfer operation.

ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE NOTATION
Consider the first statement to transfer data from one location to another location
. “ Transfer the contents of Memory location whose symbolic name is given by
AMOUNT into processor register Ro.”
. The assembly language notation of this statement is given by
MOV AMOUNT, Ro
Opcode — Source Destination
This instruction transfers 1 word of data from Memory location whose symbolic name is given by
AMOUNT into the processor register Ro.
. The mathematical representation of this statement is given by
Ro <— [AMOUNT]
