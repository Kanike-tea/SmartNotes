28.1 Overview of Data Mining Technology

data. For instance, item codes may be grouped in terms of product categories into
audio, video, supplies, electronic gadgets, camera, accessories, and so on. Zip codes
may be aggregated into geographic regions, incomes may be divided into ranges,
and so on. In Figure 29.1, we will show a process called extraction, transformation,
and load (ETL) as a precursor to the data warehouse creation. If data mining is
based on an existing warehouse for this retail store chain, we would expect that the
cleaning has already been applied. It is only after such preprocessing that data min-
ing techniques are used to mine different rules and patterns.

The result of mining may be to discover the following types of new information:

= Association rules—for example, whenever a customer buys video equip-
ment, he or she also buys another electronic gadget.

= Sequential patterns—for example, suppose a customer buys a camera, and
within three months he or she buys photographic supplies, then within six
months he is likely to buy an accessory item. This defines a sequential pattern
of transactions. A customer who buys more than twice in lean periods may be
likely to buy at least once during the December holiday shopping period.

= Classification trees—for example, customers may be classified by frequency
of visits, types of financing used, amount of purchase, or affinity for types of
items; some revealing statistics may be generated for such classes.

As this retail store example shows, data mining must be preceded by significant
data preparation before it can yield useful information that can directly influence
business decisions.

The results of data mining may be reported in a variety of formats, such as listings,
graphic outputs, summary tables, and visualizations.

28.1.3 Goals of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery

Data mining is typically carried out with some end goals or applications. Broadly
speaking, these goals fall into the following classes: prediction, identification, clas-
sification, and optimization.

= Prediction. Data mining can show how certain attributes within the data
will behave in the future. Examples of predictive data mining include the
analysis of buying transactions to predict what consumers will buy under
certain discounts, how much sales volume a store will generate in a given
period, and whether deleting a product line will yield more profits. In such
applications, business logic is used coupled with data mining. In a scientific
context, certain seismic wave patterns may predict an earthquake with high
probability.

= Identification. Data patterns can be used to identify the existence of an
item, an event, or an activity. For example, intruders trying to break a sys-
tem may be identified by the programs executed, files accessed, and CPU
time per session. In biological applications, existence of a gene may be
