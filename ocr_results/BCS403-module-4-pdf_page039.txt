5.6 Characterizing Schedules Based on Serializability

= schedules that are always considered to be correct when concurrent transactions are
executing are known as serializable schedules

= Suppose that two users—for example, two airline reservations agents—submit to the
DBMS transactions T1 and T2 at approximately the same time. If no interleaving of
operations is permitted, there are only two possible outcomes:
1. Execute all the operations of transaction T1 (in sequence) followed by all the

operations of transaction T2 (in sequence).

2. Execute all the operations of transaction T2 (in sequence) followed by all the

operations of transaction T1 (in sequence).
