> The simplified expressions produced by the map are always in one of the
two standard forms: sum of products or product of sums.

> The simplest algebraic expression is an algebraic expression with a minimum
number of terms and with the smallest possible number of literals(variable) in
each term. This expression produces a circuit diagram with a minimum number
of gates and the minimum number of inputs to each gate.

FOUR-VARIABLE K-MAP

> The map for Boolean functions of four binary variables (w, x, y, z) is shown in Fig.
3.8. In Fig. 3.8(a) are listed the 16 minterms and the squares assigned to each.

> In Fig. 3.8(b), the map is redrawn to show the relationship between the squares
and the four variables. The rows and columns are numbered in a Gray code
sequence, with only one digit changing value between two adjacent rows or
columns.

> The minterm corresponding to each square can be obtained from the
concatenation of the row number with the column number. For example, the
numbers of the third row (11) and the second column (01), when concatenated,
give the binary number 1101, the binary equivalent of decimal 13. Thus, the
square in the third row and second column represents minterm m13.

> One square represents one minterm, giving a term with four literals. Two
adjacent squares represent a term with three literals.

> Four adjacent squares represent a term with two literals. Eight adjacent squares

represent a term with one literal.
