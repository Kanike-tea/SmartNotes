printf("queue overflow\n");

return(first)
}
temp->info=item;
temp->link=NULL;
if (front==NULL)
{
rear=temp;
front=temp;
}
else
{

}
}

Function deletes the NODE in the front and returns the item
int del_front(NODE * front)
{
NODE cur;int
itemdel;
if(front==NULL)
{
printf("Queue underflow\n");
return front;
}
cur=front;
itemdel=cur->info;
front=front->link;
free(cur);
return(itemdel);

Linked stacks and queues
e We represented stacks and queues sequentially. However, when several stacks and queues
coexisted, there was no efficient way to represent them sequentially. Fig below shows linked
stack and a linked queue.
e Notice that the direction of links for both the stack and the queue facilitate easy insertion and
deletion of NODEs. We can easily add or delete a NODE from the top of the stack. We can
easily add a NODE to the rear of the queue and delete a NODE at the front.
