30.4 SQL Injection

30.4 SQL Injection

SQL injection is one of the most common threats to a database system. We will discuss
it in detail later in this section. Some of the other frequent attacks on databases are:

= Unauthorized privilege escalation. This attack is characterized by an indi-
vidual attempting to elevate his or her privilege by attacking vulnerable
points in the database systems.

= Privilege abuse. Whereas unauthorized privilege escalation is done by an
unauthorized user, this attack is performed by a privileged user. For exam-
ple, an administrator who is allowed to change student information can use
this privilege to update student grades without the instructor’s permission.

= Denial of service. A denial of service (DOS) attack is an attempt to make
resources unavailable to its intended users. It is a general attack category in
which access to network applications or data is denied to intended users by
overflowing the buffer or consuming resources.

= Weak authentication. If the user authentication scheme is weak, an attacker
can impersonate the identity of a legitimate user by obtaining her login
credentials.

30.4.1 SQL Injection Methods

As we discussed in Chapter 11, Web programs and applications that access a data-
base can send commands and data to the database, as well as display data retrieved
from the database through the Web browser. In an SQL injection attack, the
attacker injects a string input through the application, which changes or manipu-
lates the SQL statement to the attacker’s advantage. An SQL injection attack can
harm the database in various ways, such as unauthorized manipulation of the data-
base or retrieval of sensitive data. It can also be used to execute system-level com-
mands that may cause the system to deny service to the application. This section
describes types of injection attacks.

SQL Manipulation. A manipulation attack, which is the most common type of
injection attack, changes an SQL command in the application—for example, by add-
ing conditions to the WHERE-clause of a query, or by expanding a query with addi-
tional query components using set operations such as UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS.
Other types of manipulation attacks are also possible. A typical manipulation attack
occurs during database login. For example, suppose that a simplistic authentication
procedure issues the following query and checks to see if any rows were returned:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘jake’ and PASSWORD =
‘jakespassw@’ ;
The attacker can try to change (or manipulate) the SQL statement by changing it as
follows:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘jake’ and (PASSWORD =
‘jakespasswd’ or ‘x’ = ‘x’) ;
