Path and Cycle

A trail in which no vertex appears more than once is called a path.

A circuit in which the terminal vertex does not appear as an internal vertex and no internal
Vertex is repreated is called a cyele.

For example, in Figure 1.98, the trail vje1v2e3vsesv3e7v4 (shown separately in Figure
1.101(@)) is a path whereas the trail v1e4vse3v2e2V3esV5e6v4 (shown separately in Figure 1.101(b))
is not a path (because in this trail, vs appears twice).

Also, in the same Figure (i.c., in Figure 1.98), the circuit v2e2v3esvse3v2 (shown separately
in Figure 1.102(a)) is a cycle whereas the circuit ve v1 eqvsesv3e7V4e6V5e3¥2 (Shown separately
in Figure 1.102(b)) is not a cycle (because, in this circuit, vs appears twice).
