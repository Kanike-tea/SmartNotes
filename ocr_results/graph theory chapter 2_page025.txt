Both of G and G" are depicted in Figure 2.32. The vertices of G* are indicateg by
squares and its edges by dotted lines. Mal}

Some Results
The results listed below follow from the procedure used in the construction of G*:

1. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the regions of G and the vertices of G

2. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the edges of G and the edges of G*, (te |
is the edge of G* that corresponds to the edge e of G, then e” is called the dual of ¢), |

3. A pendant edge in G yields a loop in G*.

4. A loop in G yields a pendant edge in G*.

5. Edges that are in series in G yield parallel edges in G.

6. Parallel edges in G yield edges in series inG*.

7. The number of edges which form a boundary of a region R; in G is equal to the degree”
of the corresponding vertex v? in G*, and vice-versa. |

8. Like G, G* is a connected planar graph.

PREMEE Let G be a connected planar graph with n vertices, m edges and r regions, and j
let its dual G* have n* vertices, m* edges and r* regions. Then show that |

n=r, m=m re=n.
> From the way G” is constructed, every region of G yields exactly one vertex of Gm! k

G* has no other vertex. Hence the number of regions in G is precisely equal to the numb b
vertices of G*; that is f |
. oF

r=n.

Corresponding to every edge e of G, there is exactly one edge e* of G* that crosses ¢¢*

once, and G* has no other edge. Thus G and G* have the same number of edges: tha! s

OF

m =m’.

Now, the Euler’s formula applied to G* and G yields
r=m'-n'+2
=m-r+2, using (ii) and (i)

=n.
