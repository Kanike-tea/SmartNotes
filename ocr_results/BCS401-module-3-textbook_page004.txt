FIGURE 6.6 Construction of an AVL tree for the list 5, 6, 8, 3, 2, 4, 7 by successive
insertions. The parenthesized number of a rotation's abbreviation indicates
the root of the tree being reorganized.

An example of constructing an AVL tree for a given list of numbers is shown
in Figure 6.6. As you trace the algorithm’s operations, keep in mind that if there
are several nodes with the +2 balance, the rotation is done for the tree rooted at
the unbalanced node that is the closest to the newly inserted leaf.

How efficient are AVL trees? As with any search tree, the critical charac-
teristic is the tree’s height. It turns out that it is bounded both above and below
