Function to reverse a linked list
NODE* reverse(struct NODE *first)
{
NODE *prev,*cur,*next;
cur=first;
prev=NULL;
while(cur!=NULL)
{
next= cur->linkcur-
>link=prev;prev= cur;
cur=next;
}
return(prev);

}

Implementation of stack using linked list
Ina stack elements are inserted and deleted at only one end. The order of insertion and deletion follows
LIFO order. To implement stack the push operation can be implemented by using insertion in front.
Pop operation can be implemented by deletion from front so that insertion and deletion is happening
at the same end.

Implementation of queue using linked list
To implement a queue using a linked list we use two pointers the front and the rear. The front pointer
will have the address of the first NODE and the rear pointer will have the address of the last NODE.
A new NODE is always attached to the rear of the list and the NODE at the front will be deleted first.
struct node
{
int info;
struct node *link;

typedef struct node NODE;
NODE * front,*rear;
front=NULL;
rear=NULL;

Boundary condition when front=NULL queue empty

The function inserts an element at the rear of the queue
void insert_rear(int item,NODE * rear)
{

NODE temp;
temp=(NODE*)malloc(sizeof(NODE));
if(temp==NULL)
