Database Management System [BCS403]

= Serial schedule:
- Aschedule S is serial if, for every transaction T participating in the schedule, all
the operations of T are executed consecutively in the schedule.
« Otherwise, the schedule is called nonserial schedule.
= Serializable schedule:
- Aschedule S is serializable if it is equivalent to some serial schedule of the same
n transactions.
= Result equivalent:
— Two schedules are called result equivalent if they produce the same final state of
the database.
= Conflict equivalent:
- Two schedules are said to be conflict equivalent if the order of any two conflicting
operations is the same in both schedules.
= Conflict serializable:
- Aschedule S is said to be conflict serializable if it is conflict equivalent to some
serial schedule S’.

= Being serializable is not the same as being serial
= Being serializable implies that the schedule is a correct schedule.
— It will leave the database in a consistent state.
— The interleaving is appropriate and will result in a state as if the transactions
were serially executed, yet will achieve efficiency due to concurrent execution.

5.6.1 Testing conflict serializability of a Schedule S

For each transaction. Ti participating in schedule S,create a node labeled Ti in the
precedence graph.

For.each case in S where Tj executes a read_item(X) after Ti executes a write_item(X),
create an edge (Ti>T}) in the precedence graph.

For each case in S where Tj executes a write_item(X) after Ti executes a read_item (X)
,create an edge (Ti>T)) in the precedence graph.

For each case in S where Tj executes a write_item(X) after Ti executes a write_item(X),
create an edge (Ti>T}) in the precedence graph.

The schedule S is serializable if and only if the precedence graph has no cycles.
