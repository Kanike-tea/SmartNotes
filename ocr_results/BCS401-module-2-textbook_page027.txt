5.2 Quicksort 181

the size of this stack can be made to be in O(log) by always sorting first the
smaller of two subarrays obtained by partitioning, it is worse than the O(1) space
efficiency of heapsort. Although more sophisticated ways of choosing a pivot make
the quadratic running time of the worst case very unlikely, they do not eliminate
it completely. And even the performance on randomly ordered arrays is known
to be sensitive not only to implementation details of the algorithm but also to
both computer architecture and data type. Still, the January/February 2000 issue of
Computing in Science & Engineering, a joint publication of the American Institute
of Physics and the IEEE Computer Society, selected quicksort as one of the 10
algorithms “with the greatest influence on the development and practice of science
and engineering in the 20th century.”
