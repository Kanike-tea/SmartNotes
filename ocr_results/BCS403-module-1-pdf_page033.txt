Introduction

Conceptual modeling is a very important phase in designing a successful database application.
Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a popular high-level conceptual data model. This model and its
variations are frequently used for the conceptual design of database applications, and many

database design tools employ its concepts.

Figure 3.1: A simplified diagram to illustrate the main phases of database design.
The first step shown is requirements collection and analysis. During this step, the database
designers interview prospective database users to understand and document their data
requirements. The result of this step is a concisely written set of users’ requirements.
These requirements should be specified in as detailed and complete a form as possible. In parallel

with specifying the data requirements, it is useful to specify the known functional requirements
