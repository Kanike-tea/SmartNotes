If (x, y, z) isa scalar point function and A = Aji +A, j+A3k isa vector point
function of x,y,z we have the following. :

Geometrically, grad is a vector normal to the surface o(x, y, z) = ¢, ¢ being
a constant. “

If Vix, y, Z) represents any physical quantity, div V gives the rate at which the
physical quantity is originating at that point per unit volume.

Supposing that a fluic) is moving such.that its velocity at any point is given by
(x, y, z)then div:V gives the total gain in the volume of the fluid per unit volume
per unit time, . fs . oo

div V = is the continuity equation of an incompressible fluid. Further a vector
A. whose divergence is zero is called a solenoidal vector. :

Curl_means rotation. A vector function A(x, y, z) is said to be irrotational if
curl A is a null vector. “urther if A(x, yz) is irratational, then there always exists

ascalar function (x,y,z) such that Vo=A. Then $(x, y,z) is called
the scalar potential cf A.
