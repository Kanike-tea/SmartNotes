Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures

Another solution to the problem of reliability is to store extra information that is not
normally needed but that can be used to reconstruct the lost information in case of
disk failure. The incorporation of redundancy must consider two problems: select-
ing a technique for computing the redundant information, and selecting a method of
distributing the redundant information across the disk array. The first problem is
addressed by using error-correcting codes involving parity bits, or specialized codes
such as Hamming codes. Under the parity scheme, a redundant disk may be consid-
ered as having the sum of all the data in the other disks. When a disk fails, the miss-

ing information can be constructed by a process similar to subtraction.

For the second problem, the two major approaches are either to store the redun-
dant information on a small number of disks or to distribute it uniformly across all
disks. The latter results in better load balancing. The different levels of RAID choose
a combination of these options to implement redundancy and improve reliability.

16.10.2 Improving Performance with RAID

The disk arrays employ the technique of data striping to achieve higher transfer
rates. Note that data can be read or written only one block at a time, so a typical
transfer contains 512 to 8,192 bytes. Disk striping may be applied at a finer granu-
larity by breaking up a byte of data into bits and spreading the bits to different
disks. Thus, bit-level data striping consists of splitting a byte of data and writing
bit j to the jth disk. With 8-bit bytes, eight physical disks may be considered as one
logical disk with an eightfold increase in the data transfer rate. Each disk partici-
pates in each I/O request and the total amount of data read per request is eight
times as much. Bit-level striping can be generalized to a number of disks that is
either a multiple or a factor of eight. Thus, in a four-disk array, bit n goes to the disk

which is (n mod 4). Figure 16.13(a) shows bit-level striping of data.

The granularity of data interleaving can be higher than a bit; for example, blocks of
a file can be striped across disks, giving rise to block-level striping. Figure 16.13(b)
shows block-level data striping assuming the data file contains four blocks. With
block-level striping, multiple independent requests that access single blocks (small
requests) can be serviced in parallel by separate disks, thus decreasing the queuing
time of I/O requests. Requests that access multiple blocks (large requests) can be
parallelized, thus reducing their response time. In general, the more the number of
disks in an array, the larger the potential performance benefit. However, assuming
independent failures, the disk array of 100 disks collectively has 1/100th the reli-
ability of a single disk. Thus, redundancy via error-correcting codes and disk mir-

roring is necessary to provide reliability along with high performance.

16.10.3 RAID Organizations and Levels

Different RAID organizations were defined based on different combinations of the
two factors of granularity of data interleaving (striping) and pattern used to com-
pute redundant information. In the initial proposal, levels 1 through 5 of RAID

were proposed, and two additional levels—0 and 6—were added later.
