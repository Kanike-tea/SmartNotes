The heart-lung machine works by circulating blood outside of the body through a series
of tubes and pumps. Blood is taken from the body, oxygenated, and then returned to the body. This
allows the heart to be stopped during the surgery without causing any harm to the patient.

The use of a heart-lung machine during surgery carries some risks, including the potential
for blood clots, bleeding, and infections. Additionally, there may be some long-term effects on
the body, such as cognitive decline, that are not yet fully understood. However, the use ofa
heart-lung machine has revolutionized the field of cardiovascular surgery, allowing for more
complex procedures to be performed and greatly improving patient outcomes.

Artificial Lungs

Artificial lungs are devices designed to mimic the function of the natural respiratory system.
They are used to support patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung
injury (ALI) and to help the patient's own lungs recover and heal.

Types

There are two main types of artificial lungs: membrane oxygenators and extracorporeal
lung assist devices.
