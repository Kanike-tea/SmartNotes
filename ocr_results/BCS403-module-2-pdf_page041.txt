Database Management System [BCS403]

« The propagate (CASCADE) option for the referential triggered action should be specified
on the foreign keys in the relation corresponding to the relationship R, since each
relationship instance has an existence dependency on each of the entities it relates. This
can be used for both ON UPDATE and ON DELETE.

Step 6: Mapping of Multivalued Attributes

= For each multivalued attribute
+ Create a new relation
+ Primary key of R is the combination of A and K
+ Ifthe multivalued attribute is composite, include its simple components

= In our example, we create a relation DEPT_LOCATIONS

" The attribute Dlocation represents the multivalued attribute LOCATIONS of
DEPARTMENT, while Dnumber—as foreign key—tepresents the primary key of the
DEPARTMENT relation.

* The primary key of DEPT_LOCATIONS is the combination of {Dnumber, Dlocation}

= A separate tuple will exist in DEPT_LOCATIONS for each location that a department has

" The propagate (CASCADE) option for the referential triggered action should be specified
on the foreign key in the relation R corresponding to the multivalued attribute for both ON
UPDATE and ON DELETE.
