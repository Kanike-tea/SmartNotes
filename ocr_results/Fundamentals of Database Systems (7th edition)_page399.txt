12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts

3. Collection (or multivalued) type constructors include the set(T), list(T),
bag(T), array(T), and dictionary(K,T) type constructors. These allow part
of an object or literal value to include a collection of other objects or values
when needed. These constructors are also considered to be type generators
because many different types can be created. For example, set(string),
set(integer), and set(Employee) are three different types that can be created
from the set type constructor. All the elements in a particular collection
value must be of the same type. For example, all values in a collection of type
set(string) must be string values.

The atom constructor is used to represent all basic atomic values, such as integers,
real numbers, character strings, Booleans, and any other basic data types that the
system supports directly. The tuple constructor can create structured values and
objects of the form <aj:i), aytiz) ... , a,:i,>, where each a; is an attribute name® and
each i is a value or an OID.

The other commonly used constructors are collectively referred to as collection
types but have individual differences among them. The set constructor will create
objects or literals that are a set of distinct elements {i), iz, ... , in}, all of the same
type. The bag constructor (also called a multiset) is similar to a set except that the
elements in a bag need not be distinct. The list constructor will create an ordered list
[i1, i2, ..., in] of OIDs or values of the same type. A list is similar to a bag except that
the elements in a list are ordered, and hence we can refer to the first, second, or jth
element. The array constructor creates a single-dimensional array of elements of
the same type. The main difference between array and list is that a list can have an
arbitrary number of elements whereas an array typically has a maximum size.
Finally, the dictionary constructor creates a collection of key-value pairs (K, V),
where the value of a key K can be used to retrieve the corresponding value V.

The main characteristic of a collection type is that its objects or values will be a col-
lection of objects or values of the same type that may be unordered (such as a set or a
bag) or ordered (such as a list or an array). The tuple type constructor is often
called a structured type, since it corresponds to the struct construct in the C and
C++ programming languages.

An object definition language (ODL)’ that incorporates the preceding type con-
structors can be used to define the object types for a particular database application.
In Section 12.3 we will describe the standard ODL of ODMG, but first we introduce
the concepts gradually in this section using a simpler notation. The type construc-
tors can be used to define the data structures for an OO database schema. Fig-
ure 12.1 shows how we may declare EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT types.

In Figure 12.1, the attributes that refer to other objects—such as Dept of EMPLOYEE
or Projects of DEPARTMENT—are basically OIDs that serve as references to other
objects to represent relationships among the objects. For example, the attribute Dept

®Also called an instance variable name in OO terminology.

This corresponds to the DDL (data definition language) of the database system (see Chapter 2).
