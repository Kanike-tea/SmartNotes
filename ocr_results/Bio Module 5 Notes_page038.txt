The olfactory bulb processes and relays the signals to other brain regions involved in
olfaction and perception.

7. Neural Interpretation: In the brain, the neural signals are further analyzed and interpreted.
Different combinations of activated olfactory receptor cells and their corresponding
signals contribute to the perception of specific aromas. The brain's interpretation of these
signals allows us to differentiate and recognize different smells.

The Electronic Nose

The electrical nose, also known as an electronic nose, is a technology used in food
science for the analysis and characterization of food and beverage aromas and flavors. The
electrical nose typically consists of a sensor array that is capable of detecting and quantifying
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in food and beverage samples.

Technology behind the Electronic Nose

The sensors in the electrical nose work by measuring the changes in electrical resistance
or capacitance that occur when the sensors are exposed to volatile organic compounds. Each
sensor in the array is designed to respond to a specific range of volatile organic compounds, and
the combination of signals from all of the sensors allows for the analysis of the overall aroma
and flavor profile of a sample.

Sensor Array in Electronic Nose

In electronic nose applications, a sensory array refers to a collection of multiple sensors
that are designed to detect and analyze odor molecules. The sensors in the array are often
selective to different chemical properties or patterns, allowing for the identification and
differentiation of various odors. Here are some examples of sensor types commonly used in
sensory arrays for electronic noses:

Metal Oxide Sensors (MOS):

Metal oxide sensors, such as tin oxide (SnOz) or zinc oxide (ZnO) sensors, are widely
used in electronic noses. They detect changes in electrical resistance when exposed to different
odor molecules. MOS sensors offer broad sensitivity to a wide range of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs).

Conducting Polymer Sensors:

Conducting polymer sensors are made of organic polymers that undergo changes in
electrical conductivity when exposed to specific odor molecules. These sensors can be tailored to
be selective to different types of odors based on the polymer composition.

Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) Sensors:

QCM sensors measure changes in the resonance frequency of a quartz crystal due to the adsorption
of odor molecules. These sensors are highly sensitive and can provide information about the mass
and viscoelastic properties of the detected odorants.

Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensors:

SAW sensors utilize acoustic waves that propagate across the surface of a piezoelectric
