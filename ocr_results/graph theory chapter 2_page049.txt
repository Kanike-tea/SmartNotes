2.6 Map Colouring

In Section 2.2, we noted that a plane representation (drawing) of a planar graph divides a plane
into a number of parts called regions (or faces) of which only one is exterior. We say that these
regions are properly coloured if no two adjacent regions have the same colour. By adjacent
regions we mean regions which have a common edge between them. Two regions having one
©r more Common vertices are not regarded as adjacent regions. A proper colouring of regions
is called map colouring in view of the fact that an atlas is always coloured in such a way that
countries with common boundaries have different colours.

The following Figure illustrates a proper colouring of regions of a planar graph.

From the way the dual of a planar graph is defined (constructed), it follows that a proper

colouring of the regions of a Planar graph G is e i
‘ quivalent to a vertices
of its dual G*, and vice-versa, Thus, the proble iibgde ember does
