28.5.5 Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a class of randomized search procedures capable
of adaptive and robust search over a wide range of search space topologies. Mod-
eled after the adaptive emergence of biological species from evolutionary mecha-
nisms, and introduced by Holland,° GAs have been successfully applied in such
diverse fields as image analysis, scheduling, and engineering design.

Genetic algorithms extend the idea from human genetics of the four-letter
alphabet (based on the A, C, T, G nucleotides) of the human DNA code. The
construction of a genetic algorithm involves devising an alphabet that encodes
the solutions to the decision problem in terms of strings of that alphabet.
Strings are equivalent to individuals. A fitness function defines which solu-
tions can survive and which cannot. The ways in which solutions can be com-
bined are patterned after the cross-over operation of cutting and combining
strings from a father and a mother. An initial population of a well-varied pop-
ulation is provided, and a game of evolution is played in which mutations
occur among strings. They combine to produce a new generation of individu-
als; the fittest individuals survive and mutate until a family of successful solu-
tions develops.

The solutions produced by GAs are distinguished from most other search
techniques by the following characteristics:

= AGA search uses a set of solutions during each generation rather than a
single solution.

= The search in the string-space represents a much larger parallel search in the
space of encoded solutions.

= The memory of the search done is represented solely by the set of solutions
available for a generation.

= A genetic algorithm is a randomized algorithm since search mechanisms use
probabilistic operators.

= While progressing from one generation to the next, a GA finds near-optimal
balance between knowledge acquisition and exploitation by manipulating
encoded solutions.

Genetic algorithms are used for problem solving and clustering problems. Their
ability to solve problems in parallel provides a powerful tool for data mining. The
drawbacks of GAs include the large overproduction of individual solutions, the
random character of the searching process, and the high demand on computer pro-
cessing. In general, substantial computing power is required to achieve anything of
significance with genetic algorithms.

®Holland’s seminal work (1976) entitled Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems introduced the idea
of genetic algorithms.
