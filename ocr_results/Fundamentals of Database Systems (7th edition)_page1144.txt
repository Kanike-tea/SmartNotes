1114 Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP

ParAccel of Tableau Software. Big data analytics have driven Hadoop and other
specialized databases such as graph and key-value stores into the next generation of
data warehousing (see Chapter 25 for a discussion of big data technology based on
Hadoop). Data virtualization platforms such as the one from Cisco* will enable
such logical data warehouses to be built in the future.

29.5 Typical Functionality of a Data Warehouse

Data warehouses exist to facilitate complex, data-intensive, and frequent ad hoc
queries. Accordingly, data warehouses must provide far greater and more efficient
query support than is demanded of transactional databases. The data warehouse
access component supports enhanced spreadsheet functionality, efficient query
processing, structured queries, ad hoc queries, data mining, and materialized views.
In particular, enhanced spreadsheet functionality includes support for state-of-the-
art spreadsheet applications (for example, MS Excel) as well as for OLAP applica-
tions programs. These enhanced spreadsheet products offer preprogrammed
functionalities such as the following:

= Roll-up (also drill-up). Data is summarized with increasing generalization

(for example, weekly to quarterly to annually).

= Drill-down. Increasing levels of detail are revealed (the complement of
roll-up).
Pivot. Cross tabulation (also referred to as rotation) is performed.
Slice and dice. Projection operations are performed on the dimensions.
Sorting. Data is sorted by ordinal value.
Selection. Data is filtered by value or range.

Derived (computed) attributes. Attributes are computed by operations on
stored and derived values.

Because data warehouses are free from the restrictions of the transactional environ-
ment, there is an increased efficiency in query processing. Among the tools and
techniques used are query transformation; index intersection and union; special
ROLAP (relational OLAP) and MOLAP (multidimensional OLAP) functions; SQL
extensions; advanced join methods; and intelligent scanning (as in piggy-backing
multiple queries).

There is also a HOLAP (hybrid OLAP) option available that combines both ROLAP
and MOLAP. For summary-type information, HOLAP leverages cube technology
(using MOLAP) for faster performance. When detailed information is needed,
HOLAP can “drill through” from the cube into the underlying relational data
(which is in the ROLAP component).
