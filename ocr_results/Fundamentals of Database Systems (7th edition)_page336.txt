306 Chapter 9 Relational Database Design by ER- and EER-to-Relational Mapping

9.13. Consider the EER design for the GRADE_BOOK database that was modeled
using a tool like ERwin or Rational Rose in Laboratory Exercise 4.28. Using
the SQL schema generation feature of the modeling tool, generate the SQL
schema for an Oracle database.

9.14. Consider the EER design for the ONLINE_AUCTION database that was mod-
eled using a tool like ERwin or Rational Rose in Laboratory Exercise 4.29.
Using the SQL schema generation feature of the modeling tool, generate the
SQL schema for an Oracle database.

Selected Bibliography

The original ER-to-relational mapping algorithm was described in Chen’s classic
paper (Chen, 1976). Batini et al. (1992) discuss a variety of mapping algorithms
from ER and EER models to legacy models and vice versa.
