12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts

The inheritance model discussed in this section is very simple. As we will see in Sec-
tion 12.3, the ODMG model distinguishes between type inheritance—called inter-
face inheritance and denoted by a colon (:)—and the extent inheritance
constraint—denoted by the keyword EXTEND.

12.1.6 Other Object-Oriented Concepts

Polymorphism of Operations (Operator Overloading). Another characteris-
tic of OO systems in general is that they provide for polymorphism of operations,
which is also known as operator overloading. This concept allows the same opera-
tor name or symbol to be bound to two or more different implementations of the
operator, depending on the type of objects to which the operator is applied. A sim-
ple example from programming languages can illustrate this concept. In some lan-
guages, the operator symbol “+” can mean different things when applied to
operands (objects) of different types. If the operands of “+” are of type integer, the
operation invoked is integer addition. If the operands of “+” are of type floating
point, the operation invoked is floating-point addition. If the operands of “+” are of
type set, the operation invoked is set union. The compiler can determine which
operation to execute based on the types of operands supplied.

In OO databases, a similar situation may occur. We can use the GEOMETRY_OBJECT
example presented in Section 12.1.5 to illustrate operation polymorphism!>
in ODB. In this example, the function Area is declared for all objects of type
GEOMETRY_OBJECT. However, the implementation of the method for Area may
differ for each subtype of GEOMETRY_OBJECT. One possibility is to have a general
implementation for calculating the area of a generalized GEOMETRY_OBJECT (for
example, by writing a general algorithm to calculate the area of a polygon) and then
to rewrite more efficient algorithms to calculate the areas of specific types of geo-
metric objects, such as a circle, a rectangle, a triangle, and so on. In this case, the
Area function is overloaded by different implementations.

The ODMS must now select the appropriate method for the Area function based on
the type of geometric object to which it is applied. In strongly typed systems, this
can be done at compile time, since the object types must be known. This is termed
early (or static) binding. However, in systems with weak typing or no typing (such
as Smalltalk, LISP, PHP, and most scripting languages), the type of the object to
which a function is applied may not be known until runtime. In this case, the func-
tion must check the type of object at runtime and then invoke the appropriate
method. This is often referred to as late (or dynamic) binding.

Multiple Inheritance and Selective Inheritance. Multiple inheritance occurs
when a certain subtype T is a subtype of two (or more) types and hence inherits the
functions (attributes and methods) of both supertypes. For example, we may create

'5in programming languages, there are several kinds of polymorphism. The interested reader is referred to
the Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter for works that include a more thorough discussion.
