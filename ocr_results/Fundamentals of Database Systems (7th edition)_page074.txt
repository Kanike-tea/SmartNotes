them into an internal form. This internal query is subjected to query optimization
(discussed in Chapters 18 and 19). Among other things, the query optimizer is
concerned with the rearrangement and possible reordering of operations, elimina-
tion of redundancies, and use of efficient search algorithms during execution. It
consults the system catalog for statistical and other physical information about the
stored data and generates executable code that performs the necessary operations
for the query and makes calls on the runtime processor.

Application programmers write programs in host languages such as Java, C, or C++
that are submitted to a precompiler. The precompiler extracts DML commands
from an application program written in a host programming language. These com-
mands are sent to the DML compiler for compilation into object code for database
access. The rest of the program is sent to the host language compiler. The object
codes for the DML commands and the rest of the program are linked, forming a
canned transaction whose executable code includes calls to the runtime database
processor. It is also becoming increasingly common to use scripting languages such
as PHP and Python to write database programs. Canned transactions are executed
repeatedly by parametric users via PCs or mobile apps; these users simply supply
the parameters to the transactions. Each execution is considered to be a separate
transaction. An example is a bank payment transaction where the account number,
payee, and amount may be supplied as parameters.

In the lower part of Figure 2.3, the runtime database processor executes (1) the
privileged commands, (2) the executable query plans, and (3) the canned transac-
tions with runtime parameters. It works with the system catalog and may update it
with statistics. It also works with the stored data manager, which in turn uses basic
operating system services for carrying out low-level input/output (read/write)
operations between the disk and main memory. The runtime database processor
handles other aspects of data transfer, such as management of buffers in the main
memory. Some DBMSs have their own buffer management module whereas others
depend on the OS for buffer management. We have shown concurrency control
and backup and recovery systems separately as a module in this figure. They are
integrated into the working of the runtime database processor for purposes of
transaction management.

It is common to have the client program that accesses the DBMS running on a
separate computer or device from the computer on which the database resides. The
former is called the client computer running DBMS client software and the latter is
called the database server. In many cases, the client accesses a middle computer,
called the application server, which in turn accesses the database server. We elabo-
rate on this topic in Section 2.5.

Figure 2.3 is not meant to describe a specific DBMS; rather, it illustrates typical
DBMS modules. The DBMS interacts with the operating system when disk accesses—
to the database or to the catalog—are needed. If the computer system is shared by
many users, the OS will schedule DBMS disk access requests and DBMS processing
along with other processes. On the other hand, if the computer system is mainly
dedicated to running the database server, the DBMS will control main memory
