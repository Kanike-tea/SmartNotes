27.6.2 Average Precision

Average precision is computed based on the precision at each relevant document in
the ranking. This measure is useful for computing a single precision value to com-
pare different retrieval algorithms on a query q.

Consider the sample precision values of relevant documents in Table 27.2. The
average precision (Pavg value) for the example in Table 27.2 is P(1) + P(2) + P(3) +
P(7) + P(8) + P(10)/6 = 79.93% (only relevant documents are considered in this
calculation). Many good algorithms tend to have high top-k average precision for
small values of k, with correspondingly low values of recall.

27.6.3 Recall/Precision Curve

A recall/precision curve can be drawn based on the recall and precision values at
each rank position, where the x-axis is the recall and the y-axis is the precision.
Instead of using the precision and recall at each rank position, the curve is com-
monly plotted using recall levels r(i) at 0%, 10%, 20% ... 100%. The curve usually
has a negative slope, reflecting the inverse relationship between precision and recall.

27.6.4 F-Score

F-score (F) is the harmonic mean of the precision (p) and recall (r) values. That is,
