for precision bioprinting because the quality of fabricated construct is completely
dependent upon the accuracy of the anatomical model. Although in vivo cell distribution
can be realized by clinical imaging, it is rather difficult to utilize image processing tools
to obtain anatomically accurate skin geometry. This is the reason that maturation of the
printed tissue construct is required, especially in case of in vitro bioprinting, in which the
printed construct undergoes maturation in a bioreactor as compared to in sifu printing in
which maturation occurs on the body itself at the injury site where the construct is
printed.

3D Bioprinting of Bone Tissue

Bone is structurally complex, highly vascularized tissue in nature and is composed of a
ceramic phase in a gel like matrix of protein and polysaccharides as described in below
figure). Several bone fractures and osteo-degenerative diseases caused by incidences of
trauma or any injuries related to diseases or dysfunctional tissue can direct to chronic bone
defects that necessitates regeneration of bones that can restore those damaged tissue.
Available techniques have some limitations in mimicking bone hierarchical anatomy and
construction at a large human scale.

They lack cross talking in 3D niche among different cell types (osteoblasts, osteoclasts and
endothelial cells) and the tissue construct formed can be inconsistent). Hydrogels used for
bone Tissue Engineering are incapable to form mineralized matrix. To overcome these
problems, 3D bioprinting, used for bone TE, possesses several benefits, over conventional TE
methods, such as they provide enough mechanical backing during regeneration of injured
tissues.

Steps Involved in 3D Bioprinting of Bone Tissue

Bone bioprinting involves three successive phases viz., I) pre-processing, II) processing and
III) post-processing phase. In first (pre-processing) phase, all of the requirements related to
bio printed tissue formation will be planned. Anatomical structure analysis of targeted tissue
following CAD for translating images into blue print of 3D bio printed tissue by using CT,
MRI etc. data. Additional special programs related to software, e.g., AutoCAD,
