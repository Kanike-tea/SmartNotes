control to their Oracle Database applications. Label-based security provides an
adaptable way of controlling access to sensitive data. Both users and data have labels
associated with them. Oracle label security uses these labels to provide security.

30.10.1 Virtual Private Database (VPD) Technology

Virtual private databases (VPDs) are a feature of the Oracle Enterprise Edition
that add predicates to user statements to limit their access in a transparent manner
to the user and the application. The VPD concept allows server-enforced, fine-
grained access control for a secure application.

VPD provides access control based on policies. These VPD policies enforce object-
level access control or row-level security. VPD provides an application program-
ming interface (API) that allows security policies to be attached to database tables
or views. Using PL/SQL, a host programming language used in Oracle applications,
developers and security administrators can implement security policies with the
help of stored procedures.” VPD policies allow developers to remove access security
mechanisms from applications and centralize them within the Oracle Database.

VPD is enabled by associating a security “policy” with a table, view, or synonym.
An administrator uses the supplied PL/SQL package, DBMS_RLS, to bind a policy
function with a database object. When an object having a security policy associated
with it is accessed, the function implementing this policy is consulted. The policy
function returns a predicate (a WHERE clause) that is then appended to the user’s
SQL statement, thus transparently and dynamically modifying the user’s data
access. Oracle label security is a technique of enforcing row-level security in the
form of a security policy.

30.10.2 Label Security Architecture

Oracle label security is built on the VPD technology delivered in the Oracle Data-
base 11.1 Enterprise Edition. Figure 30.4 illustrates how data is accessed under Ora-
cle label security, showing the sequence of DAC and label security checks.

Figure 30.4 shows the sequence of discretionary access control (DAC) and label
security checks. The left part of the figure shows an application user in an Oracle
Database 11g Release 1 (11.1) session sending out an SQL request. The Oracle
DBMS checks the DAC privileges of the user, making sure that he or she has SELECT
privileges on the table. Then it checks whether the table has a virtual private data-
base (VPD) policy associated with it to determine if the table is protected using
Oracle label security. If it is, the VPD SQL modification (WHERE clause) is added to
the original SQL statement to find the set of accessible rows for the user to view.
Then Oracle label security checks the labels on each row to determine the subset of
rows to which the user has access (as explained in the next section). This modified
query is processed, optimized, and executed.
