¢ Keyboard is connected to a processor using a parallel-port.
¢ Processor uses
— memory-mapped I/O and
— asynchronous bus protocol.
© On the processor-side of the interface, we have:
— Data-lines
— Address-lines
— Control or R/W line
— Master-Ready signal and
— Slave-Ready signal.
© On the keyboard-side of the interface, we have:
— Encoder-circuit which generates a code for the key pressed.
— Debouncing-circuit which eliminates the effect of a key.
— Data-lines which contain the code for the key.
— Valid line changes from 0 to 1 when the key is pressed. This causes the code to be
loaded into DATAIN and SIN to be set to 1.
