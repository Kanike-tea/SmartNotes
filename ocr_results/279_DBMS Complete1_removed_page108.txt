Except in these three cases, any alteration can be possible while creating S2 by modifying S1.

Object Oriented Databases

Object oriented databases are also called Object Database Management Systems (ODBMS).
Object databases store objects rather than data such as integers, strings or real numbers. Objects
are used in object oriented languages such as Smalltalk, C++, Java, and others. Objects
basically consist of the following:

¢ Attributes - Attributes are data which defines the characteristics of an object. This data
may be simple such as integers, strings, and real numbers or it may be a reference to a
complex object.

¢ Methods - Methods define the behavior of an object and are what was formally called
procedures or functions.

Therefore objects contain both executable code and data
Object Persistence

With traditional databases, data manipulated by the application is transient and data in the
database is persisted (Stored on a permanent storage device). In object databases, the
application can manipulate both transient and persisted data.

When to Use Object Databases

Object databases should be used when there is complex data and/or complex data relationships.
This includes a many to many object relationship. Object databases should not be used when
there would be few join tables and there are large volumes of simple transactional data.

Object databases work well with:

¢ CAS Applications (CASE-computer aided software engineering, CAD-computer aided
design, CAM-computer aided manufacture)

e Multimedia Applications

¢ Object projects that change over time.

¢ Commerce

Object Database Advantages over RDBMS

¢ Objects don't require assembly and disassembly saving coding time and execution time to
assemble or disassemble objects.

Reduced paging

Easier navigation

Better concurrency control - A hierarchy of objects may be locked.

Data model is based on the real world.

Works well for distributed architectures.

Less code required when applications are object oriented.

Object Database Disadvantages compared to RDBMS

Lower efficiency when data is simple and relationships are simple.
Relational tables are simpler.

Late binding may slow access speed.

More user tools exist for RDBMS.

Standards for RDBMS are more stable.
