c. Calculate the average time it takes to find a record by doing a linear search
on the file if (i) the file blocks are stored contiguously, and double buffer-
ing is used; (ii) the file blocks are not stored contiguously.

d. Assume that the file is ordered by Ssn; by doing a binary search, calculate
the time it takes to search for a record given its Ssn value.

Suppose that only 80% of the STUDENT records from Exercise 16.28 have a
value for Phone, 85% for Major_dept_code, 15% for Minor_dept_code, and 90%
for Degree_program; and suppose that we use a variable-length record file.
Each record has a 1-byte field type for each field in the record, plus the 1-byte
deletion marker and a 1-byte end-of-record marker. Suppose that we use a
spanned record organization, where each block has a 5-byte pointer to the
next block (this space is not used for record storage).

a. Calculate the average record length R in bytes.
b. Calculate the number of blocks needed for the file.

Suppose that a disk unit has the following parameters: seek time s = 20 msec;
rotational delay rd = 10 msec; block transfer time btt = 1 msec; block size
B = 2400 bytes; interblock gap size G = 600 bytes. An EMPLOYEE file has
the following fields: Ssn, 9 bytes; Last_name, 20 bytes; First_name, 20 bytes;
Middle_init, 1 byte; Birth_date, 10 bytes; Address, 35 bytes; Phone, 12 bytes;
Supervisor_ssn, 9 bytes; Department, 4 bytes; Job_code, 4 bytes; deletion
marker, 1 byte. The EMPLOYEE file has r = 30,000 records, fixed-length
format, and unspanned blocking. Write appropriate formulas and calculate
the following values for the above EMPLOYEE file:

a. Calculate the record size R (including the deletion marker), the blocking
factor bfr, and the number of disk blocks b.

b. Calculate the wasted space in each disk block because of the unspanned
organization.

c. Calculate the transfer rate tr and the bulk transfer rate btr for this disk
unit (see Appendix B for definitions of tr and btr).

d. Calculate the average number of block accesses needed to search for an
arbitrary record in the file, using linear search.

e. Calculate in msec the average time needed to search for an arbitrary
record in the file, using linear search, if the file blocks are stored on con-
secutive disk blocks and double buffering is used.

f. Calculate in msec the average time needed to search for an arbitrary
record in the file, using linear search, if the file blocks are not stored on
consecutive disk blocks.

g. Assume that the records are ordered via some key field. Calculate the
average number of block accesses and the average time needed to search
for an arbitrary record in the file, using binary search.

A PARTS file with Part# as the hash key includes records with the following
Part# values: 2369, 3760, 4692, 4871, 5659, 1821, 1074, 7115, 1620, 2428,
