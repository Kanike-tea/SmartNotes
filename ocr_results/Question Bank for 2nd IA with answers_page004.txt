* In the renal tubules, the filtrate passes through a series of specialized cells, such as proximal tubular
cells and distal tubular cells, which reabsorb important substances such as glucose, amino acids, and

electrolytes back into the bloodstream.

+ At the same time, the renal tubules secrete waste products, such as urea and creatinine, back into the

filtrate.

* Finally, the filtered fluid, now known as urine, is transported through the renal pelvis and ureters to
the bladder, where it is eventually eliminated from the body.
This process of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion helps to maintain the proper balance of fluids and

electrolytes in the body, as well as to remove waste and excess substances.

Ans.

The architecture of the lung is designed to maximize surface area for efficient gas exchange. The lung is divided into
several parts, including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.

Trachea: The trachea is the main airway that leads from the larynx (voice box) to the lungs. It is lined with cilia and

mucus-secreting glands that help to filter out harmful substances and trap them in the mucus.
