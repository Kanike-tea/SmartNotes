LAB PROGRAM 10 (a)

10 a) Write a Python program to draw Time Series using Plotly Libraries.

Aim: Demonstration of how to draw time series using plotly libraries.

PROGRAM EXPLANATION

To draw time series plots using the Plotly library in Python, you can follow the example below.

Make sure you have Plotly installed:

pip install plotly
pip install numpy

This Python program uses the Plotly library to create a time series plot comparing the high and

low stock prices of Tesla. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program:

1.

Import necessary libraries: The program imports the required modules:
plotly.graph_objects for creating the plot, plotly.offline for offline plotting, and pandas

for data manipulation.

. Read time series data: The code reads time series data related to Tesla stock prices from a

CSV file and stores it in a DataFrame named tesla.

. Create traces for high and low stock prices: Two traces (trace_one and trace_two) are

created using the Scatter class from plotly.graph_objects. Each trace represents a line plot
with x-axis as dates and y-axis as either the high or low stock prices. The line parameter
is used to set the color of the lines, and opacity controls the transparency.

Organize data and layout: The data for the plot is organized into a list (data), which
contains the two traces created earlier. The layout dictionary contains layout settings for

the plot, including the title.

. Create a dictionary representing the figure: The fig dictionary is created, containing both

the data and layout information. This structure is required by Plotly to represent a
complete figure.

Plot the figure and save as an HTML file: The pyo.plot function generates an HTML file
named 'Tesla Stock Comparison.html' and opens it in a web browser. The resulting plot

shows the time series comparison of Tesla's high and low stock prices.
