conceptual schema (full database definition) of a component database, and the
component schema is derived by translating the local schema into a canonical data
model or common data model (CDM) for the FDBS. Schema translation from the
local schema to the component schema is accompanied by generating mappings to
transform commands on a component schema into commands on the correspond-
ing local schema. The export schema represents the subset of a component schema
that is available to the FDBS. The federated schema is the global schema or view,
which is the result of integrating all the shareable export schemas. The external
schemas define the schema for a user group or an application, as in the three-level
schema architecture.

All the problems related to query processing, transaction processing, and directory
and metadata management and recovery apply to FDBSs with additional consider-
ations. It is not within our scope to discuss them in detail here.

23.7.4 An Overview of Three-Tier Client/Server Architecture

As we pointed out in the chapter introduction, full-scale DDBMSs have not been
developed to support all the types of functionalities that we have discussed so far.
Instead, distributed database applications are being developed in the context of the
client/server architectures. We introduced the two-tier client/server architecture in
