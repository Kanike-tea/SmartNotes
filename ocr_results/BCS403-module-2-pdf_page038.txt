Database Management System [BCS403]

= Ifmultiple keys were identified for E during the conceptual design, the information
describing the attributes that form each additional key is kept in order to specify secondary
(unique) keys of relation R

= In our example-COMPANY database, we create the relations EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT,
and PROJECT

= we choose Ssn, Dnumber, and Pnumber as primary keys for the relations EMPLOYEE,
DEPARTMENT, and PROJECT, respectively

= The relations that are created from the mapping of entity types are called entity relations

because each tuple represents an entity instance.

EMPLOYEE
Fname | Minit | Lname | Ssn | Bdate | Address |¢Sex | Salary
DEPARTMENT

Dname | Dnumber

PROJECT

Pname | Pnumber | Plocation

Step 2: Mapping of Weak Entity Types

= For each weak entity type, create a relation R and include all simple attributes of the entity
type as attributes of R

= Include primary key attribute of owner as foreign key attributes of R

= In our example, we create the relation DEPENDENT in this step to correspond to the weak
entity type DEPENDENT

= We include the primary key Ssn of the EMPLOYEE relation—which corresponds to the
owner entity type—as a foreign key attribute of DEPENDENT; we rename it as Essn

= The primary key of the DEPENDENT relation is the combination {Essn,Dependent_name},
because Dependent_name is the partial key of DEPENDENT

= It is common to choose the propagate (CASCADE) option for the referential triggered action
on the foreign key in the relation corresponding to the weak entity type, since a weak entity
has an existence dependency on its owner entity.

= This can be used for both ON UPDATE and ON DELETE.

DEPENDENT
Essn Dependent_name | Sex | Bdate | Relationship
