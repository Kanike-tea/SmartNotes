9. What is muscular dystrophy? Briefly discuss the various bioengineering solutions for
muscular dystrophy.

Ans. Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that result in progressive weakness
and degeneration of the skeletal muscles, which are responsible for movement. The disorders
are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins needed for muscle function. The most
common type of muscular dystrophy is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which typically affects
young boys and leads to severe disability by early adulthood. Other forms of the disease include
Becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and facioscapulohumeral
dystrophy, among others.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) usually appears early in childhood between the ages of
2 and 3. DMD primarily affects boys but can affect girls in rare cases. The primary symptom
of DMD is muscle weakness that begins in the muscles close to the body and later affects
muscles in the outer limbs.
