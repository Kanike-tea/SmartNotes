Methods used for the Separation or Removal of Metals

After the steps of microbial adsorption and sequestration of heavy metals, the subsequent
separation or removal of metals from the contaminated site can be achieved through different
methods. Here are a few common approaches:

Phytoremediation:

In this method, plants are used to remove heavy metals from the soil or water. The metal-
accumulating ability of certain plant species, called hyperaccumulators, allows them to take up
metals from the environment and store them in their tissues. After the plants have absorbed the
metals, they can be harvested and disposed of properly, effectively removing the metals from the
site.

Chemical extraction:

Chemical agents can be applied to the contaminated area to facilitate the release of heavy
metals from the microbial biomass or the surrounding matrix. Chelating agents, such as
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or citric acid, can be used to form complexes with the
metals, increasing their solubility and facilitating their removal.

Biosor ption:

In this method, the metal-loaded microbial biomass or biofilms can be harvested and
separated from the site. The biomass can then be processed to recover the metals through techniques
such as acid leaching or thermal treatment. The metals can be further purified or recycled for various
industrial applications.

Physical removal:

In some cases, physical methods such as sedimentation, filtration, or membrane
separation can be employed to separate the metal-loaded microbial biomass or biofilms from the
surrounding environment. These techniques rely on the physical properties of the biomass or
biofilms, such as size, density, or adsorption capacity, to separate them from the water or soil.

Electrochemical methods:

Electrochemical techniques, such as electrokinetic remediation or electrocoagulation, can
be utilized to remove heavy metals from the contaminated site. These methods involve the
application of an electric field or the generation of metal precipitates through electrochemical
reactions, resulting in the migration or precipitation of metal ions, which can then be collected
and removed.

Advantages of Bioremediation and Biomining

e Environmentally friendly: The use of microorganisms to remove heavy metals from
contaminated environments or ore deposits is an environmentally friendly alternative to
traditional methods such as chemical leaching, which can produce toxic waste products.

e Cost-effective: Bioremediation and biomining using microbial surface adsorption is often
less expensive than traditional methods for removing heavy metals, as it does not require
the use of costly chemicals or equipment.
