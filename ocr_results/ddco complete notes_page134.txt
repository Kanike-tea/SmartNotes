Digital Design and Computer Organization (BCS302)

Consider how the idea of pipelining can be used in a computer. The processor executes
a program by fetching and executing instructions, one after the other.

Let Fi and Ei refer to the fetch and execute steps for instruction Ii . Execution of a
program consists of a sequence of fetch and execute steps, as shown in Figure a.

(b) Hardware organization

Now consider a computer that has two separate hardware units, one for fetching
instructions and another for executing them, as shown in Figure b. The instruction
fetched by the fetch unit is deposited in an intermediate storage buffer, B1. This buffer
is needed to enable the execution unit to execute the instruction while the fetch unit is
fetching the next instruction. The results of execution are deposited in the destination
location specified by the instruction.

The computer is controlled by a clock.

any instruction fetch and execute steps completed in one clock cycle.

Operation of the computer proceeds as in Figure 8.1c.

In the first clock cycle, the fetch unit fetches an instruction I1 (step F1) and
stores it in buffer B1 at the end of the clock cycle.

In the second clock cycle, the instruction fetch unit proceeds with the fetch
operation for instruction 12 (step F2). Meanwhile, the execution unit performs the
operation specified by instruction I1, which is available to it in buffer B1 (step E1).
By the end of the second clock cycle, the execution of instruction I1 is completed
and instruction I2 is available. Instruction I2 is stored in B1, replacing I1, which is
no longer needed.

Step E2 is performed by the execution unit during the third clock cycle, while
instruction I3 is being fetched by the fetch unit. In this manner, both the fetch and
execute units are kept busy all the time. If the pattern in Figure 8.1c can be
sustained for a long time, the completion rate of instruction execution will be twice
that achievable by the sequential operation depicted in Figure a.
