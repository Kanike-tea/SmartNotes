Capacity of a cut-set ‘

|. LetG be a weighted connected graph and S be a cut-set in G,, Then the sum of the wei,

of all edges in S is called the capacity of S. ;

For example, consider the graph shown in Figure 4.36 and make it weighted by ASSigning :
‘or € .

the weights to its edges as given below:
wt(e1) = 4, wt(er) = 2, wees) = 1, we(ea) = 2, wiles) = 3, wt(es) = 6/ wt(e7) = 4,
Then the Secutt) of the cut-set S = {e1, e4, e7} in this graph is

wt(e1) + wt(e4) + wt(e7) =4424+4= 10. f

Edge-connectivity

Let G be a connected graph and S' be a‘cut-set in G that contains fewest number of edges.

The number of edges in S is called the edge-connectivity (or the line connectivity) of G. In
