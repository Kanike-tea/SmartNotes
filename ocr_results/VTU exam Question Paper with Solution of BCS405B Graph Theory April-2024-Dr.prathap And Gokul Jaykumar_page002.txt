1a) (i) A walk can be defined as a sequence of edges and vertices of a
graph. When we have a graph and traverse it, then that traverse will be
known as a walk. In a walk, there can be repeated edges and vertices.

(ii) A path is a walk without repeating vertices or edges.

(iii) A circuit is a sequence of adjacent nodes starting and ending at the
same node. Circuits never repeat edges.

b) To prove that if a connected graph is decomposed into two subgraphs
gl and g2 there must be at least one vertex common between g1 and g2,
we can use proof by contradiction.

Assume that there exists a connected graph G that can be decomposed
into two subgraphs g1 and g2 such that there is no vertex common
