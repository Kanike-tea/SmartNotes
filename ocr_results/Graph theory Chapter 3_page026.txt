step 3- If v = v1, the tree 7 is the spanning tree for the order specified:

Step 4. For v # v1, back track from v. If w is the parent of the vertex assigned to v in T, then
assign u to v and return to Step 2.

The spanning tree of G determined by using the above steps is called the depth-first search
spanning tree for G for the given order of vertices of G,

We now illustrate the use of the DFS algorithm by determining a spanning tree T for the
graph shown below (Figure 3.29) wherein the order of the vertices are as indicated in the a

First we assign the first vertex vy . the variable v and initialize ? T as just the vertex v; (the
Moot). Going to Step 2, we find that the vertex v2 is the first vertex w such that {v1,w} € E and
whas not been visited (consideréd) earlier. So, we attach the edge (vy, va) to T, assign v2 to v,
andretumn the Step 2. _

Atv = vy) we find that the first adjacent vertex (not visited earlier) that provides an edge
for T is v7. Consequently, the edge {v2, v7} is attached to T, v7 is assigned to v, and we again

Aty = V7 we find that the first adjacent vertex (not visited earlier) that provides an edge for
Sig Consequently, the edge {v7, v3} is gy to T, v3 is assed to v and we return to

Now, we note that there is no new vertex which we can obtain from v3, because the adjacent
“1 has already been visited: So'we go to Step 3. Since v = v3 and v3 is not the first vertex,
