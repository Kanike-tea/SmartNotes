Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

3. Constraints that cannot be directly expressed in the schemas of the data
model, and hence must be expressed and enforced by the application pro-
grams or in some other way. We call these application-based or semantic
constraints or business rules.

The characteristics of relations that we discussed in Section 5.1.2 are the inherent
constraints of the relational model and belong to the first category. For example, the
constraint that a relation cannot have duplicate tuples is an inherent constraint. The
constraints we discuss in this section are of the second category, namely, constraints
that can be expressed in the schema of the relational model via the DDL. Constraints
in the third category are more general, relate to the meaning as well as behavior of
attributes, and are difficult to express and enforce within the data model, so they are
usually checked within the application programs that perform database updates. In
some cases, these constraints can be specified as assertions in SQL (see Chapter 7).

Another important category of constraints is data dependencies, which include
functional dependencies and multivalued dependencies. They are used mainly for
testing the “goodness” of the design of a relational database and are utilized in a
process called normalization, which is discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.

The schema-based constraints include domain constraints, key constraints, con-
straints on NULLs, entity integrity constraints, and referential integrity constraints.

5.2.1 Domain Constraints

Domain constraints specify that within each tuple, the value of each attribute A must
be an atomic value from the domain dom(A). We have already discussed the ways in
which domains can be specified in Section 5.1.1. The data types associated with
domains typically include standard numeric data types for integers (such as short
integer, integer, and long integer) and real numbers (float and double-precision float).
Characters, Booleans, fixed-length strings, and variable-length strings are also avail-
able, as are date, time, timestamp, and other special data types. Domains can also be
described by a subrange of values from a data type or as an enumerated data type in
which all possible values are explicitly listed. Rather than describe these in detail here,
we discuss the data types offered by the SQL relational standard in Section 6.1.

5.2.2 Key Constraints and Constraints on NULL Values

In the formal relational model, a relation is defined as a set of tuples. By definition,
all elements of a set are distinct; hence, all tuples in a relation must also be distinct.
This means that no two tuples can have the same combination of values for all their
attributes. Usually, there are other subsets of attributes of a relation schema R with
the property that no two tuples in any relation state r of R should have the same
combination of values for these attributes. Suppose that we denote one such subset
of attributes by SK; then for any two distinct tuples t) and f; ina relation state r of R,
we have the constraint that:

t,(SK] # [SK]
