me state space of the system is { train (t), bus (b) .
oO era process is a Markov.chain since the outcome of any day depends only
n the happening of the previous day.The t-p-m isas follows.

The first Tow of the matrix is related to the fact that the person does not commute two
consecutive days by train and is sure to go:by bus if he had travelled. by train. The
second row of the matrix is related to the fact that if the person had commuted in bus
ona particular day he is likely to go by bus again or by train. Thus the probabilities are,
equal to 1/2. “, 8 “ on ,

2. Threeboys A, B, C are throwing ball to each other-A always throws the ball to B and
B always throws the ball to C. C is just as likely to throw the ball to B as to A. ,

© Higher transition probabilities a .

The entry p;, in the transition probability matrix P of the Markov chain is the
probability that the system changes from the state a; to a, in a single step. That is

The probability that the system changes from the state a; to the state 4, in exactly

n steps is denoted by pn)

The matrix formed by the probabilities pf i ) is called the 1 - step
transition matrix denoted by P‘"? " 93 ;

[P™] =[ Py )] is obviously a stochastic matrix. ‘
It can be proved that the m step transition matrix is equal to the ath power of P.

That is P‘") = P™
