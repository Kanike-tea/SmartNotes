It is not difficult to prove (Problem 9-1) that in any digraph G the sum of all
in-degrees is equal to the sum of all out-degrees, each sum being equal to the
number of edges in G; that is,

Yao) = Lae).

An isolated vertex is a vertex in which the in-degree and the out-degree are
both equal to zero. A vertex v in a digraph is called pendant if it is of degree one,
that is, if

d*(v)+d-(v)=1.

Two directed edges are said to be parallel if they are mapped onto the same
ordered pair of vertices. That is, in addition to being parallel in the sense of
undirected edges, parallel directed edges must also agree in the direction of their
arrows. In Fig. 9-1, edges eg, eg, and 49 are parallel, whereas edges e, and e3 are
not.

Since many properties of directed graphs are the same as those of undirected
ones, it is often convenient to disregard the orientations of edges in a digraph.
Such an undirected graph obtained from a directed graph G will be called the
undirected graph corresponding to G.

On the other hand, given an undirected graph H, we can assign each edge of H
some arbitrary direction. The resulting digraph, designated by # is called an
orientation of H (or a digraph associated with H). Note that while a given
digraph has a unique (within isomorphism) undirected graph corresponding to it,
a given undirected graph may have ”different“ orientations possible. This is why
we say the undirected graph corresponding to a digraph, but an orientation of a
graph.

This brings us to the question: When are two digraphs considered to be the
same or isomorphic?
