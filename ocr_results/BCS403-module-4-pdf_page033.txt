Database Management System [BCS403]

4. The Unrepeatable Read Problem
= Transaction T reads the same item twice and gets different values on each read, since
the item was modified by another transaction T’ between the two reads.
= for example, if during an airline reservation transaction, a customer inquires about seat
availability on several flights
= When the customer decides on a particular flight, the transaction then reads the number
of seats on that flight a second time before completing the reservation, and it may end
up reading a different value for the item.
5.2.4 Why Recovery Is Needed
= Whenever a transaction is submitted to a DBMS for execution, the system is responsible
for making sure that either
1. All the operations in the transaction are completed successfully and their effect is
recorded permanently in the database or
2.The transaction does not have any effect on the database or any other
transactions
= In the first case, the transaction is said to be committed, whereas in the second case,
the transaction is aborted
= If a transaction fails after executing some: of its operations but before executing all of

them, the operations already executed must be undone and have no lasting effect.

Types of failures

1. A computer failure (system crash):
+ »A hardware, software, or network error occurs in the computer system during
transaction execution
+ Hardware crashes are usually media failures—for example, main memory failure.
2. Atransaction or system error:
+ Some operation in the transaction may cause it to fail, such as integer overflow or
division by zero
+ Also occur because of erroneous parameter values
3. Local errors or exception conditions detected by the transaction:
+ During transaction execution, certain conditions may occur that necessitate cancellation

of the transaction
