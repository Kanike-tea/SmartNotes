4A. Minimal Spanning Tree -' ae

Figure 4:4

Using Kruskal’s algorithm, find a minimal spanning tree for the weighted graph
shown below:

Figure 4.5

» The given graph has 6 vertices and therefore a spanning tree thereof will have 5 edges. Let
"Ss put the edges of the graph in the non-decreasing order of their weights and go on selecting
S edges one by one in such a way that no cycle is created. The scheme is summarized below:

“ll Bdge | cr | pr | or| BO | BR | 4B | BC | AQ | PO
| Weight | 5°] 7.| 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 10] 41 | 12
Select? | Yes | Yes | Yes.| Yes | No | Yes |
