Four ways to specify the query Q0 in QBE.

We can think of each column in a QBE template as an implicit domain variable;
hence, Fname corresponds to the domain variable q, Minit corresponds to r, ..., and
Dno corresponds to z. In the QBE query, the columns with P. correspond to vari-
ables specified to the left of the bar in domain calculus, whereas the columns with
constant values correspond to tuple variables with equality selection conditions on
them. The condition EMPLOYEE(qrstuvwxyz) and the existential quantifiers are
implicit in the QBE query because the template corresponding to the EMPLOYEE
relation is used.

In QBE, the user interface first allows the user to choose the tables (relations) needed
to formulate a query by displaying a list of all relation names. Then the templates for
the chosen relations are displayed. The user moves to the appropriate columns in
the templates and specifies the query. Special function keys are provided to move
among templates and perform certain functions.

We now give examples to illustrate basic facilities of QBE. Comparison operators
other than = (such as > or 2) may be entered in a column before typing a constant
value. For example, the query QOA: List the social security numbers of employees who
work more than 20 hours per week on project number 1 can be specified as shown in
Figure C.3(a). For more complex conditions, the user can ask for a condition box,
which is created by pressing a particular function key. The user can then type the
complex condition.!

'Negation with the — symbol is not allowed in a condition box.
