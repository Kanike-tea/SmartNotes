include the surrogate key attribute Owner_id as foreign key in each relation corre-
sponding to a superclass of the category, to specify the correspondence in values
between the surrogate key and the original key of each superclass. Notice that if a
particular PERSON (or BANK or COMPANY) entity is not a member of OWNER, it
would have a NULL value for its Owner_id attribute in its corresponding tuple in the
PERSON (or BANK or COMPANY) relation, and it would not have a tuple in the
OWNER relation. It is also recommended to add a type attribute (not shown in Fig-
ure 9.7) to the OWNER relation to indicate the particular entity type to which each
tuple belongs (PERSON or BANK or COMPANY).

For a category whose superclasses have the same key, such as VEHICLE in Figure 4.8,
there is no need for a surrogate key. The mapping of the REGISTERED_VEHICLE
category, which illustrates this case, is also shown in Figure 9.7.

9.3 Summary

In Section 9.1, we showed how a conceptual schema design in the ER model can
be mapped to a relational database schema. An algorithm for ER-to-relational
mapping was given and illustrated by examples from the COMPANY database.
Table 9.1 summarized the correspondences between the ER and relational
model constructs and constraints. Next, we added additional steps to the algo-
rithm in Section 9.2 for mapping the constructs from the EER model into the
relational model. Similar algorithms are incorporated into graphical database
design tools to create a relational schema from a conceptual schema design
automatically.

Review Questions

9.1. (a) Discuss the correspondences between the ER model constructs and the
relational model constructs. Show how each ER model construct can be
mapped to the relational model and discuss any alternative mappings.
(b) Discuss the options for mapping EER model constructs to relations, and
the conditions under which each option could be used.

Exercises

9.2. Map the UNIVERSITY database schema shown in Figure 3.20 into a rela-
tional database schema.

9.3. Try to map the relational schema in Figure 6.14 into an ER schema. This is
part of a process known as reverse engineering, where a conceptual schema
is created for an existing implemented database. State any assumptions
you make.
