8.1 Representing a Digital Signal 263

8.1.1.1 Saturating Fixed-Point Representation

Suppose the maximum value of the signal is not known, but there is a clear range in which
the vast majority of samples lie. In this case you can use a fixed-point representation based
on the common range. You then saturate or clip any out-of-range samples to the closest
available sample in the normal range. This approach gives greater accuracy at the expense
of some distortion of very loud signals. See Section 7.7 for hints on efficient saturation.

8.1.1.2 Block-Floating Representation

When small sample values are close to large sample values, they are usually less important.
In this case, you can divide the signal into blocks or frames of samples. You can use
a different fixed-point scaling on each block or frame according to the strength of the signal
in that block or frame.

This is similar to floating point except that we associate a single exponent with a whole
frame rather than a single sample. You can use efficient fixed-point operations to operate
on the samples within the frame, and you only need costly, exponent-related operations
when comparing values among frames.

8.1.1.3 Logarithmic Representation

Suppose your signal x[t] has a large dynamic range. Suppose also that multiplication
operations are far more frequent than addition. Then you can use a base-two logarithmic
representation. For this representation we consider the related signal y[t]:

ylt] = logy (x[t]) (8.5)
Represent y[t] using a fixed-point format. Replace operations of the form
xa] = x[b] x x[c] by y[a] = y[b] + yle] (8.6)
and operations of the form
x{a] = x[b] + x{e] by ya] = y[b] + log, (1 + laste) (8.7)

In the second case we arrange that y[c] < y[b]. Calculate the function f(x) = log,(1 + 2*)
by using lookup tables and/or interpolation. See Section 7.5 for efficient implementations
of logy(x) and 2°.
