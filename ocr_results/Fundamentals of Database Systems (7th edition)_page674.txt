Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design

the other hand, the attributes listed in item 4 are candidates for avoiding an access
structure, since modifying them will require updating the access structures.

B. Analyzing the Expected Frequency of Invocation of Queries and
Transactions. Besides identifying the characteristics of expected retrieval que-
ries and update transactions, we must consider their expected rates of invocation.
This frequency information, along with the attribute information collected on
each query and transaction, is used to compile a cumulative list of the expected
frequency of use for all queries and transactions. This is expressed as the expected
frequency of using each attribute in each file as a selection attribute or a join attri-
bute, over all the queries and transactions. Generally, for large volumes of pro-
cessing, the informal 80-20 rule can be used: approximately 80% of the processing
is accounted for by only 20% of the queries and transactions. Therefore, in practi-
cal situations, it is rarely necessary to collect exhaustive statistics and invocation
rates on all the queries and transactions; it is sufficient to determine the 20% or so
most important ones.

C. Analyzing the Time Constraints of Queries and Transactions. Some que-
ries and transactions may have stringent performance constraints. For example, a
transaction may have the constraint that it should terminate within 5 seconds on
95% of the occasions when it is invoked, and that it should never take more than 20
seconds. Such timing constraints place further priorities on the attributes that are
candidates for access paths. The selection attributes used by queries and transac-
tions with time constraints become higher-priority candidates for primary access
structures for the files, because the primary access structures are generally the most
efficient for locating records in a file.

D. Analyzing the Expected Frequencies of Update Operations. A minimum
number of access paths should be specified for a file that is frequently updated,
because updating the access paths themselves slows down the update operations. For
example, if a file that has frequent record insertions has 10 indexes on 10 different
attributes, each of these indexes must be updated whenever a new record is inserted.
The overhead for updating 10 indexes can slow down the insert operations.

E. Analyzing the Uniqueness Constraints on Attributes. Access paths should
be specified on all candidate key attributes—or sets of attributes—that are either the
primary key ofa file or unique attributes. The existence of an index (or other access
path) makes it sufficient to search only the index when checking this uniqueness
constraint, since all values of the attribute will exist in the leaf nodes of the index.
For example, when inserting a new record, if key attribute value of the new record
already exists in the index, the insertion of the new record should be rejected, since
it would violate the uniqueness constraint on the attribute.

Once the preceding information is compiled, it is possible to address the physical
database design decisions, which consist mainly of deciding on the storage struc-
tures and access paths for the database files.
