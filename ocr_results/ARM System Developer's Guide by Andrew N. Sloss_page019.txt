INSTRUCTION SET FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

The ARM instruction set differs from the pure RISC definition in several ways that make
the ARM instruction set suitable for embedded applications:

Variable cycle execution for certain instructions—Not every ARM instruction executes
in a single cycle. For example, load-store-multiple instructions vary in the number
of execution cycles depending upon the number of registers being transferred. The
transfer can occur on sequential memory addresses, which increases performance since
sequential memory accesses are often faster than random accesses. Code density is also
improved since multiple register transfers are common operations at the start and end
of functions.

Inline barrel shifter leading to more complex instructions—The inline barrel shifter is
a hardware component that preprocesses one of the input registers before it is used
by an instruction. This expands the capability of many instructions to improve core
performance and code density. We explain this feature in more detail in Chapters 2, 3,
and 4.

Thumb 16-bit instruction set-—ARM enhanced the processor core by adding a second
16-bit instruction set called Thumb that permits the ARM core to execute either
16- or 32-bit instructions. The 16-bit instructions improve code density by about
30% over 32-bit fixed-length instructions.

Conditional execution—An instruction is only executed when a specific condition has
been satisfied. This feature improves performance and code density by reducing branch
instructions.

Enhanced instructions—The enhanced digital signal processor (DSP) instructions were
added to the standard ARM instruction set to support fast 16x 16-bit multiplier oper-
ations and saturation. These instructions allow a faster-performing ARM processor in
some cases to replace the traditional combinations of a processor plus a DSP.

These additional features have made the ARM processor one of the most commonly

used 32-bit embedded processor cores. Many of the top semiconductor companies around
the world produce products based around the ARM processor.

1.3 EMBEDDED SYSTEM HARDWARE

Embedded systems can control many different devices, from small sensors found on
a production line, to the real-time control systems used on a NASA space probe. All
these devices use a combination of software and hardware components. Each component
is chosen for efficiency and, if applicable, is designed for future extension and expansion.
