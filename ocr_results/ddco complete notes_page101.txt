There are 2 schemes available to connect I/O devices to CPU
1. Memory mapped I/O:
e In this technique, both memory and I/O devices use the common bus to

transfer the data to CPU .

e« same address space is used for both memory and I/O interface. They have
only one set of read and write signals.
e All memory related instructions are used for data transfer between I/O and

processor.
Memory Mapped 10

« Incase of memory mapped I/O input operation can be

implemented as, MOVE DATAIN , RO
Source destination

This instruction sends the contents of location DATAIN to register RO.

¢ Similarly output can be implemented as, MOVE R panjour

Source Destination

¢The data is written from RO to DATAOUT location (address of output buffer.
2) 1/O Mapped 1/0:
> In this technique, a separate bus is used for I/O devices and memory to transfer
the data to CPU. Address space for memory and I/O devices are different.
> Hence two sets of instruction are used for data transfer.
> One set for memory operations and another set for I/O
operations. Whole address space is available for the program.
