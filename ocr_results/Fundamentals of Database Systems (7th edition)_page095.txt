Two entities,
EMPLOYEE ej, and
COMPANY cy, and
their attributes.

Several types of attributes occur in the ER model: simple versus composite, single-
valued versus multivalued, and stored versus derived. First we define these attribute
types and illustrate their use via examples. Then we discuss the concept of a NULL
value for an attribute.

Composite versus Simple (Atomic) Attributes. Composite attributes can be
divided into smaller subparts, which represent more basic attributes with indepen-
dent meanings. For example, the Address attribute of the EMPLOYEE entity shown
in Figure 3.3 can be subdivided into Street_address, City, State, and Zip,° with the
values ‘2311 Kirby’, ‘Houston’, ‘Texas’, and ‘77001’. Attributes that are not divisible
are called simple or atomic attributes. Composite attributes can form a hierarchy;
for example, Street_address can be further subdivided into three simple component
attributes: Number, Street, and Apartment_number, as shown in Figure 3.4. The value
of a composite attribute is the concatenation of the values of its component simple
attributes.

Composite attributes are useful to model situations in which a user sometimes
refers to the composite attribute as a unit but at other times refers specifically to its

Address
Street_address City State Zip
Number Street. Apartment_number

8Zip Code is the name used in the United States for a five-digit postal code, such as 76019, which can
be extended to nine digits, such as 76019-0015. We use the five-digit Zip in our examples.
