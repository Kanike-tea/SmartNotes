Database Management System [BCS403]

= In this variation, a transaction T that issues a read_item(X) or write_item(X) such
that TS(7) > write_TS(X) has its read or write operation de/ayed until the transaction
T that wrote the value of X (hence TS(T) = write_TS(X)) has committed or aborted.

= To implement this algorithm, it is necessary to simulate the locking of an item X that
has been written by transaction T until T is either committed or aborted. This

algorithm does not cause deadlock, since T waits for T only if TS(T) > TS(T_).

Thomas’s Write Rule
= A modification of the basic TO algorithm, known as Thomas’s write rule, does not

enforce conflict serializability, but it rejects fewer write operations by modifying the

checks for the write_item(X) operation as follows:

1. If read_TS(X) > TS(7), then abort and roll back 7 and reject the operation.

2. If write_TS(X) > TS(7), then do not execute the write operation but continue
processing. This is because some transaction with timestamp greater than TS(T}—
and hence after T in the timestamp ordering—has already written the value of X.
Thus, we must ignore the write_item(X) operation of T because it is already outdated
and obsolete. Notice that any conflict arising from this situation would be detected by
case (1).

If neither the condition in part (1) nor the condition in part (2) occurs, then execute
the write_item(X) operation of T and set write_TS(X) to TS(7).

5.14 Multiversion Concurrency Control Techniques

= Other protocols for concurrency control keep the old values of a data item when the
item is updated. These are known as multiversion concurrency control, because
several versions (values) of an item are maintained

«When a transaction requires access to an item, an appropriate version is chosen to
maintain the serializability of the currently executing schedule, if possible.

= The idea is that some read operations that would be rejected in other techniques can
still be accepted by reading an older version of the item to maintain serializability. When
a transaction writes an item, it writes a new version and the old version(s) of the item
are retained

= An obvious drawback of multiversion techniques is that more storage is needed to maintain
multiple versions of the database items
