15.1 Further Topics in Functional Dependencies: Inference Rules, Equivalence, and Minimal Cover

Each of the preceding inference rules can be proved from the definition of functional
dependency, either by direct proof or by contradiction. A proof by contradiction
assumes that the rule does not hold and shows that this is not possible. We now prove
that the first three rules IR1 through IR3 are valid. The second proof is by contradiction.

Proof of IR1. Suppose that X > Y and that two tuples f; and f exist in some rela-
tion instance r of R such that t; [X] = tf [X]. Then f;[Y] = t;[Y] because XD Y;
hence, X — Y must hold in r.

Proof of IR2 (by contradiction). Assume that X > Y holds ina relation instance
r of R but that XZ — YZ does not hold. Then there must exist two tuples
and fin r such that (1) f [X] = t [X], (2) h [Y] = b [Y], (3) th [XZ] = b [XZ],
and (4) t; [YZ] # ft) [YZ]. This is not possible because from (1) and (3) we
deduce (5) t; [Z] = t) [Z], and from (2) and (5) we deduce (6) t; [YZ] = t [YZ],
contradicting (4).

Proof of IR3. Assume that (1) X — Y and (2) Y > Z both hold in a relation r.
‘Then for any two tuples t, and f in r such that ft; [X] = f [X], we must have (3)
t, [Y] = t [Y], from assumption (1); hence we must also have (4) ty [Z] = t [Z]
from (3) and assumption (2); thus X — Z must hold in r.

There are three other inference rules that follow from IR1, IR2 and IR3. They are
as follows:

IR4 (decomposition, or projective, rule): {X > YZ} |=X > Y.
IR5 (union, or additive, rule): {X > Y, X > Z} |=X > YZ.
IR6 (pseudotransitive rule): {X > Y, WY > Z} |=WX > Z.

The decomposition rule (IR4) says that we can remove attributes from the right-
hand side of a dependency; applying this rule repeatedly can decompose the
FD X > {Aj, Ad, ... , An} into the set of dependencies {X + Aj, X > Ap, ...,X > Ay}.
The union rule (IR5) allows us to do the opposite; we can combine a set of depen-
dencies {X — Aj, X > A, ..., X > A,} into the single FD X — {A), Ag, ... , An}-
The pseudotransitive rule (IR6) allows us to replace a set of attributes Y on the left-
hand side of a dependency with another set X that functionally determines Y, and
can be derived from IR2 and IR3 if we augment the first functional dependency
X — Ywith W (the augmentation rule) and then apply the transitive rule.

One important cautionary note regarding the use of these rules: Although X > A and
X — Bimplies X — AB by the union rule stated above, X — A and Y > B does imply
that XY — AB. Also, XY — A does not necessarily imply either X A or YA.

Using similar proof arguments, we can prove the inference rules IR4 to IR6 and any
additional valid inference rules. However, a simpler way to prove that an inference
rule for functional dependencies is valid is to prove it by using inference rules that
have already been shown to be valid. Thus IR4, IRS, and IR6 are regarded as a corol-
lary of the Armstrong’s basic inference rules. For example, we can prove IR4 through
IR6 by using /R1 through IR3. We present the proof of IR5 below. Proofs of IR4 and IR6
using IR1 through IR3 are left as an exercise for the reader.
