4. Leaf nodes are still required to be half full.
5. Insertion and deletion are handled in the same way as insertion and deletion of entries in a

B+-tree index.

B-Tree Index Files
1. Similar to B+-tree, but B-tree allows search-key values to appear only once; eliminates
redundant storage of search keys.
2. Search keys in non leaf nodes appear nowhere else in the B-tree; an additional pointer field
for each search key in a non leaf node must be included.
3. Generalized B-tree leaf node

Advantages of B-Tree indices:
> May use less tree nodes than a corresponding B+-Tree.
> Sometimes possible to find search-key value before reaching leaf node.
Disadvantages of B-Tree indices:
> Only small fraction of all search-key values are found early
> Non-leaf nodes are larger, so fan-out is reduced. Thus, B-Trees typically have
greater depth than corresponding B+-Tree
