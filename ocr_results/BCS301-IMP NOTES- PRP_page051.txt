8) Three boys A, B, C are throwing ball to each other. “A” always throws the ball to “B” and “B”
always throws ball to “C”. “C” is just as likely to throw the ball to “B” as to “A”. If, “C” was the
first person to throw the ball, find the probabilities that after three throws.
i) A has the ball
ii) B has the ball
iii) C has the ball

Sol": Given three boys A, B, C are throwing a ball associated with the transition probability matrix of the
Markov chain as below,

Initially if C has the ball, associated with the initial probability vector is given by p =[0 0 1]

Thus, after three throws, the probability M the ball is with A is p,® = 5 with B is pp® = = and
with C is pe® = +

9) A gambler’s luck follows a pattern: if he wins a game, the probability of winning next game is 0.6.
However, he loses the game, the probability of losing the next game is 0.7. There is an even chance
of gambler winning the first game if so,

i) What is the probability of winning second game.
ii) What is the probability of winning the third game.
iii) In the long run, how often he will win.

Sol": Let W = Win the game , L = Lose the game
The transition probability matrix is given,
— [Pww Put) [? 6 0.4
Pw Pu 0.3 0.7.
And we know that the probability of winning and losing have the equal priority.
