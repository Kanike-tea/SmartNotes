26.2 Temporal Database Concepts 977

other interpretations are intended for time, the user can define the semantics and
program the applications appropriately, and this interpretation of time is called a
user-defined time.

The next section shows how these concepts can be incorporated into relational
databases, and Section 26.2.3 shows an approach to incorporate temporal concepts
into object databases.

26.2.2 Incorporating Time in Relational Databases
Using Tuple Versioning

Valid Time Relations. Let us now see how the different types of temporal databases
may be represented in the relational model. First, suppose that we would like to include
the history of changes as they occur in the real world. Consider again the database in
Figure 26.1, and let us assume that, for this application, the granularity is day. Then,
we could convert the two relations EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT into valid time
relations by adding the attributes Vst (Valid Start Time) and Vet (Valid End Time),
whose data type is DATE in order to provide day granularity. This is shown in Fig-
ure 26.7(a), where the relations have been renamed EMP_VT and DEPT_VT, respectively.

Consider how the EMP_VT relation differs from the nontemporal EMPLOYEE rela-
tion (Figure 26.1).!° In EMP_VT, each tuple V represents a version of an employee’s

15 nontemporal relation is also called a snapshot relation because it shows only the current snapshot
or current state of the database.
