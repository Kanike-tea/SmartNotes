Abort (abt): Privileged mode entered due to a failed memory access (data abort or prefetch abort)53
. It has banked registers r13_abt, r14_abt, and spsr_abt101.

Interrupt Request (irq): Privileged mode for handling general-purpose interrupts53 . It has banked
registers r13_irq, r14_irq, and spsr_irq101 .

Fast Interrupt Request (fiq): High-priority privileged mode for time-critical interrupts. It has the most
banked registers (r8_fiq to r14_fig, and spsr_fiq)53 ....

Undefined (und): Privileged mode entered when the processor encounters an undefined or
unsupported instruction53 .... It has banked registers r13_und, r14_und, and spsr_und101.

System (sys): A special privileged version of User mode that allows full read-write access to the
cpsr54 . It does not have its own banked registers (it uses the user mode registers)101 .

The processor mode can be changed by software writing directly to the mode bits of the cpsr (if ina
privileged mode) or by hardware in response to an exception or interrupt55 .

Embedded Software

(This is a repetition of point 6) Embedded system software is crucial for driving the hardware37 . It
typically consists of several components organized in abstraction layers37 ...:

Initialization (Boot) Code (Firmware): Executed first after reset to configure the hardware (memory,
peripherals, etc.) and load the operating system or application38 .... It often includes memory
remapping and diagnostic routines40 ....

Operating System (OS): Manages system resources and provides an environment for applications.
This can range from simple schedulers to full-fledged RTOSs (for real-time applications) or platform
OSs (like Linux for more complex systems)38 ..

Device Drivers: Provide a standardized software interface to interact with the hardware
peripherals44 .
