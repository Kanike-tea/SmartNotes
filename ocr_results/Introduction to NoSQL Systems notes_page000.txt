Introduction to NoSQL Systems

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) systems are a class of database management systems that diverge
from the traditional relational model by offering flexible data models, high scalability, and
distributed architecture. NoSQL databases are designed to efficiently handle large volumes
of unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data that relational databases
struggle with. They support modern application requirements like real-time analytics, cloud
computing, big data processing, and mobile/web applications. The term "NoSQL" does not
imply the absence of SQL but rather reflects the diversity of query languages and storage
mechanisms in these systems.

Unlike relational databases that store data in fixed tables with rows and columns, NoSQL

databases use a schema-less design, which allows developers to store data in more natural
and application-friendly formats. The most common types of NoSQL databases are key-value
stores, document-based, column-family, and graph databases. Each type addresses specific
needs; for example, key-value stores are great for caching, document databases for flexible
data structures, column stores for analytics, and graph databases for relationship-heavy
data.

NoSQL systems are particularly suited for distributed environments, offering horizontal
scalability—the ability to increase capacity by adding more servers. They often prioritize
availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency, following the CAP Theorem,
which states that in a distributed system, you can only fully achieve two out of the three:
Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Many NoSQL systems opt for eventual
consistency to ensure system uptime and fault tolerance.

In summary, NoSQL databases offer a powerful alternative to traditional databases in
scenarios that demand speed, scalability, and flexibility. They are not a replacement for
relational databases but rather a complementary solution, especially in systems that deal
with big data, real-time requirements, or variable data formats. Popular NoSQL systems
include MongoDB (document-based), Cassandra (column-based), Redis (key-value), and
Neo4j (graph-based), each tailored to specific application needs.

CAP Theorem — Detailed Notes

1. Introduction to CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem, also known as Brewer’s Theorem, is a fundamental principle in
distributed database systems. Proposed by Eric Brewer in 2000 and formally proved later, it
states that a distributed system can simultaneously provide only two out of the following
three guarantees:
