16.11 Modern Storage Architectures

Channel switch to connect multiple RAID systems, tape libraries, and so on to serv-
ers; and the use of Fiber Channel hubs and switches to connect servers and storage
systems in different configurations. Organizations can slowly move up from sim-
pler topologies to more complex ones by adding servers and storage devices as
needed. We do not provide further details here because they vary among SAN ven-
dors. The main advantages claimed include:

= Flexible many-to-many connectivity among servers and storage devices
using Fiber Channel hubs and switches

= Up to 10 km separation between a server and a storage system using appro-
priate fiber optic cables

= Better isolation capabilities allowing nondisruptive addition of new periph-
erals and servers

= High-speed data replication across multiple storage systems. Typical tech-
nologies use synchronous replication for local and asynchronous replication
for disaster recovery (DR) solutions.

SANs are growing very rapidly but are still faced with many problems, such as com-
bining storage options from multiple vendors and dealing with evolving standards
of storage management software and hardware. Most major companies are evaluat-
ing SANs as a viable option for database storage.

16.11.2 Network-Attached Storage

With the phenomenal growth in digital data, particularly generated from multi-
media and other enterprise applications, the need for high-performance storage
solutions at low cost has become extremely important. Network-attached storage
(NAS) devices are among the storage devices being used for this purpose. These
devices are, in fact, servers that do not provide any of the common server services,
but simply allow the addition of storage for file sharing. NAS devices allow vast
amounts of hard-disk storage space to be added to a network and can make that
space available to multiple servers without shutting them down for maintenance
and upgrades. NAS devices can reside anywhere on a local area network (LAN) and
may be combined in different configurations. A single hardware device, often called
the NAS box or NAS head, acts as the interface between the NAS system and net-
work clients. These NAS devices require no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. One or
more disk or tape drives can be attached to many NAS systems to increase total
capacity. Clients connect to the NAS head rather than to the individual storage
devices. A NAS can store any data that appears in the form of files, such as e-mail
boxes, Web content, remote system backups, and so on. In that sense, NAS devices
are being deployed as a replacement for traditional file servers.

NAS systems strive for reliable operation and easy administration. They include
built-in features such as secure authentication, or the automatic sending of e-mail
alerts in case of error on the device. The NAS devices (or appliances, as some ven-
dors refer to them) are being offered with a high degree of scalability, reliability,
