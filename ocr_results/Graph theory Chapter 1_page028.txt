Vertex degree and Handshaking pro

B xanple 8] Determine the order |V| of the 8raph G = (V; E) in the following cases :
(1) Gis a cubic graph with 9 edges,

(2) G is regular with 15 edges,
(3) G has 10 edges with 2 vertices of degree 4 and all other vertices of degree 3.

» (1) Suppose the order of G is n. Since G is a cubic

graph, all vertices of G have degree 3,
and therefore the sum of the degrees of vertices

is 3n. Since G has 9 edges, we should
have 3n = 2 x 9 (by the handshaking property) so that n = 6, Thus, the order of G is 6.

(2) Since G is regular, all vertices of G must be of the same degree, say k. If G is of order
n, then the sum of the degrees of vertices is kn. Since G has 15 edges, we should have
kn = 2 15 so that k = 30/n. Since k has to be a positive integer, it follows that n must
be a divisor of 30. Thus, the possible orders of G are 1,2, 3,5, 6, 10, 15 and 30.

(3) Suppose the order of G is n. Since two vertices of G are of degree 4 and all others are of
degree 3, the sum of the degrees of vertices of G is 2x4 + (n — 2) x 3. Since G has 10
edges, we should have 2 x 4 + (n — 2) x 3 = 2x 10. This gives n = 6. Thus, the order of
Gis 6. .

Z Example 9] Let G be a graph of order 9 such that each vertex has degree 5 or 6. Prove that
at least 5 vertices have degree 6 or atleast 6 vertices have degree 5.
> Let p be the number of vertices of G which have degree 5. Then the number of vertices of
G which have degree 6 is 9 — p = q (say). Evidently, 0 < p< 9,0< qs%

We note that the sum of the degrees of vertices of G is

(5 x p) + (6 x q) = 5p + 6(9 - p) = 54- p.

Since this sum has to be an even number, p cannot be odd. Thus, p = 0,2,4,6, or 8.
Consequently, the following possible cases arise :

p=0, q=9
p=2, q=7
p=4, q=5 ‘
p=6, q=3
p=8 q=l

We observe that in all the above possible cases either q 2 Sor p = 6. This means that
atleast 5 vertices have degree 6 or atleast 6 vertices have degree 5. s
