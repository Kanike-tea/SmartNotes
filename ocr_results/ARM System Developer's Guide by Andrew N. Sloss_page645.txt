632 Appendix A ARM and Thumb Assembler Instructions

Unlike the ARM assembler, you needn’t indent instructions and directives. Labels are
recognized by the following colon rather than their position at the start of the line. The
following example shows a simple assembly file defining a function add that returns the
sum of the two input arguments:

ssection .text,
«global add @ give the symbol add external linkage
add:

ADD v0, r0, rl @ add input arguments
MOV pc, Ir @ return from subroutine

A.5.1 GNU ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES

Here is an alphabetical list of the more common gas directives.

cascii "<string>"

Inserts the string as data into the assembly, as for DCB in armasm.

.asciz "<string>"

As for .ascii but follows the string with a zero byte.

-balign <power_of_2> {,<fill_value> {,<max_padding>} }

Aligns the address to <power_of_2> bytes. The assembler aligns by adding bytes of value
<fill_value> or a suitable default. The alignment will not occur if more than <max_padding>
fill bytes are required. Similar to ALIGN in armasm.

byte <bytel> {,<byte2>} ...

Inserts a list of byte values as data into the assembly, as for DCB in armasm.

.code <number_of_bits>

Sets the instruction width in bits. Use 16 for Thumb and 32 for ARM assembly. Similar to
CODE16 and CODE32 in armasm.

.else

Use with .if and .endif. Similar to ELSE in armasm.
