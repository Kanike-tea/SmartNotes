Rod Cells

Rod cells are photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye that are responsible for detecting light and
transmitting signals to the brain for the perception of vision, especially in low light conditions.
They contain a protein called rhodopsin that absorbs light and triggers a chain of events leading to
the activation of neural signals. Rods are more sensitive to light than cone cells but do not
distinguish color as well.

Cone Cells

Cone cells are photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye that are responsible for color vision and
visual acuity (sharpness of vision). There are three types of cone cells, each containing a different
photopigment sensitive to different wavelengths of light (red, green, and blue), which allow for
the perception of color. Cones are less sensitive to light than rod cells but provide better visual
acuity and color discrimination. They are concentrated in the fovea, the central part of the retina
responsible for detailed and sharp vision.

Architecture
Rod and cone cells have a similar basic structure, but there are some differences that are crucial
for their different functions.
