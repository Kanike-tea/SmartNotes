droplets come into contact with the leaf surface, they form near-perfect spheres and roll
off, collecting dirt and contaminants along the way. This is due to the combination of the
surface's low surface energy and the presence of micro/nanostructures, which reduce the
contact area and enable easy droplet mobility.

Micro/Nanostructured Surfaces: Surface texture plays a crucial role in self-cleaning
surfaces. Microscopic or nanoscopic structures can be engineered or naturally occurring
on a surface to create a roughness that limits the contact between the surface and
contaminants. These structures can trap air pockets, causing liquids to form droplets
with

reduced contact area, minimizing adhesion. The trapped air can act as a lubricant, aiding
in the easy removal of particles.

External Factors: While the surface properties contribute to self-cleaning, external
factors like water, wind, or light often play a role in activating the self-cleaning process.
For example, the presence of water, either through rainfall or manual washing, can help
remove loosely adhered particles from the surface. Sunlight or UV radiation can activate
photocatalytic reactions on certain surfaces, breaking down organic matter and
enhancing self-cleaning capabilities.

By combining low surface energy, micro/nanostructured surfaces, and external factors,

self-cleaning surfaces minimize the adhesion and retention of contaminants, making them easier
to clean or enabling them to self-clean when exposed to appropriate conditions

Materials and examples of self-cleaning surfaces

Self-cleaning surfaces are designed to minimize the adhesion of dirt, dust, and other

contaminants, making them easier to clean or allowing them to self-clean when exposed to
external forces like water or sunlight. Here are some materials and examples of self-cleaning
surfaces:

Photocatalytic Coatings: Photocatalytic materials, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), can
be used as coatings on surfaces to create self-cleaning properties. When exposed to
ultraviolet (UV) light, photocatalytic surfaces generate reactive oxygen species that
break down organic matter, resulting in the decomposition of dirt and pollutants.

Super hydrophobic Coatings: Super hydrophobic surfaces exhibit extremely high-water
repellency, which helps in the self-cleaning process. When water comes into contact
with these surfaces, it forms spherical droplets that easily roll off, carrying away dirt and
contaminants. Examples of super hydrophobic coatings include those made from
fluoropolymers, nanostructured surfaces, or combinations of hydrophobic materials.
Self-Cleaning Glass: Self-cleaning glass incorporates a thin layer of titanium dioxide
(TiO2) or other photocatalytic materials on the surface. When exposed to UV light, the
photocatalytic reaction breaks down organic matter, while the hydrophilic nature of the
surface allows water to spread and wash away the debris, resulting in a self-cleaning
effect.

Oleophobic Coatings: Oleophobic surfaces repel oil and grease, making them resistant
to stains and easier to clean. These coatings are typically made from fluorinated
materials that have low surface energy, preventing oil or oily substances from adhering
to the surface.

Micro/Nanostructured Surfaces: Surfaces with micro- or nanostructures can exhibit self-
cleaning properties due to their ability to reduce contact area and enhance surface
