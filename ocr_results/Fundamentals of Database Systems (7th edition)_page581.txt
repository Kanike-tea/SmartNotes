16.2 Secondary Storage Devices

reserved area in main storage that holds one disk block—is also provided. For a
read command, the disk block is copied into the buffer; whereas for a write com-
mand, the contents of the buffer are copied into the disk block. Sometimes several
contiguous blocks, called a cluster, may be transferred as a unit. In this case, the
buffer size is adjusted to match the number of bytes in the cluster.

The actual hardware mechanism that reads or writes a block is the disk read/write
head, which is part of a system called a disk drive. A disk or disk pack is mounted
in the disk drive, which includes a motor that rotates the disks. A read/write head
includes an electronic component attached to a mechanical arm. Disk packs with
multiple surfaces are controlled by several read/write heads—one for each surface,
as shown in Figure 16.1(b). All arms are connected to an actuator attached to
another electrical motor, which moves the read/write heads in unison and positions
them precisely over the cylinder of tracks specified in a block address.

Disk drives for hard disks rotate the disk pack continuously at a constant speed (typ-
ically ranging between 5,400 and 15,000 rpm). Once the read/write head is posi-
tioned on the right track and the block specified in the block address moves under
the read/write head, the electronic component of the read/write head is activated to
transfer the data. Some disk units have fixed read/write heads, with as many heads as
there are tracks. These are called fixed-head disks, whereas disk units with an actua-
tor are called movable-head disks. For fixed-head disks, a track or cylinder is
selected by electronically switching to the appropriate read/write head rather than by
actual mechanical movement; consequently, it is much faster. However, the cost of
the additional read/write heads is high, so fixed-head disks are not commonly used.

Interfacing Disk Drives to Computer Systems. A disk controller, typically
embedded in the disk drive, controls the disk drive and interfaces it to the computer
system. One of the standard interfaces used for disk drives on PCs and workstations
was called SCSI (small computer system interface). Today to connect HDDs, CDs, and
DVDs to a computer, the interface of choice is SATA. SATA stands for serial ATA,
wherein ATA represents attachment; so SATA becomes serial AT attachment. It has
its origin in PC/AT attachment, which referred to the direct attachment to the 16-bit
bus introduced by IBM. The AT referred to advanced technology but is not used in the
expansion of SATA due to trademark issues. Another popular interface used today is
called SAS (serial attached SCSI). SATA was introduced in 2002 and allows the disk
controller to be in the disk drive; only a simple circuit is required on the motherboard.
SATA transfer speeds underwent an evolution from 2002 to 2008, going from 1.5 Gbps
(gigabits per second) to 6 Gbps. SATA is now called NL-SAS for nearline SAS. The
largest 3.5-inch SATA and SAS drives are 8TB, whereas 2.5-inch SAS drives are smaller
and go up to 1.2TB. The 3.5-inch drives use 7,200 or 10,000 rpm speed whereas
2.5-inch drives use up to 15,000 rpm. In terms of IOPs (input/output operations) per
second as a price to performance index, SAS is considered superior to SATA.

The controller accepts high-level I/O commands and takes appropriate action to
position the arm and causes the read/write action to take place. To transfer a disk
block, given its address, the disk controller must first mechanically position the
