e Large surface area: Cellulose-based water filters have a large surface area, which

enhancestheir filtration capabilities and reduces the frequency of filter replacement.

Limitations of cellulose-based water filters

Cellulose-based water filters have some limitations that need to be considered when

choosing a water filtration solution:

e Low resistance to high temperature: Cellulose-based water filters have low resistance
to hightemperature and can lose their structural integrity when exposed to high
temperatures.

e Low filtration efficiency for certain contaminants: Cellulose-based water filters may
not beefficient in removing certain contaminants, such as heavy metals, from water.

e Limited lifespan: Cellulose-based water filters have a limited lifespan and may need to
bereplaced more frequently compared to synthetic polymer filters.

e Difficult to sterilize: Cellulose-based water filters may be difficult to sterilize
effectively increasing the risk of contamination.

e May clog easily: Cellulose-based water filters may clog easily when exposed to high
levels of contaminants, reducing their filtration efficiency and requiring frequent
replacement.

e May affect water taste: Cellulose-based water filters may affect the taste of water by
absorbing or releasing certain chemicals or minerals, reducing the quality of the purified

water.

PHA as Bioplastic

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a class of biodegradable and biocompatible
polyesters produced by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. They are a type of

bioplastic. They are made from renewable resources, such as sugar and cornstarch, and are
