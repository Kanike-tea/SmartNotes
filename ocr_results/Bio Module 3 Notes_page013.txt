membrane potential. The inner segment contains the cell's organelles, including the nucleus and
mitochondria.

The major difference between rod and cone cells is their shape. Rod cells are elongated
and cylindrical, while cone cells are shorter and more conical in shape. This difference in shape
affects the distribution of photopigments and the number of synaptic contacts with bipolar and
ganglion cells, which transmit the signals to the brain. Rod cells have a single long outer segment,
while cone cells have several shorter segments.

Another difference between the two types of cells is the distribution of their synaptic
contacts with bipolar cells. Rod cells make synapses with one bipolar cell, while cone cells synapse
with one of several bipolar cells. This difference in synapse distribution is critical for the different
functions of rod and cone cells in vision.

Optical Corrections
Optical corrections refer to devices or techniques used to improve or correct vision
problems caused by a refractive error in the eye. Refractive errors occur when light entering the
eye is not properly focused on the retina, leading to blurred vision. There are several types of
refractive errors, including:
e Myopia (nearsightedness): Light is focused in front of the retina, making distant objects
appear blurry.
e Hyperopia (farsightedness): Light is focused behind the retina, making near objects appear
blurry.
e Astigmatism: Light is not focused evenly on the retina, leading to blurred or distorted
vision.
The most common optical corrections include:
1. Eyeglasses: Glasses with corrective lenses can be used to refocus light onto the retina,
improving vision.
2. Contact lenses: Corrective lenses in the form of contacts sit directly on the cornea and
work similarly to eyeglasses.
3. Refractive surgery: Surgical procedures, such as LASIK and PRK, can reshape the cornea
to correct refractive errors.
Optical corrections can greatly improve visual acuity and quality of life for people with
refractive errors. However, it is important to have regular eye exams to determine the appropriate
correction and monitor eye health.
