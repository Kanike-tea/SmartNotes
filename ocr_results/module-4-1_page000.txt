MODULE 4: TREES

DEFINITION

A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that

There is a specially designated node called root.
The remaining nodes are partitioned into n >= 0 disjoint set Ti,...,T,, where each of
these sets is a tree. T),...,Tn are called the subtrees of the root.

Every node in the tree is the root of some subtree

TERMINOLOGY

Node: The item of information plus the branches to other nodes

Degree: The number of subtrees of a node

Degree of a tree: The maximum of the degree of the nodes in the tree.

Terminal nodes (or leaf): nodes that have degree zero or node with no successor
Nonterminal nodes: nodes that don’t belong to terminal nodes.

Parent and Children: Suppose N is a node in T with left successor S1 and right
successor 82, then N is called the Parent (or father) of S1 and S2. Here, S1 is called
left child (or Son) and S2 is called right child (or Son) of N.

Siblings: Children of the same parent are said to be siblings.

Edge: A line drawn from node N ofa T to a successor is called an edge

Path: A sequence of consecutive edges from node N to a node M is called a path.
Ancestors of a node: All the nodes along the path from the root to that node.

The level of a node: defined by letting the root be at level zero. If a node is at level 1,
then it children are at level 1+1.

Height (or depth): The maximum level of any node in the tree
