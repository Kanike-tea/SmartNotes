Initial version of padd function

+ Ifa is of type ‘polynomial’ then A(x)= )ai x' can be represented as:
a.degree=n
a.coeff[i]=an-i
+ In this representation, we store coefficients in order of decreasing exponents, such that
a.coef[i] is the coefficient of x"' provided a term with exponent n-i exis

a.coeff[iJ=0

s; otherwise,
