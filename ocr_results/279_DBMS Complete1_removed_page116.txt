(recovery transparency).

Performance transparency mandates that the DDBMS should have a comparable level of
performance to a centralized DBMS. Query optimizers can be used to speed up response time.

Advantages of DDBMS's

- Reflects organizational structure

- Improved share ability

- Improved availability

- Improved reliability

- Improved performance

- Data are located nearest the greatest demand site and are dispersed to match business
requirements.

- Faster Data Access because users only work with a locally stored subset of the data.

- Faster data processing because the data is processed at several different sites.

-Growth Facilitation: New sites can be added without compromising the operations of other sites.
-Improved communications because local sites are smaller and closer to customers.

- Reduced operating costs: It is more cost-effective to add workstations to a network rather than
update a mainframe system.

- User Friendly interface equipped with an easy-to-use GUI.

- Less instances of single-point failure because data and workload are distributed among other
workstations.

- Processor independence: The end user is able to access any available copy of data.

Disadvantages of DDBMS

- Increased Cost

-Integrity control more difficult,

-Lack of standards,

-Database design more complex.

- Complexity of management and control. Applications must recognize data location and they must
be able to stitch together data from various sites.

- Technologically difficult: Data integrity, transaction management, concurrency control, security,
backup, recovery, query optimization, access path selection are all issues that must be addressed
and resolved

- Security lapses have increased instances when data are in multiple locations.

- Lack of standards due to the absence of communication protocols can make the processing and
distribution of data difficult.

- Increased storage and infrastructure requirements because multiple copies of data are required at
various separate locations which would require more disk space.

- Increased costs due to the higher complexity of training.

- Requires duplicate infrastructure (personnel, software and __ licensing, _ physical
location/environment) and these can sometimes offset any operational savings.
