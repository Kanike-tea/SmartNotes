462 Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases

In general, the easier it is to explain the semantics of the relation—or in other words,
what a relation exactly means and stands for—the better the relation schema design
will be. To illustrate this, consider Figure 14.1, a simplified version of the COMPANY
relational database schema in Figure 5.5, and Figure 14.2, which presents an example
of populated relation states of this schema. The meaning of the EMPLOYEE relation
schema is simple: Each tuple represents an employee, with values for the employee’s
name (Ename), Social Security number (Ssn), birth date (Bdate), and address
(Address), and the number of the department that the employee works for (Dnumber).
The Dnumber attribute is a foreign key that represents an implicit relationship between
EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT. The semantics of the DEPARTMENT and PROJECT
schemas are also straightforward: Each DEPARTMENT tuple represents a department
entity, and each PROJECT tuple represents a project entity. The attribute Dmgr_ssn of
DEPARTMENT relates a department to the employee who is its manager, whereas
Dnum of PROJECT relates a project to its controlling department; both are foreign key
attributes. The ease with which the meaning ofa relation’s attributes can be explained
is an informal measure of how well the relation is designed.
