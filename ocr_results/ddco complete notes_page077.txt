4.PC (PROGRAM COUNTER)
> Itis a special purpose register used to hold the address of the next instruction to be
executed.
> The contents of PC are incremented by 1 or 2 or 4, during the execution of current
instruction.
> The contents of PC are incremented by 1| for 8 bit CPU, 2 for 16 bit CPU and for 4 for 32
bit CPU.

4. GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTER / REGISTER ARRAY
The structure of register file is as shown in the figure

Ro
Ri
R2
Rn-t
. It consists of set of registers.
a A register is defined as group of flip flops. Each,flip flop is designed to store 1 bit of
data.
. It is a storage element.
. It is used to store the data temporarily during the execution of the program(eg: result).
. It can be used as a pointer to Memory.

. The Register size depends on the processing speed of the CPU
. EX: Register size = 8 bits for 8 bit CPU.

5. IR (INSTRUCTION REGISTER
It holds the instruction to be executed. It notifies the control unit, which generates timing
signals that controls various operations in the execution of that instruction.

6. ALU (ARITHMETIC and LOGIC UNIT)
. It performs arithmetic and logical operations on given data.

Steps for reading the instruction.

PC contents are transferred to MAR and read signal is sent to memory by control unit.
The data from memory location is read and sent to MDR.

The content of MDR is moved to IR.

[PC] > MAR ————_+ Memory > MDR > IR
CU ( read signal)
