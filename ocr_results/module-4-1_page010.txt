BINARY TREE TRAVERSALS
Visiting each node in a tree exactly once is called tree traversal

The different methods of traversing a binary tree are:
Preorder

Inorder

Postorder

Iterative inorder Traversal

Level-Order traversal

1. Inorder: Inorder traversal calls for moving down the tree toward the left until you cannot go
further. Then visit the node, move one node to the right and continue. If no move can be done,
then go back one more node.

Let ptr is the pointer which contains the location of the node N currently being scanned.
L(N) denotes the leftchild of node N and R(N) is the right child of node N

Recursion function:
The inorder traversal of a binary tree can be recursively defined as

e Traverse the left subtree in inorder.
e Visit the root.
e Traverse the right subtree in inorder.

void inorder(treepointerptr)
{
if (ptr)
{
inorder (ptr—leftchild);
printf (“%d’,ptr—data) ;
inorder (ptr—rightchild);
