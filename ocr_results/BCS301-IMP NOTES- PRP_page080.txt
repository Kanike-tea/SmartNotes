Since Fo < Fr we accept null hypothesis at 5% level of significance and conclude that the two
samples may be regarded as drawn from the populations having same variance.

24. The table shows the standard Deviation and Sample Standard Deviation for both men and
women. Find the f statistic considering the Men population in numerator.
Population Population Standard Sample Standard
Deviation Deviation
Men 30 35
Women 50 45
Given,

o,=Standard deviation of population-1=30
02=Standard deviation of population-2=50
S,=Standard deviation of sample-1=35
S2=Standard deviation of sample-2=45

We know that,
