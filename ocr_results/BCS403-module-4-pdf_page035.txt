Figure: State transition diagram illustrating the states for transaction, execution

A transaction goes into active state immediately after it starts execution and can

execute read and write operations.

When the transaction ends it moves to partially committed state.

At this end additional checks are done to see if the transaction can be committed or not.
If these checks are successful the transaction is said to have reached commit point and
enters committed state. All the changes are recorded permanently in the db.

A transaction can go to the failed state if one of the checks fails or if the transaction is
aborted during its active state. The transaction may then have to be rolled back to undo
the effect of its write operation.

Terminated state corresponds to the transaction leaving the system. All the information

about the transaction is removed from system tables.

5.3.2 Thélsystem Log

Log or Journal keeps track of all transaction operations that affect the values of
database items

This information may be needed to permit recovery from transaction failures.

The log is kept on disk, so it is not affected by any type of failure except for disk or
catastrophic failure

one (or more) main memory buffers hold the last part of the log file, so that log entries
are first added to the main memory buffer

When the log buffer is filled, or when certain other conditions occur, the log buffer is

appended to the end of the log file on disk.
