Chapter 15 Relational Database Design Algorithms and Further Dependencies

Some of the additional functional dependencies that we can infer from F are the
following:

Ssn — {Dname, Dmgr_ssn}
Ssn > Ssn
Dnumber — Dname

The closure F* of F is the set of all functional dependencies that can be inferred
from F. To determine a systematic way to infer dependencies, we must discover a
set of inference rules that can be used to infer new dependencies from a given set of
dependencies. We consider some of these inference rules next. We use the notation
F|=X > Y to denote that the functional dependency X — Y is inferred from the set
of functional dependencies F.

In the following discussion, we use an abbreviated notation when discussing func-
tional dependencies. We concatenate attribute variables and drop the commas
for convenience. Hence, the FD {X,Y} — Z is abbreviated to XY — Z, and the
FD {X, Y, Z} > {U, V} is abbreviated to XYZ — UV. We present below three rules
IR1 through IRS that are well-known inference rules for functional dependencies.
They were proposed first by Armstrong (1974) and hence are known as
Armstrong’s axioms.!

IR1 (reflexive rule): If XD Y, then X >Y.
IR2 (augmentation rule)*: {X > Y} |=XZ > YZ.
IRS (transitive rule): {X > Y, Y > Z} |=X > Z.

Armstrong has shown that inference rules IR1 through IR3 are sound and complete.
By sound, we mean that given a set of functional dependencies F specified on a rela-
tion schema R, any dependency that we can infer from F by using IR1 through IR3
holds in every relation state r of R that satisfies the dependencies in F. By complete,
we mean that using IR1 through IR3 repeatedly to infer dependencies until no more
dependencies can be inferred results in the complete set of all possible dependencies
that can be inferred from F. In other words, the set of dependencies F*, which we
called the closure of F, can be determined from F by using only inference rules IR1
through IR3.

The reflexive rule (IR1) states that a set of attributes always determines itself or any of its
subsets, which is obvious. Because IR1 generates dependencies that are always true, such
dependencies are called trivial. Formally, a functional dependency X — Y is trivial if
X 2 Y; otherwise, it is nontrivial. The augmentation rule (IR2) says that adding the
same set of attributes to both the left- and right-hand sides of a dependency results in
another valid dependency. According to IR3, functional dependencies are transitive.

'They are actually inference rules rather than axioms. In the strict mathematical sense, the axioms (given
facts) are the functional dependencies in F, since we assume that they are correct, whereas IR1 through
IR3 are the inference rules for inferring new functional dependencies (new facts).

The reflexive rule can also be stated as X > X; that is, any set of attributes functionally determines itself.

3The augmentation rule can also be stated as X—» Y[= XZ Y; that is, augmenting the left-hand-side
attributes of an FD produces another valid FD.
