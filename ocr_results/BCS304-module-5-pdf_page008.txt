2. Collisions increases as data size grows.

2. Dynamic Hashing:

Dynamically increases the size of the hash table as collision occurs. There are two types:

1) Dynamic hashing using directory or (Extendible hashing) : uses a directory that grows or shrinks
depending on the data distribution. No overflow buckets

2) Directory less Dynamic hashing or (Linear hashing): No directory. Splits buckets in linear order,
uses overflow buckets.

Dynamic hashing using directory

¢ Uses a directory of pointers to buckets/bins which are collections of records
¢ The number of buckets are doubled by doubling the directory, and splitting just the
bin that overflowed.

¢ Directory much smaller than file, so doubling it is much cheaper.
