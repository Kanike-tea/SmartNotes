> A Boolean function expresses the logical relationship between binary

variables and is evaluated by determining the binary value of the expression
for all possible values of the variables.

> A Boolean function can be represented in a truth table. The number of
rows in the truth table is 2n, where n is the number of variables in the
function.

> Table 1 shown below represents the truth table for the function F1. There are
eight possible binary combinations for assigning bits to the three variables x,
y, and z.

> The table shows that the function is equal to 1 when x = 1 or when yz = 01
and is equal to 0 otherwise.

> A Boolean function can be transformed from an algebraic expression into a
circuit diagram composed of logic gates connected in a particular structure.

o The logic-circuit diagram for F1 is shown in Fig. 2.1. There is an inverter for

input y to generate its complement. There is an AND gate for the term y'z

and an OR gate that combines x with y'z.

Gate implementation of F, = x + y'z

Consider, for example, the following Boolean function:F2 = x'y'z + x'yz + xy'
> Aschematic of an implementation of this function with logic gates is shown
in Fig. 2.2(a).
> Input variables x and y are complemented with inverters to obtain x' and y'. The
three terms in the expression are implemented with three AND gates. The OR
