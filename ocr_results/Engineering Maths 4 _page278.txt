Probability Distributions
Tntroduction and Preamble’

In our normal conversations we make statements like ‘I am likely to be out of station’,
T have a good chance of being selected to the job’ etc. In such statements we are not
sure of the outcome but we intend to estimate the chances of our statments being true.

Probablity gives an insight for such things in a mathematical way.
© Definitions .

Exhaustive event : An event consisting of all the various possibilities is called an
exhaustive event...

Mutually exclusive events: Two or more évents are said to be mutually exclusive if
the happening of one event prevent the simultaneous happening of the others.

Examples

1. In tossing a coin, getting head and ‘tail are mutually exclusive inview of the fact
that if head is the turn out, getting tail is not possible.

2, In throwing a cubical ‘die’, getting any of the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are mutually
exclusive as the turn out of any number rules out the possibility of the turn out of
other numbers. |

‘Independent events ; Twoormoreeventsare said tobe independent if the happening
‘or nonhappening of one event does not prevent the happening or.non happening of

the others. -
Examples

1, When two coins are tossed the event of getting head isan independent event as
both the coins can turn out heads. :

2, When acard is drawn atrandom froma pack of 52 cards and if thie card is replaced,
the result of the second draw is independent of the first. But if the card is not
replaced then the résult of the second depends on the result of the first draw.

Mathematical (priori) definition of probability; If the outcome ofa trial consists 1
exhaustive, mutually exclusive, equally possible cases, of which m of them are
