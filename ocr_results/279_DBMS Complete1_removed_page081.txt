FD Axioms

Understanding: Functional Dependencies are recognized by analysis of the real world; no
automation or algorithm. Finding or recognizing them are the database designer's task.

FD manipulations:

¢ Soundness -- no incorrect FD's are generated
¢ Completeness -- all FD's can be generated

Example

if a is set of attributes, b € a,

ivi SSN, Ne SSN
Reflexivity then a —>b lame >
A tati ifa— b holds and c is a set of | |SSN — Name then
ugmentation attributes, then ca cb 'SSN,Phone — Name, Phone
Transitivity ifa —b holds and bc holds, cox) 7: and Zip + City then SSN City

then a— c holds

Union or Additivity
*

ifa— banda-—c holds then
a— be holds

'SSN—Name and SSN—Zip then SSN—Name,Zip

Decomposition or
Projectivity*

ifa — be holds then a > b
and a — c holds

'SSN—Name,Zip then SYN--Name and SSN>Zip

Pseudotransitivity*

ifa — b and cb > d hold then
ac — d holds

Address — Project and Project, Date Amount then
Address, Date + Amount

(NOTE)

ab— c does NOT imply a— c

andb—c
