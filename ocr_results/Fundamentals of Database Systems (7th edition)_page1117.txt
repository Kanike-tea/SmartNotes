U(syj, ---» Sj) can be defined using the formulation for I(s;, ... , s,) with p; being replaced
by pi where p;j=sj/s. Now the information gain by partitioning on attribute A, Gain(A),
is defined as I(sj, ..., s,) — E(A). We can use the sample training data from Fig-
ure 28.6 to illustrate the algorithm.

The attribute RID represents the record identifier used for identifying an individual
record and is an internal attribute. We use it to identify a particular record in our
example. First, we compute the expected information needed to classify the training
data of 6 records as I(s;, s3) where there are two classes: the first class label value
corresponds to yes and the second to no. So

1(3,3) = — 0.5og, 0.5 ~ 0.5log, 0.5 = 1

Now, we compute the entropy for each of the four attributes as shown below. For
Married = yes, we have $1 = 2, s3; = 1 and I(s,1, $21) = 0.92. For Married = no, we have
$12 = 1, 822 =2 and (519, 822) = 0.92. So the expected information needed to classify a
sample using attribute Married as the partitioning attribute is

E(Martied) = 3/6 I(s;, $21) + 3/6 I(s135 $2) = 0.92

The gain in information, Gain(Married), would be 1 — 0.92 = 0.08. If we follow simi-
lar steps for computing the gain with respect to the other three attributes we end up
with

E(Salary) = 0.33 and Gain(Salary) = 0.67
E(Acct_balance) = 0.92 and Gain(Acct_balance) = 0.08
E(Age) = 0.54 and Gain(Age) = 0.46

Since the greatest gain occurs for attribute Salary, it is chosen as the partitioning
attribute. The root of the tree is created with label Salary and has three branches,
one for each value of Salary. For two of the three values, that is, < 20K and > 50K, all
the samples that are partitioned accordingly (records with RIDs 4 and 5 for < 20K
and records with RIDs 1 and 2 for > 50K) fall within the same class loanworthy no
and loanworthy yes, respectively, for those two values. So we create a leaf node for
each. The only branch that needs to be expanded is for the value 20K ... 50K with
two samples, records with RIDs 3 and 6 in the training data. Continuing the process
using these two records, we find that Gain(Married) is 0, Gain(Acct_balance) is 1, and
Gain(Age) is 1.
