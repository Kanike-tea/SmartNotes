Gates:

“A digital circuit having one or more input signals but only one output signal is called a
gate”.

Logic Gates:
“The gates which perform logical operation is called logic gates”.
. It take binary input and gives binary outputs.

. The output of the logic gates can be understood using truth table, which contains
inputs, outputs of logic circuits.

Logic gates are electronic circuits that operate on one or more input signals to produce
an output signal.

The timing diagrams iuusuaw uw iucauzcu icopuuse of each gate to the four input
signal combinations. The horizontal axis of the timing diagram represents the time,

and the vertical axis shows the signal as it changes between the two possible voltage
levels.

The low level represents logic 0, the high level logic 1.
The AND gate responds with a logic 1 output signal when both input signals are logic 1.
The OR gate responds with a logic 1 output signal if any input signal is logic 1.

The NOT gate is commonly referred to as an inverter. The output signal inverts the
logic sense of the input signal.
