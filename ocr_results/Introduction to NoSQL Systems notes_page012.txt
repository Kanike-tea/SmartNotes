« Complex Setup and Maintenance: Requires tuning for replication, consistency
levels, partitioning, etc.

e Limited Ad-Hoc Querying: Lacks the full flexibility of SQL; data must be modeled
based on expected query patterns.

« Eventual Consistency: Some systems (like Cassandra) use eventual consistency,
which may not suit all use cases.

e Harder Learning Curve: Data modeling is non-traditional and requires
understanding of partitioning, clustering, and denormalization strategies.

8. Summary

Wide-column or column-family NoSQL databases provide a powerful alternative to
relational systems for applications that require scalable, high-throughput access to large,
sparse datasets. With their schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, and performance
optimizations, they are an excellent choice for analytics, time-series data, and big data
platforms. Technologies like Cassandra, HBase, and Bigtable continue to drive mission-
critical workloads across various industries by delivering performance and reliability at
massive scale.

NoSQL Graph Databases

Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database designed to represent and manage data
with complex relationships. They store data in the form of nodes (entities) and edges
(relationships), with properties attached to both. This model is highly intuitive for
applications where connections between data are as important as the data itself. Unlike
relational databases that require complex joins to represent relationships, graph databases
allow for fast and direct traversal between connected entities, making them ideal for
scenarios like social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and network
analysis.

In graph databases, queries typically focus on patterns of relationships rather than tabular
joins. For example, finding "friends of friends" in a social network or suggesting products
based on shared purchases becomes much simpler and faster in a graph model. The schema
is flexible and can evolve easily, which is useful for growing datasets with changing
structures.
