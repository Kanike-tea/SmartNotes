1.3 Characteristics of the Database Approach

banking database, or a company database—as long as the database definition is
stored in the catalog.

In traditional file processing, data definition is typically part of the application pro-
grams themselves. Hence, these programs are constrained to work with only one
specific database, whose structure is declared in the application programs. For
example, an application program written in C++ may have struct or class declara-
tions. Whereas file-processing software can access only specific databases, DBMS
software can access diverse databases by extracting the database definitions from
the catalog and using these definitions.

For the example shown in Figure 1.2, the DBMS catalog will store the definitions of
all the files shown. Figure 1.3 shows some entries in a database catalog. Whenever a
request is made to access, say, the Name of a STUDENT record, the DBMS software
refers to the catalog to determine the structure of the STUDENT file and the position
and size of the Name data item within a STUDENT record. By contrast, in a typical
file-processing application, the file structure and, in the extreme case, the exact
location of Name within a STUDENT record are already coded within each program
that accesses this data item.
