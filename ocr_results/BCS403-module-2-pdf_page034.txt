JOIN result. Tuples with NULL values in the join attributes are also eliminated.This type of join,
where tuples with no match are eliminated, is known as an inner join.

A set of operations, called outer joins, were developed for the case where the user wants to keep
all the tuples in R, or all those in S, or all those in both relations in the result of the JOIN,

regardless of whether or not they have matching tuples in the other relation.

For example, suppose that we want a list of all employee names as well as the name of the
departments they manage if they happen to manage a department; if they do not manage one, we

can indicate it with a NULL value. We can apply an operation LEFT OUTER JOIN, denoted by

Boa

to retrieve the result as follows:

TEMP < (EMPLOYEE )<.._ DEPARTMENT)

Magr_sen
RESULT & Trname, Minit, Lname, Dame TEMP)

The LEFT OUTER JOIN operation keeps every tuple in the first, or left, relation R in
R_ >q_ S; if no matching tuple is found in S, then the attributes of S in the join result are
filled or padded with NULL values.

A similar operation, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, denoted by [pf _ keeps every tuple in the second,
3
or right, relation S inthe result of R re ; S.

A third operation, FULL OUTER JOIN, denoted by }*{ , keeps all tuples in both the left
and the right relations when no matching tuples are found, padding them with NULL values as
needed.

2.5.5 The OUTER UNION Operation

The OUTER UNION operation was developed to take the union of tuples from two relations

that have some common attributes, but are not union (type) compatible.This operation will take
