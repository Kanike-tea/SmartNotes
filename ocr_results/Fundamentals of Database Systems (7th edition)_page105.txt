3.4 Relationship Types, Relationship Sets, Roles, and Structural Constraints 75

Role Names and Recursive Relationships. Each entity type that participates
ina relationship type plays a particular role in the relationship. The role name sig-
nifies the role that a participating entity from the entity type plays in each relation-
ship instance, and it helps to explain what the relationship means. For example, in
the WORKS _FOR relationship type, EMPLOYEE plays the role of employee or worker
and DEPARTMENT plays the role of department or employer.

Role names are not technically necessary in relationship types where all the partici-
pating entity types are distinct, since each participating entity type name can be used
as the role name. However, in some cases the same entity type participates more than
once in a relationship type in different roles. In such cases the role name becomes
essential for distinguishing the meaning of the role that each participating entity
plays. Such relationship types are called recursive relationships or self-referencing
relationships. Figure 3.11 shows an example. The SUPERVISION relationship type
relates an employee to a supervisor, where both employee and supervisor entities are
members of the same EMPLOYEE entity set. Hence, the EMPLOYEE entity type
participates twice in SUPERVISION: once in the role of supervisor (or boss), and
once in the role of supervisee (or subordinate). Each relationship instance r; in
SUPERVISION associates two different employee entities e; and e, one of which
plays the role of supervisor and the other the role of supervise. In Figure 3.11, the
lines marked ‘1’ represent the supervisor role, and those marked ‘2’ represent the
supervisee role; hence, e; supervises e) and e3, e4 supervises eg and e7, and es super-
vises e; and e4. In this example, each relationship instance must be connected with
two lines, one marked with ‘1’ (supervisor) and the other with ‘2’ (supervise).
