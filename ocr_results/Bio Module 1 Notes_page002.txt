Cells are the fundamental unit of life. They range in size from 0.0001 mm to nearly 150

Types of Cells:

Cells are similar to factories with different labourers and departments that work towards a

common objective. Various types of cells perform different functions. Based on cellular

Prokaryotes

2. Eukaryotes

Prokaryotic Cells

Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus. Instead, some prokaryotes such as bacteria have a
region within the cell where the genetic material is freely suspended. This region is

called the nucleoid.

They all are single-celled microorganisms. Examples include archaea, bacteria, and

cyanobacteria.
The cell size ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 wm in diameter.
The hereditary material can either be DNA or RNA.

Prokaryotes generally reproduce by binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction.
They are also known to use conjugation — which is often seen as the prokaryotic

equivalent to sexual reproduction (however, it is NOT sexual reproduction).

Eukaryotic Cells

Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a true nucleus.
