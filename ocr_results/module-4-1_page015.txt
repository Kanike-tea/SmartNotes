Data Structures and Applications (15CS33)

The inorder traversal of this tree is

X1 A 7X2 V 7X1 A X3 V 4X3,

The algorithm to determine satisfiablity is to let (x1, x2, x3) takes on all the possible
combination of true and false values to check the formula for each combination.

For n value of an expression, there are 2" possible combinations of true and false

For example n=3, the eight combinations are (t,t.t), (t.t,f), (tft), (Lf), (fo. (ff), fo,
(fff).

The algorithm will take O(g 2"), where g is the time to substitute values for x1, x2,... Xn and
evaluate the expression.

Node structure:
For the purpose of evaluation algorithm, assume each node has four fields:
left—child ht—child |

Figure : Node structure for the satisfiability problem

data | value | rig

Define this node structure in C as:

typedef enum {not,and,or,true,false} logical;
typedef struct node *tree—pointer;
typedef struct node {

tree-pointer left—child;

logical data;

short int value;

tree—pointer right—child;

}G

Satisfiability function: The first version of Satisfiability algorithm

for (all 2" possible combinations) {
generate the next combination;
replace the variables by their values;
evaluate root by traversing it in postorder;
if (rootvalue) {
printf (<combination>);
return;

}
printf("No satisfiable combination\n");
