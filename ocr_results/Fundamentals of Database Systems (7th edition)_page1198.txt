1168 Appendix B Parameters of Disks

3. Block transfer time (btt). Once the read/write head is at the beginning of
the required block, some time is needed to transfer the data in the block.
This block transfer time depends on the block size, track size, and rotational
speed. If the transfer rate for the disk is tr bytes/msec and the block size is
B bytes, then

btt = B/tr msec

If we have a track size of 50 Kbytes and p is 3600 rpm, then the transfer rate
in bytes/msec is

tr = (50 + 1000)/(60 + 1000/3600) = 3000 bytes/msec
In this case, btt = B/3000 msec, where B is the block size in bytes.

The average time (s) needed to find and transfer a block, given its block address, is
estimated by

(s+ rd + btt) msec

This holds for either reading or writing a block. The principal method of reducing
this time is to transfer several blocks that are stored on one or more tracks of the
same cylinder; then the seek time is required for the first block only. To transfer
consecutively k noncontiguous blocks that are on the same cylinder, we need
approximately

s+(k* (rd + btt)) msec

In this case, we need two or more buffers in main storage because we are continu-
ously reading or writing the k blocks, as we discussed in Chapter 17. The transfer
time per block is reduced even further when consecutive blocks on the same track or
cylinder are transferred. This eliminates the rotational delay for all but the first
block, so the estimate for transferring k consecutive blocks is

s+rd+ (k* btt) msec

A more accurate estimate for transferring consecutive blocks takes into account the
interblock gap (see Section 17.2.1), which includes the information that enables the
read/write head to determine which block it is about to read. Usually, the disk man-
ufacturer provides a bulk transfer rate (btr) that takes the gap size into account
when reading consecutively stored blocks. If the gap size is G bytes, then

btr = (B/(B + G)) * tr bytes/msec

The bulk transfer rate is the rate of transferring useful bytes in the data blocks. The
disk read/write head must go over all bytes on a track as the disk rotates, including
the bytes in the interblock gaps, which store control information but not real data.
When the bulk transfer rate is used, the time needed to transfer the useful data in
one block out of several consecutive blocks is B/btr. Hence, the estimated time to
read k blocks consecutively stored on the same cylinder becomes

st+rd+ (k* (B/btr)) msec
