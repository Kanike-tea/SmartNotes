FROM EMPLOYEE AS E

WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *

FROM DEPENDENT AS D

WHERE E.Ssn=D.Essn AND E.Sex=D.Sex

AND E.Fname=D.Dependent_name);
Example: List the names of managers who have at least one dependent

SELECT Fname, Lname

FROM EMPLOYEE

WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *

FROM DEPENDENT

WHERE Ssn=Essn )

AND

EXISTS ( SELECT *

FROM DEPARTMENT

WHERE Ssn=Mgr_ssn );

In general, EXISTS(Q) returns TRUE if there is at least one tuple in the result of the nested query Q,
and it returns FALSE otherwise.

NOT EXISTS Functions
NOT EXISTS(Q) returns TRUE if there are no tuples in the result of nested query Q, and it returns
FALSE otherwise.
Example: Retrieve the names of employees who have no dependents.
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT *
FROM DEPENDENT
WHERE Ssn=Essn );

For each EMPLOYEE tuple, the correlated nested query selects all DEPENDENT tuples whose
Essn value matches the EMPLOYEE Ssn; if the result is empty, no dependents are related to the
employee, so we select that EMPLOYEE tuple and retrieve its Fname and Lname.

Example: Retrieve the name of each employee who works on all the projects controlled
by department number 5
SELECT Fname, Lname
