DATA STRUCTURES-BCS304 MODULE 1

ANALYSIS
* In worst case, the realloc function needs to
— allocate 2*capacity*sizeof(*stack) bytes of memory and
— copy capacity*sizeof(*stack) bytes of memory from the old array into the new one.
+ The total time spent over all array doublings = O(2k ) where capacity=2k
+ Since the total number of pushes is more than 2k-1 , the total time spend in array doubling
is O(n) where n=total number of pushes.
STACK APPLICATIONS: POLISH NOTATION
Expressions: It is sequence of operators and operands that reduces to a single value after

evaluation is called an expression.

X=a/b-c+d*e-a*ce
In above expression contains operators (+, —, /, *) operands (a, b, ¢, d, e).

Expression can be represented in in different format _such_as

e Prefix Expression or Polish notation
e Infix Expression
e Postfix Expression or Reverse Polish notation
e Infix Expression: In this expression, the binary operator is placed in-between the
operand. The expression can be parenthesized or un- parenthesized.
Example: A+ B
Here, A & B are operands and + is operand
e Prefix _or Polish Expression: In this expression, the operator appears before its
operand.
Example: + A B
Here, A & B are operands and + is operand
e Postfix or Reverse Polish Expression: In this expression, the operator appears
after its operand.
Example: AB +

Here, A & B are operands and + is operand
