16 Chapter 1 ARM Embedded Systems

= It improves code density and performance by conditionally executing instructions.

= It includes enhanced instructions to perform digital signal processing type functions.

‘An embedded system includes the following hardware components: ARM processors
are found embedded in chips. Programmers access peripherals through memory-mapped
registers. There is a special type of peripheral called a controller, which embedded systems
use to configure higher-level functions such as memory and interrupts. The AMBA on-chip
bus is used to connect the processor and peripherals together.

An embedded system also includes the following software components: Initialization
code configures the hardware to a known state. Once configured, operating systems can be
loaded and executed. Operating systems provide a common programming environment for
the use of hardware resources and infrastructure. Device drivers provide a standard interface
to peripherals. An application performs the task-specific duties of an embedded system.
