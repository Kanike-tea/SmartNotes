20) Whatistheprimar yadvantageof alinkedlist?

A linked list is a very ideal data structure because it can be modified easily. This means that modifying
alinkedlist works regardless of howmanyelementsarein thelist.

21) Whatisthedifferencebetweena PUSHandaPOP?

Pushing and popping applies to the way data is stored and retrieved in a stack. A push denotes data
beingadded to it, meaning data is being “pushed” into the stack. On the other hand, a popdenotes data
retrieval ,andin particular refers tothe topmost data beingaccessed.

22) Whatisalinearsearch?

A linear search refers to the way a target key is being searched in a sequential data structure. Using
thismethod, each element in the list is checked and compared against the target key, and isrepeated until
foundorif theend ofthe list has been reached.

23) Howdoesvar iabledeclarationaffectmemor yallocation?

The amount of memory to be allocated or reserved would depend on the data type of the variable
beingdeclared. For example, if a variable is declared to be of integer type, then 32 bits of memory storage
will bereservedforthat variable.

24) Whatis theadvantageof theheap overa stack?

Basically, the heap is more flexible than the stack. That’s because memory space for the heap can
bedynamically allocated and de-allocated as needed. However, memory of the heap can at timesbe
slowerwhencompared to that stack.

25) Whatisapostfixexpression?

A postfix expression is an expression in which each operator follows its operands. The advantage of this
formisthat thereisno needtogroupsub-expressionsin parentheses orto consider operatorprecedence.

26) Whatisthedifferencebet weentheHEAPandtheST ACK?

(Solution: HEAP is used to store dynamically allocated memory (malloc). STACK stores static

data(int, const).)
