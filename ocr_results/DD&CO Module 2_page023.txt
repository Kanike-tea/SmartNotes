Dataflow Modeling

Dataflow modeling of combinational logic uses a number of operators that act on binary operands to
produce a binary result. Dataflow modeling uses continuous assignments and the keyword assign. As
an example, assuming that the variables were declared, a two-to-one-line multiplexer with scalar data
inputs A and B, select input S, and output Y is described with the continuous assignment

assign Y = (A && S) || (B && S)

The relationship between Y, A, B, and S is declared by the keyword assign, followed by the target output
Y and an equals sign.

The next two examples show the dataflow models of the two previous gate-level examples. The dataflow

D[1] = !(*1A) && B && (!enable)),

Behavioral Modeling

Behavioral modeling represents digital circuits at a functional and algorithmic level. It is used mostly to
describe sequential circuits, but can also be used to describe combinational circuits.

Behavioral descriptions use the keyword always, followed by an optional event control expression and
a list of procedural assignment statements. The event control expression specifies when the statements
will execute. The target output of a procedural assignment statement must be of the reg data type.
Contrary to the wire data type, whereby the target output of an assignment may be continuously updated,
a reg data type retains its value until a new value is assigned.

HDL Example below shows the behavioral description of a two-to-one-line multiplexer. Since variable
m_out is a target output, it must be declared as reg data (in addition to the output declaration). The
procedural assignment statements inside the always block are executed every time there is a change in
any of the variables listed after the @ symbol. (Note that there is no semicolon (;) at the end of the
