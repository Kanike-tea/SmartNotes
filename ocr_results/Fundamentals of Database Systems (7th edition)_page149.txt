4.3 Constraints and Characteristics of Specialization and Generalization Hierarchies 119

possible combinations of classes that may have some entity that belongs to all
these classes simultaneously. For example, in the overlapping specialization of
PERSON into (EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT} (or {E, A, S} for short), it would
be necessary to create seven subclasses of PERSON in order to cover all possible
types of entities: E, A, S, E_A, E_S, A_S, and E_A_S. Obviously, this can lead to
extra complexity.

Although we have used specialization to illustrate our discussion, similar concepts
apply equally to generalization, as we mentioned at the beginning of this section.
Hence, we can also speak of generalization hierarchies and generalization lattices.

4.3.3 Utilizing Specialization and Generalization in
Refining Conceptual Schemas

Now we elaborate on the differences between the specialization and generalization
processes and how they are used to refine conceptual schemas during conceptual
database design. In the specialization process, the database designers typically start
with an entity type and then define subclasses of the entity type by successive spe-
cialization; that is, they repeatedly define more specific groupings of the entity
type. For example, when designing the specialization lattice in Figure 4.7, we may
first specify an entity type PERSON for a university database. Then we discover
that three types of persons will be represented in the database: university employ-
ees, alumni, and students and we create the specialization {EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS,
STUDENT}. The overlapping constraint is chosen because a person may belong
to more than one of the subclasses. We specialize EMPLOYEE further into
{STAFF, FACULTY, STUDENT_ASSISTANT}, and specialize STUDENT into
{GRADUATE_STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT}. Finally, we specialize
STUDENT_ASSISTANT into {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT, TEACHING_ASSISTANT}.
This process is called top-down conceptual refinement. So far, we have a hier-
archy; then we realize that STUDENT_ASSISTANT is a shared subclass, since it is
also a subclass of STUDENT, leading to the lattice.

It is possible to arrive at the same hierarchy or lattice from the other direction. In
such a case, the process involves generalization rather than specialization and cor-
responds to a bottom-up conceptual synthesis. For example, the database design-
ers may first discover entity types such as STAFF, FACULTY, ALUMNUS,
GRADUATE_STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT, RESEARCH_ASSISTANT,
TEACHING_ASSISTANT, and so on; then they generalize {@GRADUATE_STUDENT,
UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT} into STUDENT; then {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT,
TEACHING_ASSISTANT} into STUDENT_ASSISTANT; then {STAFF, FACULTY,
STUDENT_ASSISTANT} into EMPLOYEE; and finally (EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT}
into PERSON.

The final design of hierarchies or lattices resulting from either process may be
identical; the only difference relates to the manner or order in which the schema
superclasses and subclasses were created during the design process. In practice, it
is likely that a combination of the two processes is employed. Notice that the
