Inkjet bioprinting works similarly to standard inkjet printing. The bioink is loaded into cartridges,
and droplets of the bioink are ejected through fine nozzles onto a substrate. The droplets form layers,
and the structure is built by depositing subsequent layers. Inkjet bioprinting allows for high-
resolution printing and precise control over droplet size, but it may be limited by the viscosity of the
bioink and cell viability during the ejection process.

Extrusion-based Bioprinting:

Extrusion-based bioprinting uses a syringe or a similar mechanism to extrude the bioink
through a nozzle. The bioink is deposited layer-by-layer to create the desired structure. This
technique is versatile and can handle a wide range of bioinks with varying viscosities, including
those with living cells or cell aggregates. It allows for high cell viability and can produce
structures with controlled porosity. However, it may have limitations in achieving high
resolution and complex geometries.
