Four-variable map

1)Simplify the Boolean function

F (w, x, y, z) = =m (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14)

Since the function has four variables, a four-variable map must be used. The minterms
listed in the sum are marked by 1’s in the map of Fig. 3.9.

Eight adjacent squares marked with 1’s can be combined to form the one literal
term y'. The remaining three 1’s on the right cannot be combined to give a simplified
term; they must be combined as two or four adjacent squares.

The larger the number of squares combined, the smaller is the number of literals
in the term. In this example, the top two 1’s on the right are combined with the top
two 1’s on the left to give the term w'z'

These squares make up the two middle rows and the two end columns, giving the term
xz'. The simplified function is
