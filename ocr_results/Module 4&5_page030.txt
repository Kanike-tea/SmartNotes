The next level is secondary storage—targe, slow, relatively inexpensive mass storage devices
such as disk drives or removable memory. Also included in this level is data derived from
peripheral devices, which are characterized by their extremely long access times. Secondary

memory is used to store unused portions of very large programs that do not fit in main memory

and programs that are not currently executing.

It is useful to note that a memory hierarchy depends as much on architectural design as on the
technology surrounding it. For example, TCMand SRAM are of the same technology yet differ

in architectural placement: TCM is located on the chip, while SRAM is located on a board.
