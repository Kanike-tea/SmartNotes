input. When the control input is 0, the output is disabled and the gate goes to a high-impedance state,
regardless of the value in the normal input. The high-impedance state of a three-state gate provides a
special feature not available in other gates. Because of this feature, a large number of three-state gate
outputs can be connected with wires to form a common line without endangering loading effects.

Graphic symbol for a three-state buffer

The construction of multiplexers with three-state buffers is demonstrated in Fig below. The construction
of a two-to-one-line multiplexer with 2 three-state buffers and an inverter. The two outputs are connected
together to form a single output line. When the select input is 0, the upper buffer is enabled by its control
input and the lower buffer is disabled. Output Y is then equal to input A. When the select input is 1, the
lower buffer is enabled and Y is equal to B.

2-to-1-line mux using three state gates

The construction of a four-to-one-line multiplexer is shown in Fig below. The outputs of 4 three-state
buffers are connected together to form a single output line. The control inputs to the buffers determine
which one of the four normal inputs Io through Is will be connected to the output line. No more than one
buffer may be in the active state at any given time. The connected buffers must be controlled so that only
1 three-state buffer has access to the output while all other buffers are maintained in a highimpedance
state. One way to ensure that no more than one control input is active at any given time is to use a
decoder, as shown in the diagram. When the enable input of the decoder is 0, all of its four outputs are
0 and the bus line is in a high-impedance state because all four buffers are disabled. When the enable
input is active, one of the threestate buffers will be active, depending on the binary value in the select
inputs of the decoder.
