Microcontrollers-BCS402

when the processor encounters an instruction that is undefined or not supported by the
implementation. User mode is used for programs and applications.

Processor mode.

Banked Register:

Figure shows all 37 registers in the register file. Of those, 20 registers are hidden from a
program at different times. These registers are called banked registers and are identified by
the shading in the diagram. They are available only when the processor is in a particular
mode; for example, abort mode has banked registers r13_abt, r14_abt and spsr_abt. Banked
registers of a particular mode are denoted by an underline character post-fixed to the mode

mnemonic or _mode.
