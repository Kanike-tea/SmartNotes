Biocompatible polymers:

Biocompatible polymers are synthetic materials that are compatible with human tissues
and do not cause adverse reactions. They can be used as the "ink" in 3D printing, providing a
supportive structure for the cells to grow and develop into functional bone tissue. Examples:
polyethylene, polycaprolactone, polylactide, and polyvinyl alcohol

Ceramics:

Ceramics, such as hydroxyapatite, are natural components of human bones and can be
used as the "ink" in 3D printing. Hydroxyapatite is a biocompatible material that has been shown
to be an effective material for 3D printing of bones. Examples: Hydroxyapatite, Calcium
phosphate, Tricalcium phosphate.

Scaffolds:

Scaffolds are structures that provide a supportive framework for the cells to grow and
develop. In the case of 3D printing of bones, scaffolds can be used to create a specific shape or
structure for the bone tissue to grow around. Examples: Polyglycolic acid (PGA), Poly-L-lactic acid
(PLLA), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

Cell-embedded materials:

Cell-embedded materials are materials that contain living cells, which can be used to seed
the 3D printed structure. The cells then grow and develop into functional bone tissue over time.
Examples: Gelatine methacryloyl, Alginate.

3D Printing of Skin

3D printing of skin refers to the process of creating three-dimensional human skin tissue
using a 3D printer. The goal of 3D printing skin is to create functional, living tissue that can be
used for a variety of purposes, such as cosmetic testing, wound healing, and drug development.
The process involves the use of bioprinting technology, where a bioink made from living cells
and growth factors is printed in a specific pattern to create the desired tissue structure.
