Binary Logic

Binary logic deals with variables that take on two discrete values and with operations that assume logical

meaning. The two values the variables assume may be called by different names (true and false, yes and

no, etc.), but for our purpose, it is convenient to think in terms of bits and assign the values | and 0.

Definition of Binary Logic

Binary logic consists of binary variables and a set of logical operations. The variables are designated by

letters of the alphabet, such as A, B, C, x, y, z, etc., with each variable having two and only two distinct

possible values: | and 0. There are three basic logical operations: AND, OR, and NOT. Each operation

produces a binary result, denoted by z.

AND: This operation is represented by a dot or by the absence of an operator.

For example, xey = z or xy = z is read “x AND y is equal to z”. The logical operation AND is
interpreted to mean that z = 1 if and only if x = 1 and y = 1; otherwise z = 0. (Remember that x,
y, and z are binary variables and can be equal either to 1 or 0, and nothing else.) The result of the
operation Xey is z.

OR: This operation is represented by a plus sign. For example, x + y = z is read “x OR y is equal
to z”, meaning that z = 1 ifx = 1 or ify = 1 or if both x = 1 and y= 1. If both x = 0 and y= 0,
then z = 0.

NOT: This operation is represented by a prime (sometimes by an overbar). For example, x' = z
(or xX =z ) is read “not x is equal to z”, meaning that z is what x is not. In other words, if x = 1,
then z = 0, but if x = 0, then z = 1. The NOT operation is also referred to as the complement
operation, since it changes a | to 0 and a0 to 1, i.e., the result of complementing | is 0, and vice

versa.
