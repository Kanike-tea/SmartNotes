12.3 The ODMG Object Model and the Object Definition Language ODL 387

important to note that many of the ideas embodied in the ODMG object model are
based on two decades of research into conceptual modeling and object databases by
many researchers.

The incorporation of object concepts into the SQL relational database standard,
leading to object-relational technology, was presented in Section 12.2.

12.3.1 Overview of the Object Model of ODMG

The ODMG object model is the data model upon which the object definition lan-
guage (ODL) and object query language (OQL) are based. It is meant to provide a
standard data model for object databases, just as SQL describes a standard data
model for relational databases. It also provides a standard terminology in a field
where the same terms were sometimes used to describe different concepts. We will
try to adhere to the ODMG terminology in this chapter. Many of the concepts in
the ODMG model have already been discussed in Section 12.1, and we assume the
reader has read this section. We will point out whenever the ODMG terminology
differs from that used in Section 12.1.

Objects and Literals. Objects and literals are the basic building blocks of the
object model. The main difference between the two is that an object has both an
object identifier and a state (or current value), whereas a literal has a value
(state) but no object identifier.'* In either case, the value can have a complex
structure. The object state can change over time by modifying the object value. A
literal is basically a constant value, possibly having a complex structure, but it
does not change.

An object has five aspects: identifier, name, lifetime, structure, and creation.

1. The object identifier is a unique system-wide identifier (or Object_id).'°
Every object must have an object identifier.

2. Some objects may optionally be given a unique name within a particular
ODMS-—this name can be used to locate the object, and the system should
return the object given that name.*® Obviously, not all individual objects
will have unique names. Typically, a few objects, mainly those that hold
collections of objects of a particular object class/type—such as extents—will
have a name. These names are used as entry points to the database; that is,
by locating these objects by their unique name, the user can then locate
other objects that are referenced from these objects. Other important
objects in the application may also have unique names, and it is possible to
give more than one name to an object. All names within a particular ODB
must be unique.
