D.8 ARMI1 Cycle Timings 663

Table D.14 ARM11 (ARMv6) instruction cycle timings. (Continued.)

Instruction class Cycles Notes

LDR pe, [sp, #off] {!} 4 +4 if unconditional and return stack is empty.

LOR pe, [sp], #off +5 if unconditional and return stack mispredicts
+4 if conditional.

LDR pe not using a At+7

constant stack offset

LDM not loading pc 1 You cannot start another memory access for the next
(N + a — 1)/2 cycles, where ais bit 2 of the address.
The kth register in the list not available for (k + a + 3)/2 cycles.

LDM sp{!} loading pe 4 +5 if conditional or return stack empty or return stack
mispredicts. You cannot start another memory access for
(N + a)/2 cycles. The kth register in the list not available for
(k +.a+5)/2 cycles.

LDM loading pe not from 8 You cannot start another memory access for (N + a)/2

the stack cycles. The Ath register in the list not available for (k + a + 5)/2

cycles.

MCR/MCRR 1 This counts as a memory access.

MRC/MRRC 1 This counts as a memory access. The result registers are not
available for two cycles.

MRS. 1

MSR to cpsr 1 +3 if any of the csx fields are updated.

MSR to spsr 5

MUL, MLA 2 Rdis not available for two cycles, except as an accumulator
input for another multiply accumulate when it is not available
for one cycle.
Rmand Rsare required one cycle early. Rn is not required until
the second cycle for MLA.

MULS, MLAS 5 Rmand Rsare required one cycle early. Rn is not required until
the second cycle for MLAS.

xMULL, xMLAL 3 RadLo is not available for one cycle. RdHi is not available for
two cycles. Reduce these latencies by one if these registers are
used as accumulator inputs for another multiply accumulate.
Rmand Rsare required one cycle early. RdLo is not required
until the second cycle for MLAL.

XxMULLS, xMLALS 6 Rmand Rsare required one cycle early. RdLo is not required
until the second cycle for MLAL.

PKHBT, PKHTB 1 Rmis required one cycle early.
